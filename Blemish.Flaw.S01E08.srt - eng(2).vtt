00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.280
Do you know about Zeng Jie?

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:36.000
Yes, I do.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.599
Come tell me more.

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:41.680
I know there are several

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:42.640
who graduated

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.319
but didn't stay in Caorong City.

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:45.159
He's really

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.359
a busy man.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.400
He's a creep.

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:48.640
Dude,

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.000
how do you know so much

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.040
about his dirty secrets?

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:54.239
To be honest,

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:55.959
my girlfriend back in school

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.840
got tricked by him.

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:58.519
My ex attended one

00:01:58.519 --> 00:01:59.239
of his classes,

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:00.079
added his WeChat,

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:02.239
and got invited to an exhibition.

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:03.640
She got infatuated by him.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.640
Later she started

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.519
dating him secretly.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:06.799
In the end...

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.520
This Zeng Jie

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.599
didn't use clever tricks.

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.080
Just hit on his students.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.680
Back then,

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.840
most guys were poor.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.039
He spent money

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.080
we couldn't afford

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.840
to dazzle those girls.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.960
Does he specifically target

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.680
girls from

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.039
poor families?

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.680
Well, exactly!

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.800
But

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.800
those girls we met

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.240
didn't look poor at all.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.879
Many people nowadays

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.039
love pretending.

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.039
The poorer, the flashier they dress.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.680
Just like I used to be.

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:36.120
So, Zeng Jie

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.520
targets them?

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.639
There might be exceptions.

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:42.240
I heard,

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:43.520
just rumors,

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.360
that our principal's daughter

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.719
is involved with him too.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.240
The principal's daughter?

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.759
Chen Yuhe, I think.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.719
She's pretty.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.479
She has a cushy job at school.

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:55.159
She seems to have

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.360
a relationship with him.

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:57.800
She definitely isn't

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.120
the poor type.

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.599
Dude,

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:02.400
think it carefully.

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:03.800
Do you know anyone

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:04.680
close to Chen Yuhe?

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.439
I need to inquire.

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:07.199
Okay.

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:09.159
Dude,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.439
want to take down him?

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.280
Did he

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.800
snatch your girlfriend?

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.680
Where did you find this guy?

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.400
I got in Caorong University's

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:21.080
alumni group

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:22.159
and knew him there.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.800
He absolutely loathes

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.840
Zeng Jie.

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:26.039
His ex

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.840
and every girl

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.520
he fancied

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:28.800
had flings with Zeng Jie.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.919
I have night duty. No.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.479
Go on.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.560
So,

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:35.840
what's your conclusion?

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.719
Zeng Jie is quite busy.

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:38.360
He hit on

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:39.240
so many girls.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.159
I bet

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.080
what this guy knows

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.039
is just part of it.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.159
But all these girls

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:44.080
share one trait.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.560
Being poor?

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:46.240
Right.

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:47.439
These girls,

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:48.199
Liu Wei,

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.919
and Lin Fang

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:49.800
are from

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.680
humble origins.

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:52.680
He targets

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:53.439
such girls.

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.280
Using his status and position,

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:56.879
plus small favors,

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.039
he preys on these young,

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.319
inexperienced girls,

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.120
making them

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.159
believe he's a good guy.

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:04.520
Lin Fang probably doesn't count.

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:06.240
Zeng Jie wasn't rich back then.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.439
But his wife

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.039
and that rich lady

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.319
are both wealthy.

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:11.599
And Chen Yuhe,

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.472
the principal's daughter.

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:14.319
This is his trick.

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:16.319
He manipulates women

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:17.079
who's useful to him

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:18.439
and treats those young girls

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.639
as playthings.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.839
Let me tell you.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.480
He's worse than a creep.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.360
He is pure evil.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.279
He understands girls well.

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:27.519
That's why he targets

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:29.240
these simple and innocent girls.

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:31.120
He knows what girls need most

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.759
to establish

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:32.959
themselves in society.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.000
He knows the trick

00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:34.800
to deceive them.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.079
So you think these

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.639
deceived girls don't know about it,

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:38.480
don't resist,

00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:39.279
or seek revenge?

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:40.680
But Liu Wei fought back.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.600
And Lin Fang.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.040
I thought Lin Fang's death

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.399
is connected to Zeng Jie.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.839
Just a thought.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.680
I know.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.720
We need evidence.

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:48.920
Right,

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:51.000
you mentioned in your message

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.440
that Zeng Jie visited Japan
during his postgraduate studies.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.792
Yes.

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:55.360
A girl got tricked

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:56.680
into going to Japan by him.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.600
Wait.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.839
Postgraduate?

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:00.040
(Oucheng Garden)
What you mentioned

00:05:00.079 --> 00:05:00.879
happened three

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:01.759
or four years ago.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.959
But actually,

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:04.079
he went there three times.

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:06.368
The first two trips were
during his postgraduate studies.

00:05:06.368 --> 00:05:07.319
Logically speaking,

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:09.079
he should've been poor and needed money.

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.120
Which was when he was dating

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.079
Lin Fang.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.160
He didn't go there with Lin Fang?

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:16.319
Not sure.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.959
But Lin Fang never went abroad.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.160
Sports car rich lady?

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.040
Maybe

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.000
Zeng Jie went

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.839
with that rich lady.

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:25.680
Don't you realize

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.759
your thoughts are messy?

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.560
Why are you digging so deep

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.920
into him?

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.319
For a case like this,

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.879
we need to dig deep into him.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.040
If we understand

00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:33.800
Zeng Jie well,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.759
we can deduce

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.439
his motives

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:36.839
for committing crimes.

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:38.199
You've watched

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.120
too many crime shows.

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:40.959
Wrong.

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:42.319
That's not true.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.519
This is literally my job.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.920
My current followers

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:45.519
aren't many,

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.360
but you can't doubt

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:47.160
my expertise.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.240
Moreover,

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.199
my video...

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.279
Hold on.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.600
Look.

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:55.839
A fan's calling.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.680
Hello, Tracy.

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.040
Can't we talk over the phone?

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.000
Tomorrow afternoon?

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:05.920
Alright, sure.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.040
She wants to see you?

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:09.639
Regarding Lin Fang,

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:11.120
she wants to discuss with me

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:12.040
about deduction

00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:12.879
and analysis.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.160
We'll meet tomorrow.

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:15.079
Impressive!

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:16.079
This fan

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.879
is a professional?

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.240
We're all amateurs here.

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:20.639
You're the professional,

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:21.319
bro.

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:30.279
I have things to do.

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:31.800
Just drop by for a coffee.

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:32.759
I'll leave soon.

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:34.319
Why telling me this?

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.639
I didn't ask you out.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.720
Just happened to run into you.

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:40.360
I'm here every day.

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:42.000
Is running into me rare?

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.480
Can I ask you a question?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.639
Go ahead.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.920
I might not answer.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.079
You come out every day.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.639
Doesn't your husband worry?

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.000
He trusts you that much?

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.720
Shouldn't he

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.519
trust me that much?

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.040
So you trust him that much too?

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.040
Why do you worry

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:06.399
about me and my husband?

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:08.720
My husband is an artist,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.879
the youngest professor

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:11.000
at Caorong University.

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:13.160
Certainly, many women

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.319
admire and like him.

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:16.000
Don't you mind?

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:17.959
I mind others being better than me.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.920
But why do I mind

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:20.160
others being worse?

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.240
Makes sense.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.560
Are you interested

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:27.600
in my husband

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:28.920
or in me?

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.040
I'm Just asking.

00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:32.160
Fine.

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:33.720
Then I'll ask too.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.480
You mentioned

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:38.000
your ex has disappeared.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.279
Have you found her?

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:43.040
You said

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.040
you don't love her

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:45.720
anymore, right?

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:46.759
Right.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.279
You have a good memory.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.439
But still searching.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:51.959
Why?

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:55.399
I don't want her

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.879
to just disappear.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:00.879
I don't want her

00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:02.600
to disappear from this world.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.519
Disappearing from my life

00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:07.079
is nothing.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.759
Will your husband come
looking for you here?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.240
You should leave.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.440
Save me the explanations.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.279
Why are you here?

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:07.600
Had business nearby.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.000
Just dropped by.

00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:13.519
With a friend?

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.480
A pour-over and an iced latte.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.519
Sometimes,

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:20.840
I'd even order milk and sit

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:21.919
all afternoon.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.240
Often drink multiple cups.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.960
Don't drink mine.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.080
You usually

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.200
sit here alone?

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.960
Of course, alone.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.360
But I don't always sit here.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.279
With no friends?

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.399
What for?

00:09:51.879 --> 00:09:53.080
To push my wheelchair?

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.440
Just thought you might be lonely.

00:09:57.399 --> 00:09:58.799
You could invite

00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.720
your friends

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.080
to go shopping with you.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:02.519
I don't want

00:10:02.559 --> 00:10:03.879
to burden others

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.679
with my inconvenience.

00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:08.919
So lately,

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.279
you've been alone.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.360
Haven't seen others?

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.559
There are staff and customers here.

00:10:17.039 --> 00:10:18.559
And I pass countless people

00:10:18.559 --> 00:10:19.399
on the streets.

00:10:19.759 --> 00:10:21.519
How could I not see others?

00:10:22.799 --> 00:10:23.679
I mean...

00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:24.679
Zeng Jie,

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.200
just get to

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.679
the point.

00:10:43.879 --> 00:10:44.919
You suddenly

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.000
mentioned Liu Wei before.

00:10:47.879 --> 00:10:48.720
Why?

00:10:50.879 --> 00:10:51.679
Because

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.679
I suddenly thought of her.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.879
Why?

00:11:03.039 --> 00:11:03.919
Starting today,

00:11:04.759 --> 00:11:06.039
let's just forget about this.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.559
Don't ever mention it,

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.000
unless we want a divorce.

00:11:14.679 --> 00:11:15.639
This dirty secret

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.159
stays buried forever.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:32.879
Want a divorce?

00:11:33.879 --> 00:11:35.039
I'm just curious

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.279
why you suddenly

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:38.600
mentioned someone

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.879
we haven't mentioned for over a year.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.759
What exactly happened

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.120
that made you think of her?

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:46.120
Or someone

00:11:46.159 --> 00:11:47.360
made you think of her?

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.360
Calm down.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.799
I just can't figure it out.

00:11:58.679 --> 00:11:59.879
I don't want to mention her.

00:12:00.159 --> 00:12:01.039
Then why?

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.720
Liu Wei had a boyfriend.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.440
Do you know?

00:12:03.679 --> 00:12:04.519
Why would I know?

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.279
I know.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.399
Liu Wei told me

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.000
her ex-boyfriend

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.559
was a video creator,

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.279
named Big Hui.

00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:17.600
What kind of videos?

00:12:17.919 --> 00:12:18.879
Shall I go check?

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.120
Anyway, that matter's settled.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.200
Can't become a barrier

00:12:28.279 --> 00:12:29.120
between us anymore.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.519
Mentioning her,

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:31.879
for you,

00:12:32.639 --> 00:12:33.360
for me,

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.000
isn't any good thing.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.080
But

00:12:37.639 --> 00:12:38.639
you mentioned her today.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.039
I just don't want this matter

00:12:41.159 --> 00:12:43.039
to affect our life again.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.080
Has it?

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.240
I just hope...

00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:46.320
Between us,

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:48.039
there's nothing left to be affected.

00:12:48.759 --> 00:12:49.440
Zeng Jie,

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.919
I don't think

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.720
you really care about our life.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.080
Anything

00:12:54.159 --> 00:12:55.399
affecting your life?

00:13:02.519 --> 00:13:03.159
Most of my life

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.519
is at work.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.240
Nothing to be affected.

00:13:07.799 --> 00:13:08.519
Good then.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.360
Hope there's nothing

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.720
unpleasant

00:13:12.039 --> 00:13:13.600
to affect Professor Zeng's work.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.120
I said it wrong.

00:13:15.879 --> 00:13:16.840
Associate Professor.

00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:26.320
(Lin Shan)
(Emergency.)

00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:27.679
Go attend to your matters.

00:13:27.679 --> 00:13:28.639
Don't neglect your work.

00:13:29.159 --> 00:13:30.480
Thanks for dropping by.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.600
Need me to pick you up later?

00:13:33.159 --> 00:13:34.080
Shouldn't you

00:13:34.159 --> 00:13:35.639
be working overtime at the studio?

00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:36.480
No need.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.200
Fine.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.480
I'll go pay the bill for you.

00:13:46.639 --> 00:13:47.759
She comes here every day?

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:48.960
Yes.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:50.960
Always alone?

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:52.759
Yes.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:14.720
Well done!

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.320
Is it necessary?

00:14:33.399 --> 00:14:34.799
Making it look like an affair.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.480
When are you leaving?

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.879
I can stay a bit longer.

00:14:39.039 --> 00:14:39.639
Okay.

00:14:39.799 --> 00:14:40.600
Let's talk.

00:14:40.919 --> 00:14:41.679
About what?

00:14:41.919 --> 00:14:42.919
Change your clothes.

00:14:43.879 --> 00:14:44.759
Go somewhere else.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.200
Where to?

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.600
When my husband was parking,

00:14:52.679 --> 00:14:53.600
and you saw him.

00:14:53.799 --> 00:14:54.679
You know him?

00:14:57.279 --> 00:14:58.279
You're investigating him?

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.120
Did you approach me

00:15:00.279 --> 00:15:01.559
to investigate him?

00:15:03.759 --> 00:15:04.480
Yes.

00:15:06.279 --> 00:15:07.840
Your ex-girlfriend was Liu Wei, right?

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.480
What's her relationship with my husband?

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.240
I don't know.

00:15:12.799 --> 00:15:14.320
But I'm certain they're connected.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.519
Did Liu Wei tell you?

00:15:17.039 --> 00:15:18.120
I figured it out myself.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:26.960
This is

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.279
an imitation of my husband's

00:15:28.279 --> 00:15:28.960
work.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Liu Wei made this.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.440
Though I don't understand ceramics,

00:15:34.879 --> 00:15:36.679
this plate was poorly made.

00:15:37.879 --> 00:15:38.600
That's why Liu Wei

00:15:38.679 --> 00:15:40.159
couldn't be my husband's student.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.360
She's not.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.799
Yet she once told me something.

00:15:46.519 --> 00:15:48.399
Pursue perfection
and approach perfection.

00:15:48.919 --> 00:15:49.960
No blemish flaws allowed.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.279
In my opinion,

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.440
she must've encountered

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:54.799
someone who said these to her.

00:15:55.559 --> 00:15:57.080
Maybe she attended my husband's

00:15:57.159 --> 00:15:58.039
classes or seminars.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.360
But after her disappearance,

00:16:00.639 --> 00:16:02.360
Zeng Jie's studio in Shuiyuan Village

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.240
caught fire.

00:16:03.639 --> 00:16:04.720
Everything was burned down.

00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:07.879
When my husband's studio caught fire,

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:08.879
I was there.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.159
It truly was an accident.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.879
But accidents can be engineered.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:13.799
Exactly.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.279
But many friends were present that day.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.200
He couldn't

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.559
possibly start the fire then.

00:16:21.159 --> 00:16:21.759
I had

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.039
visited your husband,

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.519
but found nothing.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.519
Yet Wei did disappear.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.159
I had

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.039
to investigate Zeng Jie.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.039
Therefore,

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.519
I know many things about him.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.000
Many things?

00:16:38.759 --> 00:16:39.399
Right.

00:16:40.519 --> 00:16:42.159
He had multiple affairs.

00:16:42.519 --> 00:16:43.320
To be honest,

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.919
he's never truly faithful.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.279
He married you

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.320
because of your wealth.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.600
He wanted your family's money.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.639
My parents are indeed well-off.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.960
But he built his success from scratch.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.559
That's what everyone thinks.

00:16:59.039 --> 00:17:00.120
You told me

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.840
about how you met Zeng Jie.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.000
But I believe

00:17:03.519 --> 00:17:04.640
it was a scheme

00:17:04.759 --> 00:17:06.759
that he carefully planned,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.240
to make you gradually

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.519
accept him.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.079
In that case,

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.640
I am such a fool.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.279
Or rather,

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.279
Zeng Jie is too cunning.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.839
Do you know Lin Fang?

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:22.799
Who?

00:17:23.279 --> 00:17:24.079
You don't know her?

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.440
A saleswoman at the Artist Village,

00:17:26.559 --> 00:17:27.359
average background.

00:17:27.559 --> 00:17:29.240
She was Zeng Jie's ex-girlfriend,

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.559
or rather,

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.480
his ex-wife.

00:17:35.319 --> 00:17:36.480
Are you kidding me?

00:17:38.519 --> 00:17:39.240
In rural areas,

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.200
people host a wedding banquet.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.759
Know this custom, right?

00:17:47.039 --> 00:17:47.920
Come on.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:48.960
Congrats!

00:17:50.359 --> 00:17:50.759
Here.

00:17:51.359 --> 00:17:51.839
Here.

00:17:51.839 --> 00:17:53.240
Eat up.

00:17:53.279 --> 00:17:54.240
Alright.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.519
Get wedding candies.

00:17:56.799 --> 00:17:57.799
Get wedding candies.

00:17:57.799 --> 00:17:58.200
Come on.

00:18:01.799 --> 00:18:03.119
Seems you truly didn't know.

00:18:04.519 --> 00:18:05.279
I've checked.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.000
Lin Fang is dead.

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:08.640
The timing of her death

00:18:09.079 --> 00:18:10.359
is when you and Zeng Jie

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.519
started dating.

00:18:13.319 --> 00:18:14.759
I told you I had business today.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.160
I need to meet someone

00:18:16.279 --> 00:18:17.759
who might know about Lin Fang.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.599
A young, healthy girl

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.440
would never die suddenly.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.000
If Lin Fang's death

00:18:23.079 --> 00:18:24.000
is related to Zeng Jie,

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.799
then I'm even more certain

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.400
Wei's disappearance

00:18:27.799 --> 00:18:29.240
must also involve him.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.079
Why not go to the police?

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.400
These are just my deductions.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.519
I have no evidence.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.200
So you're speculating

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.000
that my husband is a killer

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.880
or even a serial killer?

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.480
I have another deduction.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.200
Zeng Jie is someone who worked hard

00:18:48.359 --> 00:18:49.440
to make a name for himself.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.680
He tried hard

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.640
to change his fate.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.720
Before you, he met a rich lady

00:18:53.759 --> 00:18:54.920
driving sports cars.

00:18:55.119 --> 00:18:56.279
I'm still investigating her.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.400
But clearly,

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.640
their relationship

00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.680
didn't last.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.240
Then he met you

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:02.839
and married you.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.039
He got financial support

00:19:04.119 --> 00:19:05.480
from your family.

00:19:05.759 --> 00:19:07.240
From being an assistant professor,

00:19:07.359 --> 00:19:09.279
to becoming a famous
young artist overnight.

00:19:09.319 --> 00:19:10.200
He's been

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.279
using you.

00:19:12.039 --> 00:19:13.160
He doesn't love you.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.319
That's why after marriage,

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.079
he kept

00:19:15.119 --> 00:19:16.519
having affairs.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.559
When you were still physically able,

00:19:18.759 --> 00:19:19.720
he didn't go too far,

00:19:19.759 --> 00:19:20.559
avoid being caught.

00:19:20.839 --> 00:19:22.000
During that period,

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.119
Wei met him.

00:19:23.839 --> 00:19:25.000
Wei had a fiery personality,

00:19:25.359 --> 00:19:26.519
refused to be his plaything.

00:19:27.039 --> 00:19:28.359
So he had to silence her.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:29.759
After that,

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.039
he increasingly felt

00:19:31.119 --> 00:19:32.200
you hindered

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.559
his affairs.

00:19:34.279 --> 00:19:34.960
Therefore,

00:19:35.599 --> 00:19:37.440
on the night of Zeng Jie's studio fire,

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.160
he claimed

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.079
to search for you on the third floor.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:41.799
Because

00:19:41.799 --> 00:19:43.039
he assumed you were there.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.559
But, you weren't.

00:19:44.839 --> 00:19:45.720
What if you were?

00:19:46.079 --> 00:19:47.279
Would he help you escape

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.839
or block your escape?

00:19:49.039 --> 00:19:50.279
Zeng Jie had fireproof equips

00:19:50.319 --> 00:19:52.039
prepared in advance.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.400
People usually don't maintain

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.160
such precautions.

00:19:54.279 --> 00:19:55.759
You survived the fire,

00:19:55.799 --> 00:19:56.440
then

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.440
got a car accident.

00:19:57.799 --> 00:19:58.519
You mentioned

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.240
before the crash,
he took the car for maintenance,

00:20:01.279 --> 00:20:01.680
right?

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.319
After interacting with you,

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.000
I believe you're a decent person.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.279
I thought to fully investigate

00:20:14.359 --> 00:20:15.200
everything first

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.119
before telling you the complete truth.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:20.640
Big Hui,

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.279
thank you for your concern.

00:20:23.039 --> 00:20:24.079
But I must tell you

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.440
you don't know Zeng Jie.

00:20:25.839 --> 00:20:27.079
He's not that horrible

00:20:27.079 --> 00:20:28.039
as you imagine.

00:20:28.279 --> 00:20:29.799
The real horror is you being trapped

00:20:29.839 --> 00:20:30.960
in lies.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.680
I'm disabled,

00:20:33.839 --> 00:20:34.519
already living

00:20:34.519 --> 00:20:35.680
without hope.

00:20:36.519 --> 00:20:38.440
If the truth is this cruel,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.720
I'd rather be trapped in lies.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:41.720
Really?

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.680
You addressed him "My husband",

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.319
but now you used "Zeng Jie".

00:20:45.519 --> 00:20:46.839
This shows deep down

00:20:47.039 --> 00:20:48.000
you've started

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
to believe what I said.

00:20:55.079 --> 00:20:55.880
Big Hui,

00:20:57.039 --> 00:20:57.960
I really

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.759
don't want to lose you as my friend.

00:21:00.039 --> 00:21:00.920
You must realize

00:21:01.039 --> 00:21:01.759
someone like me

00:21:01.839 --> 00:21:02.880
has no real friends.

00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:08.920
Zeng Jie has stomach issues?

00:21:10.119 --> 00:21:11.359
You are wrong.

00:21:11.839 --> 00:21:13.240
His stomach is healthier than mine.

00:21:17.279 --> 00:21:18.240
Tomorrow,

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.640
will you still come to the café?

00:21:23.079 --> 00:21:23.759
I don't know.

00:21:24.359 --> 00:21:25.640
Let me think.

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:28.839
I don't know

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:29.960
how to face someone

00:21:30.119 --> 00:21:31.680
who thinks my husband's a murderer

00:21:31.759 --> 00:21:33.240
and keeps investigating him.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.519
If tomorrow,

00:21:35.519 --> 00:21:36.680
I don't go to the café,

00:21:37.519 --> 00:21:38.039
Big Hui,

00:21:38.039 --> 00:21:39.359
let's not meet again.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.680
Give me another chance.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:51.519
Two days.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:52.680
If you don't show up

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.920
in two days,

00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:55.440
I'll leave you alone.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.480
(He claims to be Lin Fang's classmate,)

00:22:04.799 --> 00:22:05.680
but Lin Fang

00:22:06.079 --> 00:22:07.680
went to elementary school
in the village,

00:22:08.039 --> 00:22:09.160
middle school in town.

00:22:09.319 --> 00:22:10.079
Her classmates

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.359
all came from nearby towns.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.440
There's no such person.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:14.880
So,

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.680
he's definitely lying.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.680
But

00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:22.240
the clothes he dressed

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.039
made me really nervous.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.559
Who is he?

00:22:25.839 --> 00:22:27.240
How should I know?

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.240
Lately,

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.880
I'm under assessment.

00:22:31.759 --> 00:22:32.839
That's it then.

00:22:33.039 --> 00:22:34.839
Must be your rivals
trying to sabotage you.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.079
Ridiculous!

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.640
Why sabotage me?

00:22:43.839 --> 00:22:44.400
Fine.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.519
In that case,

00:22:48.119 --> 00:22:49.880
if someone asks me anything,

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.839
I'll tell him the truth then.

00:23:04.559 --> 00:23:05.519
So,

00:23:06.359 --> 00:23:07.519
what did you tell him?

00:23:08.759 --> 00:23:10.160
He knows about

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.400
your wedding banquet with Lin Fang.

00:23:19.599 --> 00:23:21.000
But I told him

00:23:22.319 --> 00:23:25.240
it doesn't mean
you two got the certificate.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:27.839
And

00:23:28.119 --> 00:23:30.319
you've been separated
from my sister for years.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.000
She's been dead for ages.

00:23:33.359 --> 00:23:34.240
Died from illness.

00:23:35.279 --> 00:23:35.759
Right.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.720
Yes, exactly.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.359
But

00:23:39.519 --> 00:23:40.519
he called me again

00:23:40.599 --> 00:23:41.960
this morning

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.039
and said

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.319
to meet

00:23:45.039 --> 00:23:46.640
tomorrow for another talk.

00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:50.640
Must've found something.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.079
Think about it.

00:23:52.599 --> 00:23:54.359
I didn't even know him,

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.039
yet he tracked me down

00:23:56.039 --> 00:23:56.880
in my hometown.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.440
Weird.

00:24:01.839 --> 00:24:02.799
My history with Fang

00:24:02.839 --> 00:24:04.079
ended years ago.

00:24:05.359 --> 00:24:06.720
People around me now

00:24:07.599 --> 00:24:08.799
shouldn't know about this.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.279
If others find out

00:24:13.559 --> 00:24:14.880
about the wedding banquet,

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.599
would it affect

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.720
your assessment

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.880
in university?

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.000
No.

00:24:21.559 --> 00:24:22.359
Not really.

00:24:23.799 --> 00:24:25.599
What if your wife finds out?

00:24:27.079 --> 00:24:28.000
Nothing big.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:29.920
Then,

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.680
if he's investigating

00:24:33.079 --> 00:24:35.200
how Lin Fang died.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:44.680
Shan,

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:46.799
Fang...

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.319
You know it.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.279
She had heart disease.

00:24:52.759 --> 00:24:53.640
Heart disease?

00:24:55.039 --> 00:24:56.319
I don't know.

00:24:59.279 --> 00:24:59.920
Shan,

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.079
well...

00:25:01.359 --> 00:25:02.599
What do you mean?

00:25:03.119 --> 00:25:04.079
Scared?

00:25:10.279 --> 00:25:11.079
Not at all.

00:25:12.359 --> 00:25:12.839
Shan,

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.559
all these years,

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.160
I've done

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.079
everything I should.

00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:23.839
I know.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.759
You're my brother-in-law.

00:25:27.119 --> 00:25:28.720
I have to

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.480
protect you.

00:25:31.799 --> 00:25:32.160
Right.

00:25:32.279 --> 00:25:32.920
Besides,

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.240
I'd come to you

00:25:35.559 --> 00:25:36.799
once trouble comes.

00:25:38.039 --> 00:25:38.920
Yes, Shan.

00:25:41.799 --> 00:25:42.400
Shan,

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.920
tell me more about

00:25:44.319 --> 00:25:45.559
that guy.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:51.759
He wore a black jacket

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.559
with some blue,

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.759
with a zipper here.

00:25:56.319 --> 00:25:58.559
Looks about

00:25:59.079 --> 00:26:00.119
in his thirties.

00:26:00.319 --> 00:26:01.319
Not very tall.

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.920
Looks energetic.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.480
Take a look

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.359
if it is him.

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.079
Not sure.

00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:13.279
Can't remember.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:20.920
A while back,

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:21.880
I just gave you

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:22.920
100,000 yuan.

00:26:23.839 --> 00:26:25.559
That's for the house renovation.

00:26:26.559 --> 00:26:27.240
But

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.839
I want to start a business.

00:26:29.079 --> 00:26:30.000
Open a livestock farm.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.079
What do you think?

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.279
How much?

00:26:33.079 --> 00:26:35.400
Initial investment is

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.680
around 500,000 yuan.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.480
How much then?

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.440
I don't need your help.

00:26:39.759 --> 00:26:41.200
I'll figure it out myself.

00:26:45.319 --> 00:26:46.319
Don't, Shan.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:47.640
Look,

00:26:48.119 --> 00:26:48.960
you start a business,

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.039
and I have to support you.

00:26:54.039 --> 00:26:54.839
This money

00:26:55.559 --> 00:26:56.640
counts as my investment.

00:26:58.599 --> 00:26:59.359
Lately,

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.160
I'm tight on cash.

00:27:12.079 --> 00:27:13.400
I'll transfer you 50,000 later.

00:27:19.279 --> 00:27:19.880
Phone.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
It's him.

00:27:33.519 --> 00:27:34.960
Yes, that's the guy.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:35.960
You know him?

00:27:38.279 --> 00:27:39.400
I don't know him.

00:27:40.559 --> 00:27:41.440
But he's been

00:27:41.519 --> 00:27:42.599
causing me trouble lately.

00:27:46.119 --> 00:27:47.200
Weird.

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:48.960
How did he know

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:49.880
about Lin Fang?

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.799
Besides us two,

00:27:55.079 --> 00:27:56.119
who else knows

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.319
about Lin Fang?

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.680
Those in Artist Village

00:28:02.799 --> 00:28:03.559
might know.

00:28:04.759 --> 00:28:05.519
But this happened

00:28:05.519 --> 00:28:06.279
many years ago.

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.839
How did he

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:10.920
dig this up?

00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:16.200
Just a wedding banquet.

00:28:16.519 --> 00:28:18.200
Didn't you say it's nothing?

00:28:21.319 --> 00:28:22.519
I'm worried he'll dig deeper.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.160
But what if...

00:28:32.079 --> 00:28:32.759
(Video Surveillance)
Here's 20,000.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.319
I'll switch cards.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.319
He must've found out

00:28:40.559 --> 00:28:42.319
I worked at Artist Village before.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.680
That's not a secret anyway.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.200
He's gone to Artist Village.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.119
Someone blabbed.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:01.799
If he

00:29:02.599 --> 00:29:03.680
comes to you again...

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.799
I know what to do.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:06.680
When have I ever

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.039
messed up your plans?

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.599
I always support you.

00:30:03.799 --> 00:30:05.440
Check the bag behind.

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.039
Ms. Juan.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:23.920
Ms. Juan, this...

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:24.920
I...

00:30:25.119 --> 00:30:26.680
You need 400,000 yuan, right?

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:28.880
After you

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:29.960
finish painting,

00:30:30.319 --> 00:30:31.279
it'll be too late.

00:30:31.759 --> 00:30:32.480
No, Ms. Juan.

00:30:32.799 --> 00:30:33.880
How can I accept

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:34.799
this much money?

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:35.240
This...

00:30:35.359 --> 00:30:37.039
It's not about the amount,

00:30:37.319 --> 00:30:39.000
but timing.

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.440
You'll know

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.640
400,000 yuan

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.400
means nothing.

00:30:45.319 --> 00:30:46.319
But right now,

00:30:47.599 --> 00:30:48.640
it could collapse you.

00:31:06.359 --> 00:31:07.839
Made you yam porridge.

00:31:08.119 --> 00:31:09.920
Feeling better?

00:31:11.039 --> 00:31:12.519
Added some ribs.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:13.440
Eat it

00:31:13.559 --> 00:31:14.359
while it's hot.

00:31:22.559 --> 00:31:23.279
Here.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.039
Take this.

00:31:26.279 --> 00:31:27.079
I asked my boss

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.640
to pay me two months in advance.

00:31:29.079 --> 00:31:30.960
Plus some savings.

00:31:31.359 --> 00:31:32.440
Use this first.

00:31:34.319 --> 00:31:35.000
The hospital

00:31:35.039 --> 00:31:36.799
has been pushing you for payment.

00:31:37.079 --> 00:31:38.200
Just take it.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.839
I'm going home

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.079
to discuss with my brother.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.799
The house back home

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.400
could still sell for a good price.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.599
It's okay.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.759
Everything will pass.

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.119
Things

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.519
will get better.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.240
Definitely.

00:32:14.279 --> 00:32:15.079
I need

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:16.759
to go to school

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
to meet my teacher

00:32:20.079 --> 00:32:20.960
in the evening.

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.599
Want me to go with you?

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:23.880
No need.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.480
Tonight,

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.440
I'll stay at the dorm

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:29.359
and not come back.

00:32:31.039 --> 00:32:31.400
You

00:32:32.319 --> 00:32:33.640
need to get proper rest.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.079
Water.

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.640
Stomachache again?

00:33:00.079 --> 00:33:01.559
You're so young,

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.880
how's your stomach this bad?

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.279
Maybe because of

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.160
the seafood yesterday.

00:33:10.839 --> 00:33:11.720
You need

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.400
treatment.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:14.759
Don't ignore it.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:16.599
Or, you can't

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:17.799
enjoy delicious food.

00:33:19.839 --> 00:33:20.920
Give me

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:21.839
your passport.

00:33:24.279 --> 00:33:25.599
I don't have a passport.

00:33:26.319 --> 00:33:28.319
Then go apply for one tomorrow.

00:33:28.599 --> 00:33:29.599
After you get it,

00:33:29.799 --> 00:33:31.279
I'll arrange your visa.

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.599
I'll take you to Japan this month-end.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.480
What for?

00:33:37.839 --> 00:33:38.880
To eat sashimi.

00:33:40.839 --> 00:33:42.519
Japan has the highest number of people

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.519
suffering from stomach diseases
in the world.

00:33:45.079 --> 00:33:47.119
They're experts in treating them.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.279
I'll take you for treatment.

00:33:49.799 --> 00:33:51.279
Don't let this pain

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.440
annoy you.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:56.519
Take this.

00:33:57.359 --> 00:33:58.319
The latest model.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.079
Ms. Juan,

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.240
mine still works fine.

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:10.719
It works fine.

00:34:11.599 --> 00:34:12.519
But you can

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:14.360
still use a finer one.

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:18.440
Okay.

00:34:30.963 --> 00:34:34.944
When you talk, this and that circle...

00:34:42.131 --> 00:34:42.848
Because...

00:34:46.035 --> 00:34:46.880
Cut!

00:34:47.808 --> 00:34:48.508
Because...

00:34:51.443 --> 00:34:52.704
My fault. Sorry.

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:53.504
Cut!

♪The drowning sea isn't azure sky♪

00:35:01.235 --> 00:35:02.464
Don't know how to act.

00:35:04.211 --> 00:35:06.624
Conflict will lead to a crack,

00:35:06.624 --> 00:35:08.928
so the greater the conflict,
the bigger the crack.

00:35:10.016 --> 00:35:12.086
Just like this cracked wall.

00:35:12.992 --> 00:35:14.419
Sorry, I said the wrong line.

00:35:14.419 --> 00:35:16.288
One more. Sorry.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.624
Later I learned from others

00:35:19.072 --> 00:35:22.112
when I was little... When I was two...

00:35:22.336 --> 00:35:24.384
- Sorry, my fault. One more.
- Okay.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.744
Let's go to a hot spring
on the weekend with my friends.

00:35:28.704 --> 00:35:29.632
Where to?

00:35:32.768 --> 00:35:35.008
When have I ever caused trouble?

00:35:35.456 --> 00:35:37.088
Yesterday, someone...

00:35:37.792 --> 00:35:39.032
Sorry, one more.

00:35:40.768 --> 00:35:43.712
His stomach always ached.

00:35:44.256 --> 00:35:46.944
My sister cooked him

00:35:47.168 --> 00:35:50.592
millet porridge,

00:35:52.032 --> 00:35:54.880
and yam porridge... One more.

00:35:55.648 --> 00:35:57.984
My sister cooked him

00:35:58.496 --> 00:36:01.056
millet porridge and yam porridge...

00:36:01.216 --> 00:36:06.016
My sister cooked him millet porridge,
yam porridge and pork rib soup.

00:36:07.316 --> 00:36:08.322
Hey.

00:36:12.224 --> 00:36:15.008
That's for the house.

00:36:15.008 --> 00:36:19.296
I want to open a livestock farm.

00:36:19.744 --> 00:36:20.544
What do you think?

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.240
How much do you want?

00:36:23.136 --> 00:36:26.560
Initial investment is
around 500,000 yuan.

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:27.680
How much then?

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:31.744
After Dad's discharged,
we are so broke now.

Where can I get the money?

Just listen. I'm going home
to discuss with my brother.

00:36:42.784 --> 00:36:45.952
The house back home
could sell for a good price.
