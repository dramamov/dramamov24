00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.359
(Wei.)

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.519
(We lost touch after the breakup.)

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.079
(Where are you?)

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.280
(Paramount Ballroom)
(How are you?)

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:59.120
(I'm not sure)

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:01.840
(whether I'm doing well.)

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.560
(Life seems to have changed,)

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:11.120
(yet remains the same.)

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.680
(Our encounter, relationship,
and the breakup)

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.879
(didn't seem to affect us.)

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.280
(We've been)

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.960
(ordinary people desperately trying)

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:25.520
(to prove that we are not)

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:26.319
(ordinary.)

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.360
(But it only confirmed)

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.240
(how ordinary we were.)

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:32.560
(I know you've blocked)

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:33.319
(and deleted me.)

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.840
(You once said...)

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.199
For the ex

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.840
and ourselves,

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.240
we should always block

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:40.840
and delete their contact.

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:42.159
The sequence

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.120
matters.

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:44.360
Always block them first.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.439
And then delete them.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.680
Otherwise, you risk

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.439
unblocking them

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.400
when you're fuzzy.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.240
That's just trouble.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.280
(On this)

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.039
(ordinary day,)

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:57.599
(I remembered you.)

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.439
(But Wei,)

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:01.520
(I can't find you.)

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.360
Slow extraction.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.879
Two extra grams of grounds.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.159
Over-tamped.

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.039
It will be bitter.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.599
What will be bitter?

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.960
The coffee.

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:32.759
That guy's probably a newbie.

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:33.759
The extraction rate

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.639
was wrong.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.256
It's either too sour or too bitter.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.520
I heard

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:40.319
your questions.

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:41.599
Yang Zhenghui, age 30.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.919
Capricorn. Type B blood.

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.719
No property.

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:44.680
One used car.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.759
But

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:47.360
you didn't fancy that Audi guy

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:47.879
earlier.

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:48.639
So my ride

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.840
won't impress you.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.000
Well,

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.800
I make videos.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.719
Kind of a KOL.

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.120
Barely 100k followers.

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:55.319
Unstable income.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.360
20k on good months,

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.520
2k on bad ones.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.439
(Stopwatch)
So far,

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.400
it's been 1.5 minutes.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.159
Take a break

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.919
for six minutes.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.759
I need a smoke.

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:04.520
Is this your tactic?

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:07.319
This isn't some bar pickup.

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:08.319
What tactic?

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:09.719
Then why are you here?

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:11.759
I heard

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:12.800
about it ages ago.

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:14.400
I wanted to try it out.

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.079
I need to de-stress

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.959
from work.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.879
High-pressure blind dating

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.600
helps you de-stress?

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.800
I didn't expect it.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.680
It should be nice

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.639
to go on dates.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.639
Who knew

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.759
this'd feel like a job interview?

00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:28.480
But

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.720
if I met my future girlfriend

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.480
in such a setting,

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.560
it'd make for

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.720
dull memories.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:35.519
Was it romantic

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:36.519
when you met

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:37.079
your ex?

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:42.800
Torrential rain.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.279
She couldn't get a cab.

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:52.000
I rode past

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.519
on a Kawasaki Ninja.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.319
I asked...

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:57.839
Need a ride?

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.240
I may not be a creep.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.680
What if I am?

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:18.240
You broke up how?

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.959
It was as abrupt as when we met.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.160
You didn't ask anyone

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:26.079
about their past.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.639
Are you

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.600
interested in me?

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:29.600
No offense.

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:31.160
If it were three years ago,

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:32.560
I'd be curious about you.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.360
To be honest,

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.279
I would have

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:36.040
found you boring.

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:37.040
Why don't you

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.879
win her back?

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.496
When did you break up?

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.480
About a year ago.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.079
I should find her.

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:54.800
You're still in love?

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:55.720
No.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.920
I just want to know

00:05:57.079 --> 00:05:58.160
why she broke up with me.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.560
A word of advice.

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:07.279
No. 7 is good.

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:08.639
He's the only one who thanks

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.800
the waiter for refilling

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.680
his water.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.120
Thank you.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.240
His socks are the cleanest.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.800
Rich people

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:13.759
usually have manners.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.839
They're just boring.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.399
No. 2 is rich.

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:18.480
Plain clothes.

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:19.279
No watch.

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:20.439
But he checks his wrist.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.759
So, he took off the watch

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.319
on purpose.

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:23.439
When he pulled

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:24.279
out his phone,

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.120
the key fell out.

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:26.120
He drives a Bentley.

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:27.519
He's pretending to be poor.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.839
Totally sneaky.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.560
You're a KOL in gaming?

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.120
Add me on WeChat.

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:33.240
Carry me in ranked.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.600
Well,

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.000
I make analytical videos about

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.959
mysterious cases.

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:41.279
The Logic Behind Truth.

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:42.519
You'll be bored.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.920
Good extraction rate.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.319
It'll taste fine.

00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:02.319
(Why don't you)

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.160
(win her back?)

00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:12.759
(Are you crazy? That was fast.
Connection failed.)

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:14.560
(Just so you know, we're over.)

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:15.839
(The message was blocked.)
(You don't deserve me.)

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:16.680
(Moments)
(Goodbye.)

00:07:16.709 --> 00:07:18.281
(Temporarily Closed, Wei)

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.360
(Vivian, Following
May you all get what you desire.)

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.560
(Her posts)

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.839
(Got my hair done today.)

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.399
(Will stream if I'm back early.)

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.319
(Otherwise, see you tomorrow.)

00:07:36.448 --> 00:07:37.000
(Rich Cousin)

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.600
(Welcome, new family members.)

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:39.560
(Today,)

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.079
(I will keep showing you)

00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:42.600
(Caorong's best food.)

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:43.839
(We're visiting)

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.000
(a food street place)

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.040
(recommended by a fan.)

00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:00.279
Welcome

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.399
to my livestream.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.079
My follower recommended

00:08:03.079 --> 00:08:04.000
a nice place.

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:05.279
Same old rules. Here.

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:06.319
Have the first bite.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.199
Look,

00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:08.560
our viewer count

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.480
keeps climbing.

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:12.319
Rich Cousin?

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:16.000
Are you a fan of mine?

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:16.639
No.

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:17.920
We met before

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:18.759
with Wei.

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:19.720
(Who?)

00:08:20.079 --> 00:08:20.560
(Wei.)

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.560
(Wei, Vivian.)

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:24.759
(Guys.)

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:25.839
(A fan came to me.)

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.839
(Give me a sec.)

00:08:30.439 --> 00:08:31.399
Excuse me, dude.

00:08:31.399 --> 00:08:32.399
I'm working here.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.399
It's me, Yang Zhenghui.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.840
You and Wei streamed

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:37.960
at the flower market

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.639
last year.

00:08:38.759 --> 00:08:39.919
We had dinner together.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.559
You make videos too, right?

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:42.159
Yeah.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.080
That's me.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.639
Could you

00:08:44.639 --> 00:08:45.919
get in touch with Wei?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.799
She blocked me.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.679
I don't know any of her friends,

00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:49.559
except for you.

00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:50.399
But we're not

00:08:50.519 --> 00:08:51.679
even that close.

00:08:51.759 --> 00:08:53.279
We just did one livestream together.

00:08:54.639 --> 00:08:55.960
She quit about a year ago.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.824
(Vivian, 380 days ago)

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:58.960
Guys.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.919
It's really good.

00:09:02.039 --> 00:09:02.679
Please just

00:09:02.879 --> 00:09:04.200
reach out to her, okay?

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:07.879
Her WeChat name

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.720
is just "Wei".

00:09:09.696 --> 00:09:11.799
(Wei)

00:09:11.799 --> 00:09:13.159
Should we also

00:09:13.159 --> 00:09:14.320
get a bowl of ice jelly?

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.399
They say the ice jelly here

00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:17.919
is also amazing.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.120
Not answering.

00:09:22.279 --> 00:09:23.519
There's nothing I can do.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.039
May I add you on WeChat?

00:09:25.039 --> 00:09:26.320
Whenever she texts you,

00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:27.720
tell her I'm looking for her.

00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:29.759
In our livestream room,

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.399
a Magic Wand unlocks group chat.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.799
A Balloon unlocks VIP status.
A Rocket unlocks everything.

00:09:35.759 --> 00:09:37.360
You charge money for helping friends?

00:09:38.639 --> 00:09:40.240
Thank you for the two Balloons!

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:40.960
Thank you.

00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:42.000
I'll pay

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.759
through WeChat.

00:09:44.608 --> 00:09:46.912
(Rich Cousin)

00:09:46.912 --> 00:09:48.639
(Transferred 666 yuan)

00:09:48.639 --> 00:09:49.559
An extra Balloon

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.799
to see her Moments feed.

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:51.879
(Wei, Last 6 months visible)

00:09:51.879 --> 00:09:52.720
See for yourself.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.039
There's nothing.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:54.960
Last six months.

00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:57.279
She must have posted something.

00:09:57.879 --> 00:09:58.960
Go ask someone else.

00:09:59.039 --> 00:09:59.720
I have to work.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.320
Do you know any of

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.240
her close friends?

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.559
(Public Security)

00:10:05.559 --> 00:10:06.559
Your ex set her Moments

00:10:06.559 --> 00:10:07.000
invisible.

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:08.240
So, she's missing?

00:10:08.799 --> 00:10:09.639
What's her name?

00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:10.440
Wei.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.080
Full name.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.080
Wei, Vivian.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:15.879
Real name

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:16.919
on her ID card.

00:10:17.039 --> 00:10:17.879
And her ID number?

00:10:18.039 --> 00:10:18.639
I don't know.

00:10:19.159 --> 00:10:19.759
You don't know

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:20.960
your girlfriend's name?

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:22.848
Where's she from?

00:10:23.159 --> 00:10:24.039
I don't think

00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:25.519
I ever asked her.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:28.720
How old is she?

00:10:29.039 --> 00:10:30.120
She said she was 24.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.200
But you know how girls are

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.039
about their age.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.039
It could be wrong.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:34.960
What does she do?

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.800
She's a streamer and vlogger.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.336
- When did you break up?
- A year ago.

00:10:38.336 --> 00:10:40.160
- After dating for?
- For two or three months.

00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:44.480
You dated a year ago.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.720
You don't know her name,

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.320
occupation,

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.120
hometown,

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:47.879
and not even

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:48.799
her age.

00:10:48.799 --> 00:10:50.039
You broke up. She blocked you.

00:10:50.039 --> 00:10:50.600
Now, you say

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.519
she's missing?

00:10:53.559 --> 00:10:54.200
I know

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:54.919
you must think

00:10:54.919 --> 00:10:55.759
I'm a lunatic.

00:10:55.879 --> 00:10:56.840
But I'm not.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:57.679
She couldn't

00:10:57.799 --> 00:10:58.919
have stopped posting

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.200
for six months.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.399
That's illogical.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.120
That's why you came?

00:11:04.559 --> 00:11:05.080
I know

00:11:05.159 --> 00:11:06.120
I'm not a professional.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.440
But I'm not clueless either.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.039
I...

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.840
It may sound unreasonable.

00:11:11.919 --> 00:11:13.039
But sometimes,

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.600
we solve cases with intuition.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.559
"We"?

00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:17.360
Have you asked

00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:18.360
her friends?

00:11:18.519 --> 00:11:19.240
Yes, I have.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:19.879
Her friend

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.120
showed me her Moments.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.080
I couldn't see that.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.240
She blocked me.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.879
Why didn't her friend report it?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.799
What?

00:11:27.159 --> 00:11:28.240
I barely know her.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.519
Why should I report anything?

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.639
Because she didn't

00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:31.559
text back?

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.720
I ignore messages

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.919
from my fans every day.

00:11:34.399 --> 00:11:35.639
Should I be jailed for that?

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:36.879
Officer.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.879
That guy's mentally unstable.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.919
He made too many detective videos

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.320
and lost it.

00:11:42.759 --> 00:11:43.559
Is he using you

00:11:43.639 --> 00:11:44.519
(Rich Cousin)
as content?

00:11:44.519 --> 00:11:45.587
(Call ended)

00:11:45.664 --> 00:11:47.151
Hello. Hello.

00:11:52.639 --> 00:11:53.200
What is this?

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.639
If you think I'm doing drugs,

00:11:54.759 --> 00:11:55.679
test it for evidence.

Your ex-girlfriend

00:12:01.559 --> 00:12:02.360
may not even exist.

00:12:02.559 --> 00:12:04.240
We need solid information.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.759
What do you do?

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.279
I make analytical videos

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.200

Sorry.

Actually, that was defective.

"Master"

Last time,

It's fine.

00:15:31.919 --> 00:15:33.039
That was defective.

00:15:33.799 --> 00:15:34.559
My student sent it

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:35.200
to the hotel

with a new one.

go to the hotel

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.840
and smash it.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.360
I should thank you instead.

00:15:43.559 --> 00:15:44.279
I don't get it.

00:15:45.159 --> 00:15:45.960
Where's the defect?

00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:48.039
Near the base, on the left side.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:48.879
A blemish flaw.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.360
What is that?

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.000
It's like pores on the orange peel.

00:15:54.399 --> 00:15:55.120
Pinhead-sized.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.960
Who even looks at the base?

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.080
But it's there.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.320
So you're a perfectionist,
Professor Zeng.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.080
Master Zeng is.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.200
What an artistic place.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.480
You designed it?

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.240
Any symbolic meanings?

00:16:13.799 --> 00:16:15.480
It's just a form of expression.

00:16:16.799 --> 00:16:18.000
If communication

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.200
gets too direct,

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.480
there will be conflict.

00:16:20.879 --> 00:16:21.559
Conflict

00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:22.600
leads to rupture.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.200
The greater the conflict,
the bigger the rupture.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.600
But meanwhile, the channel

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.879
for communication widens.

00:16:30.519 --> 00:16:31.639
Just like this wall,

00:16:32.679 --> 00:16:33.759
which has lost its beauty

00:16:33.879 --> 00:16:34.799
of wholeness.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.399
Why do you make it

00:16:37.799 --> 00:16:38.960
like this then?

00:16:39.679 --> 00:16:41.240
Because it's an expression.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.360
Humans appreciate

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.000
beauty

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.840
and wholeness

00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:49.440
but are also cruel.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.679
Decay and destruction

00:16:53.399 --> 00:16:54.600
also capture attention.

00:16:57.159 --> 00:16:58.159
Thus there's

00:16:58.399 --> 00:16:58.960
a term

00:17:00.039 --> 00:17:01.320
more compelling than beauty.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.440
Poignant beauty.

00:17:12.519 --> 00:17:13.856
Is it the pottery-making process?

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
I only displayed

00:17:15.279 --> 00:17:16.279
the finished work

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.200
and the clay.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.400
Beautiful things

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.640
often start off

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:20.880
looking ordinary.

00:17:23.039 --> 00:17:24.440
Such unremarkable clay

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.160
becomes so beautiful through you.

00:17:26.759 --> 00:17:27.920
This is amazing.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
No blemish flaws?

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:30.680
None.

00:17:31.039 --> 00:17:31.599
Perfection?

00:17:32.119 --> 00:17:32.880
Near perfection.

00:17:36.039 --> 00:17:37.680
Is this where you work?

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.160
People communicate cautiously

00:17:40.319 --> 00:17:41.480
after a certain age.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:42.960
Mature thinking

00:17:43.039 --> 00:17:44.559
complicates communication.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.839
Then people often

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.480
choose silence

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.359
to save time

00:17:49.799 --> 00:17:50.440
or let's say,

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:51.799
avoid complications.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.559
Professor Zeng,

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.440
must you speak so profoundly?

00:18:06.559 --> 00:18:07.240
If I truly spoke

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.920
with profound depth,

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:10.720
you might not understand.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.359
The depth you perceive

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:13.200
is my simplest

00:18:13.359 --> 00:18:14.960
chosen words.

00:18:15.119 --> 00:18:16.359
I have communicative skills

00:18:16.759 --> 00:18:17.319
as a teacher.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.160
Otherwise,

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.599
how do I teach students?

00:18:30.279 --> 00:18:31.440
How can I be your student?

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.359
Apply for my graduate program

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.160
at Caorong University.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:36.599
But I only

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.119
enroll three students.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.000
Over 100

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:39.960
apply.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.359
Can I just learn pottery from you?

00:19:11.839 --> 00:19:12.559
A blemish flaw.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.200
Why do they occur?

00:19:18.079 --> 00:19:19.519
They are caused by uneven glaze

00:19:19.799 --> 00:19:20.519
or temperature

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.400
fluctuations during firing.

00:19:22.759 --> 00:19:23.968
Typically under a millimeter.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.519
Am I defective then?

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.599
This plate is.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:29.440
You're not.

00:19:31.759 --> 00:19:32.680
Isn't everything

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:33.920
either perfect

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:34.920
or defective to you?

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.759
Near perfection.

00:19:37.279 --> 00:19:38.000
Then smash it.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.152
First creation deserves preservation.

00:19:43.519 --> 00:19:44.200
You learned

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.359
pottery from Li?

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.799
His training class
is called Light Strokes?

00:19:48.319 --> 00:19:49.440
You can even tell that?

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.759
He was my classmate.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.839
No wonder

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.160
they display

00:19:54.279 --> 00:19:55.039
your photo there.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.519
The clay we use

00:20:00.039 --> 00:20:00.559
is bought

00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:01.559
from the same place.

00:20:06.359 --> 00:20:07.039
Would you like to

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.799
join me for dinner?

00:20:14.319 --> 00:20:14.976
Professor Zeng.

00:20:15.519 --> 00:20:16.599
I don't easily go on dates.

00:20:18.119 --> 00:20:18.880
But then again,

00:20:19.599 --> 00:20:20.559
I'm free tomorrow night.

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:23.680
Look forward to it.

00:20:37.079 --> 00:20:38.400
(Welcome to this episode)

00:20:38.559 --> 00:20:40.599
(of The Logic Behind Truth.)

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.440
(I'm your old friend,)

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.079
(Big Hui.)

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.359
(Today, we're talking)

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.400
(about the case of a man
killing and dismembering his wife.)

00:20:48.519 --> 00:20:50.839
(The Kang's Wood Chipper Murder Case.)

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.279
Big Hui.

00:20:55.079 --> 00:20:56.240
We're watching your videos.

00:20:56.319 --> 00:20:57.480
They're interesting.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.359
I'm a fan now.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.480
Many of us are watching

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.039
your videos.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.400
You don't think I'm crazy anymore?

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.880
You're definitely crazy.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:04.680
But that's why

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.960
you have done so well.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:06.680
So do you believe

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:08.160
what I'm saying now?

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.279
What do you mean?

00:21:11.599 --> 00:21:12.559
Your ex-girlfriend?

00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:13.680
Big Hui.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:14.680
We still need

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.680
solid information.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:16.992
Captain Li.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:21.799
Hello again.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:22.839
Big Hui.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:24.480
Am I popular

00:21:24.599 --> 00:21:25.440
among you guys?

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:27.440
Keep eating.

00:21:29.519 --> 00:21:30.720
Had lunch? It's on me.

00:21:32.279 --> 00:21:33.880
I heard about your case.

00:21:34.519 --> 00:21:35.240
You made

00:21:35.359 --> 00:21:36.640
all those video analyses.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.759
So you should know.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.319
We can't open a case

00:21:39.519 --> 00:21:40.200
without any info

00:21:40.319 --> 00:21:40.920
after a year?

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.000
Someone would have

00:21:42.119 --> 00:21:42.839
reported it

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
if she were in trouble.

00:21:44.279 --> 00:21:45.680
She simply blocked you.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:46.720
She's not missing.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:47.648
Captain Li.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:48.000
I...

00:21:48.039 --> 00:21:48.359
Please.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:49.759
Call me Li De.

00:21:50.279 --> 00:21:51.400
I may not know

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:52.519
her real name.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:53.880
But I know her.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:54.480
First,

00:21:54.559 --> 00:21:55.039
she can't

00:21:55.119 --> 00:21:55.839
stop posting.

00:21:56.079 --> 00:21:56.640
Secondly,

00:21:56.799 --> 00:21:58.079
she hasn't streamed in a year

00:21:58.359 --> 00:21:59.680
and she stopped uploading

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.359
videos almost a year ago.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.000
Maybe she found

00:22:03.119 --> 00:22:03.880
a respectable job.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.400
Excuse me.

00:22:05.839 --> 00:22:06.960
My job isn't respectable?

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.119
I mean,

00:22:08.279 --> 00:22:09.240
maybe she found

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.559
a stable job.

00:22:11.279 --> 00:22:12.240
That's not like her.

00:22:12.759 --> 00:22:14.359
You watch my case analysis

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:15.000
because

00:22:15.039 --> 00:22:16.160
there is logic.

00:22:16.359 --> 00:22:17.799
Logic leads to truth.

00:22:18.039 --> 00:22:18.960
You believe in

00:22:19.079 --> 00:22:19.519
my logic.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.640
Why doubt the truth?

00:22:20.759 --> 00:22:21.960
You're an officer.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.839
When doubts emerge,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.599
it's your duty to find the truth.

00:22:25.759 --> 00:22:26.319
Enough.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.599
Yes, I'm an officer,

00:22:28.079 --> 00:22:29.359
but I need an actual case.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:31.039
Fine.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.160
Your ex

00:22:32.319 --> 00:22:33.119
is missing.

00:22:33.359 --> 00:22:34.119
Then tell me

00:22:34.559 --> 00:22:35.119
her name.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:35.880
Liu Wei.

00:22:36.839 --> 00:22:37.536
You remembered?

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.359
I found out.

00:22:40.759 --> 00:22:41.319
I first

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.480
found her apartment.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:43.279
Then...

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:43.880
Wait.

00:22:45.559 --> 00:22:46.440
You didn't even know

00:22:46.559 --> 00:22:47.720
where she lived?

00:22:48.119 --> 00:22:49.440
Wanderers like us rent places

00:22:49.559 --> 00:22:50.400
everywhere.

00:22:50.559 --> 00:22:51.440
She always came

00:22:51.599 --> 00:22:52.440
to my place.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.599
But I sent her home

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:54.319
once.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.440
So I checked

00:22:55.559 --> 00:22:56.720
my ride-hailing history.

00:22:59.559 --> 00:23:00.279
I got there

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.880
and found her building.

00:23:04.519 --> 00:23:05.480
Nice apartment.

00:23:05.799 --> 00:23:06.319
It's rented.

00:23:06.319 --> 00:23:07.200
Then I recalled

00:23:07.359 --> 00:23:08.359
the floor.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:10.759
Haven't you

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:11.440
watched this?

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:14.359
Let's go.

00:23:18.039 --> 00:23:18.960
You tried hard.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:19.799
Yeah.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.039
Then I remembered

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.200
the unit she lived in.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:35.839
Wait.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.680
Who are you looking for?

00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:45.519
Luckily,

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:46.640
the landlady was home.

00:23:47.279 --> 00:23:49.039
Liu Wei? She moved out.

00:23:50.839 --> 00:23:51.759
When?

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:52.768
End of last year.

00:23:53.039 --> 00:23:53.960
The lease wasn't up.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.359
She moved out a month early.

00:23:55.839 --> 00:23:56.319
Did she say

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:57.400
where she was going?

00:23:58.039 --> 00:23:59.039
Back home, maybe.

00:24:01.519 --> 00:24:02.920
Did she come alone

00:24:03.039 --> 00:24:03.880
to pack up?

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:04.759
She didn't.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.000
Some friends of hers

00:24:06.119 --> 00:24:06.680
did it.

00:24:07.119 --> 00:24:08.599
She kept texting me on WeChat.

00:24:09.279 --> 00:24:10.119
What a nice girl.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:10.920
She never

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.319
missed a rent payment.

00:24:12.559 --> 00:24:13.240
After moving,

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.000
she even sent

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.200
a WeChat red packet,

00:24:15.559 --> 00:24:16.519
saying she couldn't

00:24:16.519 --> 00:24:17.279
come to clean up,

00:24:17.359 --> 00:24:18.759
so I should hire a cleaner.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:20.319
Do you

00:24:20.319 --> 00:24:21.279
still have her WeChat?

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.000
Could I see

00:24:22.119 --> 00:24:22.799
her Moments feed?

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.559
Yeah, wait a minute.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.440
I'll get my phone.

00:24:25.519 --> 00:24:25.880
Okay.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.720
This is the first red flag.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:29.759
The landlady may be

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.079
blocked for certain posts.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:31.920
No.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.079
She didn't show up

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:33.880
during the move

00:24:34.079 --> 00:24:35.079
or hire movers.

00:24:37.839 --> 00:24:38.720
Treating friends

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.000
to meals is pricier.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.440
Plus the 200-yuan red packet.

00:24:41.799 --> 00:24:43.079
She's bad at saving money.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.319
With a moving company,

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.119
we could track

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.079
where she moved.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.200
But her friends did it.

00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:48.440
There is no record.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:49.720
She texted

00:24:49.839 --> 00:24:50.599
the landlady

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:51.599
on WeChat

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.519
without showing up.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.160
About going home...

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.359
She said her parents
divorced and remarried.

00:24:56.519 --> 00:24:57.440
She left her hometown

00:24:57.559 --> 00:24:58.279
for college

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.759
and cut contact with them.

00:25:00.039 --> 00:25:01.079
She wouldn't go back.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:02.920
Let's hypothesize

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.440
that she was controlled

00:25:04.599 --> 00:25:05.519
by someone.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.920
They could do all that

00:25:08.079 --> 00:25:09.160
with her phone.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.119
The landlady wouldn't know
she was missing.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:12.799
Your imagination

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.440
is getting a bit wild.

00:25:14.599 --> 00:25:15.960
What's wild is my attention

00:25:16.079 --> 00:25:17.519
to detail and reasoning.

00:25:17.759 --> 00:25:19.039
The second red flag.

00:25:26.799 --> 00:25:27.920
Why are you dressed

00:25:28.039 --> 00:25:28.640
so innocently?

00:25:29.839 --> 00:25:30.880
For photos.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:32.799
Dressed innocently?

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:36.799
Why did you

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.920
buy this ugly plate?

00:25:39.599 --> 00:25:40.240
It's ugly?

00:25:41.519 --> 00:25:42.160
Isn't it?

00:25:43.519 --> 00:25:44.720
I made it.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:45.640
It's nice.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.119
I didn't expect

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.440
you'd know handicrafts.

00:25:49.319 --> 00:25:50.319
This is pottery.

00:25:51.039 --> 00:25:52.160
But it's defective.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.160
D-Defective?

00:25:55.599 --> 00:25:56.319
What's wrong?

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.480
The blemish flaws.

00:25:58.359 --> 00:25:59.160
What?

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:00.720
Look.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.359
There are holes to the left

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.599
of the woman's head

00:26:03.759 --> 00:26:04.480
and on the hem,

00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:05.920
caused by

00:26:06.039 --> 00:26:07.720
uneven glaze or temperature fluctuation.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.319
But you can still use it.

00:26:09.599 --> 00:26:10.319
It's imperfect.

00:26:10.599 --> 00:26:11.880
Why must it be perfect?

00:26:12.799 --> 00:26:13.960
I'm wasting my time.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:14.839
You don't know

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:15.599
"perfection".

00:26:17.319 --> 00:26:18.000
A quick question.

00:26:18.079 --> 00:26:18.799
Don't bother.

00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:20.400
You don't appreciate beauty.

00:26:22.759 --> 00:26:23.720
I don't?

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:24.599
So shallow.

00:26:26.319 --> 00:26:27.720
How am I shallow?

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.240
I'm just curious why these are

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.279
"blemish flaws"

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.480
and not "needle holes"?

00:26:31.759 --> 00:26:32.160
And

00:26:32.319 --> 00:26:32.880
this tiny flaw

00:26:33.039 --> 00:26:33.559
ruins it?

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:34.680
That's pathetic.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:35.559
Perfection

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:36.799
is rare in this world.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:40.920
What we can achieve

00:26:41.039 --> 00:26:42.319
is near-perfection.

00:26:42.839 --> 00:26:44.359
Perfection is an aspiration.

00:26:45.359 --> 00:26:46.799
You lack aspiration.

00:26:47.279 --> 00:26:47.720
I won't

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:48.480
waste my words

00:26:48.799 --> 00:26:49.720
with you.

00:26:53.079 --> 00:26:54.279
Seriously?

00:27:01.519 --> 00:27:02.319
A hole

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:03.599
ruins perfection?

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.000
You wanderers always sound

00:27:06.119 --> 00:27:06.960
so sophisticated?

00:27:08.759 --> 00:27:10.319
So what's the problem here?

00:27:10.559 --> 00:27:11.680
Why did she make this?

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.599
For fun?

00:27:12.759 --> 00:27:13.920
No way.

00:27:14.039 --> 00:27:15.000
Her livestreams

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.039
flopped.

00:27:16.279 --> 00:27:17.279
She was shooting

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.519
outfit changes and stuff.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.440
Low views.

00:27:19.599 --> 00:27:21.079
They lacked content.

00:27:21.359 --> 00:27:22.559
She made this

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:23.880
for one purpose.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.319
To shoot videos.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:26.359
This

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.960
is the second red flag.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:28.680
Enough.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.000
Stop creating suspense

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.000
like in the videos.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:31.880
Just tell me.

00:27:32.119 --> 00:27:33.240
She learned pottery.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.119
So she'd at least

00:27:34.279 --> 00:27:35.480
film a video about it.

00:27:35.759 --> 00:27:36.480
But she didn't.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.720
She stopped streaming
and uploading videos

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:39.519
during

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.759
her move last year.

00:27:41.039 --> 00:27:41.480
It means

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.720
she disappeared

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.039
last November.

00:27:44.519 --> 00:27:45.720
That's when you broke up

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.039
and she blocked you.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.000
We broke up

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.160
on October 20th.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.599
Vivid memory, huh?

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.240
I kept all chat records.

00:27:52.599 --> 00:27:53.240
Don't ask why

00:27:53.359 --> 00:27:54.079
I kept them.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:54.640
I'm just

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:55.440
pathetic.

00:27:57.799 --> 00:27:59.240
"Just so you know, we're over."

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.960
"You don't deserve me. Goodbye."

00:28:01.519 --> 00:28:02.640
She realized it after

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.160
three months?

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.039
Good for her.

00:28:05.079 --> 00:28:05.792
Exclamation mark.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:06.640
Are you crazy?

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:07.616
Exclamation mark.

00:28:08.359 --> 00:28:09.279
That was fast.

00:28:09.599 --> 00:28:10.720
I was in a team fight

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.039
and forgot to block her.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.519
The next day, I realized

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.119
she might be mad about something.

00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:16.039
So I waited for her

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.000
to contact me.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.839
Then she completely vanished.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:19.720
A year later,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.079
you remembered her.

00:28:21.519 --> 00:28:22.880
I just want to ask

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.400
why we broke up back then.

00:28:25.119 --> 00:28:26.000
To break up properly,

00:28:26.119 --> 00:28:27.240
I think we should

00:28:27.359 --> 00:28:28.400
at least say

00:28:28.759 --> 00:28:29.160
"Goodbye."

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:29.880
"Get lost"

00:28:30.119 --> 00:28:31.160
would've worked too.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.400
Captain Li.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.880
Do you believe that

00:28:35.079 --> 00:28:36.319
Wei is missing now?

00:28:37.119 --> 00:28:37.680
I believe

00:28:38.039 --> 00:28:38.839
she blocked you.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.079
And

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.079
call me Li De.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.720
I know my evidence

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:45.799
is insufficient.

00:28:46.119 --> 00:28:47.559
You've got zero evidence.

00:28:48.519 --> 00:28:49.519
But at least,

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.039
this could be a lead.

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.160
I need to find out

00:28:52.319 --> 00:28:52.720
where

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.640
this plate came from.

00:28:54.759 --> 00:28:55.599
What's your plan?

00:28:56.279 --> 00:28:56.960
I bet

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.079
she learned it from

00:28:58.279 --> 00:28:59.839
a pottery training class.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.359
I checked.

00:29:01.839 --> 00:29:02.480
(Caorong)
There are

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.799
about 30 training centers.

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.440
There are four

00:29:05.559 --> 00:29:06.920
(Wei's apartment)
around her home.

00:29:08.359 --> 00:29:09.319
Check them one by one?

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:09.880
No need.

00:29:10.079 --> 00:29:11.079
The "Light Strokes".

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:12.880
Other classes have

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:13.519
(Light Strokes)
generic names.

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.440
She definitely

00:29:14.599 --> 00:29:15.759
chose this one.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.359
Not bad, Big Hui.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:18.759
Want to join

00:29:19.119 --> 00:29:20.079
the police force?

00:29:20.119 --> 00:29:20.880
Cut it out.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.200
Why would you want

00:29:22.559 --> 00:29:23.759
a small-time vlogger?

00:29:23.839 --> 00:29:24.720
You're much more

00:29:25.079 --> 00:29:25.960
experienced.

00:29:28.519 --> 00:29:29.640
Alright, Big Hui.

00:29:30.319 --> 00:29:32.079
If you ever find actual evidence,

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:33.279
I'll help.

00:29:38.599 --> 00:29:39.519
When I was young,

00:29:39.799 --> 00:29:41.079
I asked Mom where Dad was.

00:29:41.799 --> 00:29:42.319
Mom said,

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.240
"He's dead."

00:29:44.319 --> 00:29:45.519
Later I learned from others

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.079
that he went abroad

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.359
when I was two years old

00:29:49.359 --> 00:29:50.200
and never returned.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.559
Mom didn't have time for me.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.759
I grew up with Grandma.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.440
After Grandma passed,

00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.519
I lost all family.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.480
I've been in boarding schools

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:02.920
since middle school.

00:30:03.119 --> 00:30:04.279
I specifically

00:30:04.319 --> 00:30:05.079
went to college

00:30:05.079 --> 00:30:06.400
far from home.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.880
I didn't care about the major

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.240
or the diploma.

00:30:10.839 --> 00:30:11.640
I just wanted

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:12.799
to leave.

00:30:20.599 --> 00:30:21.519
Neither my former self

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.640
nor my present self

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.599
is someone I like.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.200
My life

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.680
has always been a complete mess.

00:30:32.759 --> 00:30:33.519
After meeting you,

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.400
I fell for ceramics.

00:30:36.519 --> 00:30:37.799
It's not a passing whim,

00:30:38.079 --> 00:30:39.039
but genuine love.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.119
You showed me

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:44.920
that even a lump of clay

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:46.960
can be extraordinary.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:48.680
That's all you need

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.400
to know

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.400
about pottery.

00:30:53.279 --> 00:30:53.960
Are you single?

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:56.960
It mostly depends

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.200
on my mood.

00:30:58.599 --> 00:31:00.759
It depends on your mood?

00:31:00.799 --> 00:31:02.599
Few people are worthy.

00:31:03.279 --> 00:31:04.359
So I leave it to my mood.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.319
I'm with my current boyfriend

00:31:07.599 --> 00:31:09.000
purely because of my mood.

00:31:19.279 --> 00:31:19.936
Where's the car?

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.000
What car?

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:21.839
Your car.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.360
Didn't you call a designated driver?

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.160
Did I?

00:31:26.839 --> 00:31:28.279
You still have to pay, anyway.

00:31:37.319 --> 00:31:38.279
Hop on if you don't

00:31:38.599 --> 00:31:39.400
mind getting wet.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.240
Then you started dating.

00:32:04.079 --> 00:32:05.000
He makes videos too.

00:32:05.319 --> 00:32:06.319
Not so successful.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.839
So he's also a designated driver.

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.000
How long?

00:32:10.519 --> 00:32:12.240
It's been a long time. Three months.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.359
Three months

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.240
is long?

00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:15.240
Isn't it?

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.720
If being with someone feels like

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.359
an eternity,

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.000
that means

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:30.880
you stopped wanting

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:31.720
to be with them.

00:32:38.519 --> 00:32:39.279
It smells good.

00:32:39.799 --> 00:32:41.279
You hang those in your car?

00:32:42.319 --> 00:32:43.200
A granny

00:32:43.559 --> 00:32:44.960
sells those on the street.

00:32:45.599 --> 00:32:46.720
Whenever I see her,

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:47.559
I buy some

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.319
to help her out.

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.039
You're so kind.

00:32:55.599 --> 00:32:56.279
Professor Zeng.

00:32:58.039 --> 00:32:59.000
Can you show me?

00:32:59.559 --> 00:33:00.119
Show you what?

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:05.880
This is where mud

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.319
becomes extraordinary?

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.759
Mud will always be mud.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:11.599
The extraordinary

00:33:12.519 --> 00:33:14.240
was there when it was just clay.

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.599
Then I'm hopeless.

00:33:17.079 --> 00:33:18.480
I can only be a flawed product.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.039
You're not flawed.

00:33:20.519 --> 00:33:22.839
Past experiences are a refinement.

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.319
If I could walk in there,

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:30.519
burn away

00:33:30.559 --> 00:33:31.759
all the bad memories,

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.880
and emerge extraordinary,

00:33:35.359 --> 00:33:36.000
that'd be great.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.200
Why are there no chairs?

00:33:50.319 --> 00:33:51.480
I work standing up.

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:52.480
If I sit down,

00:33:52.519 --> 00:33:53.359
I might slack off.

00:33:54.359 --> 00:33:55.839
Why are there chairs downstairs?

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:56.640
I meet

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:57.640
my students there.

00:33:58.559 --> 00:33:59.200
This is where

00:33:59.359 --> 00:34:00.119
I work.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:01.799
The third floor?

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:02.960
Bedroom and terrace.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:04.559
If I work late,

00:34:05.119 --> 00:34:05.839
I stay here.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:26.800
Is it late tonight?

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:29.599
Oh right.

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.280
Time for a break-up.

00:34:34.944 --> 00:34:41.184
(Just so you know, we're done.
You don't deserve me. Goodbye.)

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:45.800
It may not matter.

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:47.199
But I'm single now.

00:34:59.578 --> 00:35:04.320
(Light Strokes)

00:35:18.079 --> 00:35:18.800
H-Hello.

00:35:19.079 --> 00:35:19.519
Sir.

00:35:19.719 --> 00:35:20.119
Hello.

00:35:20.119 --> 00:35:21.480
How can I help you?

00:35:21.639 --> 00:35:22.639
C-Could you check

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:23.360
if this plate

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.719
was made here?

00:35:27.159 --> 00:35:28.000
Yeah, it's from

00:35:28.679 --> 00:35:29.239
our trial

00:35:29.239 --> 00:35:29.840
classes.

00:35:31.159 --> 00:35:31.800
Do you

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.840
recognize this girl?

00:35:35.679 --> 00:35:36.360
She's pretty,

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.159
but I don't remember her.

00:35:38.679 --> 00:35:39.079
We have

00:35:39.119 --> 00:35:40.599
many trial participants.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:41.920
They usually

00:35:42.119 --> 00:35:42.920
only come once.

00:35:43.559 --> 00:35:44.719
She didn't take courses.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:45.360
Otherwise,

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.159
I'd remember.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:51.280
Would you

00:35:51.559 --> 00:35:52.559
like to try?

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:54.400
Yeah.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:55.440
Yeah.

00:35:56.719 --> 00:35:57.880
Yeah, I...

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.159
So many ceramics.

00:36:01.599 --> 00:36:02.559
Take a look first.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.960
Why do these ceramics

00:36:09.159 --> 00:36:10.119
have blemish flaws?

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:12.159
You're an expert.

00:36:12.639 --> 00:36:13.920
Blemish flaws are common.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:15.559
Aren't they

00:36:15.639 --> 00:36:17.320
supposed to be defective products?

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.280
Who told you that?

00:36:19.559 --> 00:36:20.880
You taught your students that.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.119
You must've misunderstood.

00:36:23.559 --> 00:36:24.800
Some master artists pursue

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:25.719
perfection,

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.760
so they can't stand blemish flaws.

00:36:28.039 --> 00:36:29.159
But normally,

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:30.280
it's acceptable.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.679
What kind of master can't stand

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:33.840
blemish flaws?

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.599
Real masters.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.199
Those exceptional

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:38.559
artistic experts

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:39.880
with numerous awards.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:40.920
Do you have

00:36:41.079 --> 00:36:42.039
such a master here?

00:36:43.079 --> 00:36:45.159
Professor Zeng Jie

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.599
is our boss's classmate.

00:36:46.679 --> 00:36:47.400
He's an honorary

professor here.

00:36:48.719 --> 00:36:49.360
Does he come

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.440
to teach students?

00:36:50.719 --> 00:36:51.079
Yeah.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.039
Whenever possible,

00:36:52.239 --> 00:36:52.920
he comes over

00:36:53.079 --> 00:36:53.920
to offer guidance.

00:36:54.119 --> 00:36:56.519
T-The plate he's holding...?

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.000
That's Professor Zeng's

00:36:58.119 --> 00:36:58.920
award-winning work.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.280
A masterpiece.

00:37:01.039 --> 00:37:01.679
Here,

00:37:02.199 --> 00:37:03.039
our courses focus

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.199
on replicating master's works.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:05.960
Therefore,

00:37:06.199 --> 00:37:08.360
our program is highly professional.

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.199

Yeah.

Yeah.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:14.480

00:37:53.119 --> 00:37:53.639
Why did we

00:37:53.719 --> 00:37:54.599
start dating?

00:37:55.519 --> 00:37:56.280
I was blind.

00:37:57.079 --> 00:37:58.239
I'm serious.

00:37:59.639 --> 00:38:00.760
Are you serious?

00:38:01.159 --> 00:38:02.159
How am I not serious?

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.679
We were at similar stages

00:38:04.679 --> 00:38:05.599
in life.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.480
We saw our future,

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.039
but were struggling.

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:11.000
Our jobs

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.159
required us to face people,

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.480
yet we only saw cameras.

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.639
We were both lonely and understood

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.639
each other's

00:38:20.639 --> 00:38:21.519
loneliness.

00:38:25.679 --> 00:38:26.800
Isn't it cringe

00:38:27.039 --> 00:38:27.800
to be so serious?

00:38:34.199 --> 00:38:35.440
We happened to meet.

00:38:36.079 --> 00:38:36.760
We happened

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:38.880
not to mind each other.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.159
We were single.

00:38:41.199 --> 00:38:41.920
It happened

00:38:43.079 --> 00:38:44.320
that neither of us needed to

00:38:44.519 --> 00:38:45.559
explain our jobs

00:38:45.679 --> 00:38:46.800
to each other.

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:48.559
It happened

00:38:49.679 --> 00:38:51.400
that you could carry me in games.

00:38:55.559 --> 00:38:56.440
When we met,

00:38:56.639 --> 00:38:57.639
I felt secure

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.119
sitting on your bike.

I'll find you.

When did you break up?

00:40:21.152 --> 00:40:22.400
About a year ago.

00:40:22.656 --> 00:40:23.304
No.

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.960
