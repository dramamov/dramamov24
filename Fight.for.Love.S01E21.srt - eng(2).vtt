00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.150
Your Highness.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.680
Do you have any idea

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.070
where I was earlier?

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.590
You had 18 cases

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.200
of betrothal gifts

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.240
delivered to Miss Song.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:09.680
It was a spectacle.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.680
It's now the talk of the town.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.630
Are you saying this

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.840
to mock me?

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.800
Qingping and I have been engaged.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.680
But when I arrived,

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.920
she broke it off

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.360
in public.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.630
It must have spread

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.280
all over the city.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.240
You're the Crown Prince.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.910
Every move you make

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:44.910
catches attention.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.400
What you actually do

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.430
does not matter.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.680
Besides,

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:49.750
compared to you,

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.120
this breakup case

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.310
would have a much greater impact

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:54.910
on Miss Song.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.870
Chu Linyang.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.680
You really know how to keep your cool.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.470
For a man like you,

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.470
Qingping refused to be

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.310
the Crown Princess.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.960
You must be

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.000
feeling very proud now.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.960
With all due respect,

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.280
I'd like to be frank, Your Highness.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.240
What Miss Song did

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.800
surprised me as well.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.470
But regardless of whether

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.800
she truly meant to break it off,

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.240
she and I

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.120
weren't meant to be.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.310
Are you saying this

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.520
to calm me down,

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.590
because of who my father is?

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.120
Your Highness,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.280
instead of guessing

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.310
whether I'm the reason

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.240
Miss Song broke it off,

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.470
you should think more

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.560
about whether you can give her

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.080
the life she wants.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.590
If you can't,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.280
she would still make

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.560
the same choice

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.240
even without me.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.980
(Sui)

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.880
General.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.750
Every time you're upset,

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.630
you do this.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.120
Is it because you just said something

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:31.920
that you didn't mean?

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.040
Which part of that

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.000
wasn't the truth?

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:38.710
The truth

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.720
may not be true feelings.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:42.790
Huajing City

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.870
isn't where I belong.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.870
I belong

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.560
on the battlefield.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.910
One day,

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.070
I will return to Fengling City.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.040
I must get back

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.800
what I lost there.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.000
Miss Song

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.040
isn't a caged bird.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.680
But she's a noble lady, after all.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.870
If we're destined to part forever,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.070
why do we even start?

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.620
(Spring Breeze House)

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:40.470
Jin,

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.230
this is for you.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.760
Jin,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.840
I broke my promise.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.110
It was my fault.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.840
Hit me.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.270
No, no, no.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.510
She's a gentle lady.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.310
She won't hit me.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.310
Come on, Song Wenchang.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.120
Tuantuan dared to break up

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.960
with His Highness.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:09.560
Why are you so nervous

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.070
about apologizing to Jin?

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.830
Whether she can forgive me

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.640
depends on you.

it must be a gift

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.250
from Mr. Song.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.640
He must have realized

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.120
he was wrong.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.360
If a gift could make up

for a broken promise,

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.040
then no one would ever be at fault.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.430
Since he has his ambitions,

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.040
I will let him go.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.360
It's not like I have to marry him.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.560
My Lady,

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.000
this is just your grief talking.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.120
Look, you came here.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.200
What does that mean?

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.630
It means

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.190
you still care about Mr. Song

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.000
and you will forgive him, right?

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.270
No.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.520
I came here

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.800
to make my point

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.870
with him.

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:29.600
I just thought a lot.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.030
I will not violate my principles

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.270
for a man like him.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.750
When he was making his decision,

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.840
he might have thought of me.

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:41.200
But he went there anyway.

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:44.870
It means I'm not that important

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.360
to him.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.270
He broke his promise first.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:55.200
I can't trust him with my life.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.910

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.440
After that, he and I

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.000
will be even.

has been converted to cash.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.080
Did her letter say why she wanted

to break up with you?

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:50.030

to Dingfeng Valley.

Yes.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.230
I promised Jin

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.990
I would never go to the battlefield.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:59.800
But if I make contributions

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.700
on the battlefield,

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.120
won't she benefit too?

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.060
I'm a skilled fighter anyway.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.220

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:07.860
it might seem trivial

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.500
in your eyes.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.740
But to Ms. Chu Jin,

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:13.180
you even failed to keep

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.060
such a small promise.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.380
How can she ever trust you again?

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:23.900
822.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:24.860
(Duke of Hu's Mansion)

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.020
823.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.340
- You weren't at work.
- 824.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.380
- So, you're tired of writing.
- 825.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:31.700
Now, you use a sword.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.220
826.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:34.860
Chusheng.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.100
Why are you here?

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:37.900
Zhang An told me

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.220
you quit your job

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.900
and will join the army.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.220
I will be Minister of Personnel.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.380
There'll be a vacancy

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.220
for my old position.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:47.740
Are you sure you will

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.020
leave at this time?

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:08.700
This sword

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:09.980
is heavier than I imagined.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:13.860
But swinging this sword

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.500
is easier for me

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.340
than writing at work.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:19.940
Now, generals are in high demand.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.700
There, I'll have more chances

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.020
to stand out.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:24.860
After all,

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.380
I'm from a military family.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:27.700
Father lifted the ban

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:28.980
that prevented his sons

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:29.820
from going to war.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.100
I should try.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.140
Besides, Chusheng,

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:39.940
your path and mine

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:42.540
are destined to vary.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.820
What if Wenchang

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.180
steals your thunder?

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.980
He doesn't have what it takes.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.260
I'm sparkling in the family.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:52.820
My other brothers

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.420
complain a lot about me.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:56.300
My eldest brother

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.380
has been hearing

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:58.620
a lot of rumors.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.340
He doesn't bother.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:01.980
But he has stood up for me.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.940
On the battlefield,

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:04.980
weapons have no eyes.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.100
People get hurt.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.420
It's time

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:08.900
I protected him.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:11.940
I hope you'll get what you want.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:14.300
What about you?

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.500
Have you thought

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:16.660
about using the Crown Prince

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.780
to break away from the Duke of Ning?

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:20.940
That's the plan.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.660
But I need to be patient.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.140
Master,

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.700
Ms. Chu Yu sent a message, asking

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.180
to meet you at Spring Breeze House.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:32.900
I didn't dare to tell Madam.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.700
So, I brought it to you.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.380
(To Gu Chusheng)

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.060
(I'll see you at the Shen hour
at Spring Breeze House.)

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.500
(Bring what you found
at Qinxi Valley. By Chu Yu)

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:49.780
Since Mrs. Wei saved you

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:50.860
from the Gu family,

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.020
the two of you have reconciled.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.340
But Chusheng,

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:57.540
I've heard

00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:59.900
since she returned to her own family,

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:01.820
she hasn't got along

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:02.660
with Wei Yun.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.580
She wants to see you at this time.

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:07.900
You must think carefully.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.020
At last, she has to come to me.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:11.780
You're right.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:13.580
I should think carefully.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.220
(Duke of Ning's Mansion)

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.060
Did he really go out?

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.460
Not only did he go out,

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:34.940
what's even stranger,

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.180
he was wearing a new outfit.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:38.980
He must be meeting someone

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.580
very important.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:48.980
No one but Chu Yu

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:51.780
can make him

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:52.780
care about his looks.

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:55.600
- It's a good place.
- Really?

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.530
I told you about it.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:57.620
- Welcome.
- Is it fine?

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:58.890
- This way, please.
- Alright.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.140
Let's sit over there.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.710
What would you like to eat? My treat.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:02.670
- Anything.
- Sit.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.140
Mr. Gu, you seem surprised

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.180
to see me here.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:42.700
Yu is married,

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.020
and so are you.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.540
You shouldn't meet alone.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.180
These days, in Huajing City,

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.300
people gossip a lot.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:49.580
As her brother,

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.020
I have to be here.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:53.900
Mr. Gu,

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:55.260
take a seat.

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:10.900
Mrs. Wei, what is it you want

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:12.380
to see me about?

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:13.380
I think you know why.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.300
What on earth

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.260
did you find

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:17.420
at Qinxi Valley?

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:23.900
Is this the only reason

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:25.780
you wanted to see me?

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:27.300
Or what?

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.540
Thank you for your fair judgment

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.260
that brought Yao Yong to justice.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:45.860
After we parted,

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:47.900
you were gone for days.

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:49.820
I meant to see you,

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.140
but I was held back

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:51.980
in Yao Yong's case.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.180
Compared to that,

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.180
I would rather hear you say,

00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:58.820
"Be safe."

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:04.580
Where is that stuff?

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.380
Yao Yong is dead.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.620
Everything is settled.

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.580
(15 supply carts sent by General Yao
have entered North Qi.)

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:22.900
(20 spies to serve General Yao.)
Is this clue

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.300
still that important?

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:25.460
Of course.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:27.740
This secret letter

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:29.740
indeed can prove Yao Yong's sin.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:31.380
I also thought that

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:32.860
by sending killers after you,

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.140
Yao Yong aims to
divide me and Wei Yu,

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.780
so he can crush us individually.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.100
But Yao Yong did not know

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.120
anything about it.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.210
He even believes

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.140
Wei Yun and I

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.620
would appear at Dingfeng Valley.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.180
So it was someone else

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:51.660
who wanted to kill me.

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:54.980
But the paper of this letter

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:56.540
is ordinary.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.660
And you read it.

00:16:59.020 --> 00:16:59.860
Nothing is special.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.000
In that case,

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.540
why don't you give it to me?

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:03.980
I'll keep pursuing it.

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:05.340
Maybe I can find

00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:06.220
some new clues.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.060
Yu,

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:08.540
it's very hard

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:09.660
to investigate alone.

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:11.660
Let me

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:12.780
do it with you.

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:19.060
You're Minister of Justice.

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:20.860
It's indeed your duty

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.380
to clean up North Qi remnants.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:24.660
But after holding it

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.580
for some days,

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:27.980
you made no progress.

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:29.740
Why don't you let Yu do it?

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.500
She may achieve something.

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.660
And I will accompany her.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.260
She won't be alone.

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:43.700
Am I

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:44.900
interrupting?

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.260
Gu, you're so well dressed.

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.540
I thought you would
meet an honored guest.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.220
So, you were meeting Mrs. Wei

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.700
and General Chu.

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.540
I don't think we should get involved

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.620
in your conversation.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.420
So, we'll take our leave.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.260
Chu Yu.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.460
Now that I'm here,

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.700
let's make everything clear.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:21.900
I'm always a decent woman.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.340
But today,

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.300
I will lay everything out

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.060
and make it clear

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:29.700
between you and Gu

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.460
regardless of my dignity.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:33.140
He never dared

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.020
to ask you something.

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:35.930
I'll ask for him, too.

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:36.790
Linlang.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.100
General Chu is also here.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.260
You tell me in his face.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:42.940
Will you and Gu

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.860
get back together?

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.460
Haven't you figured it out yet?

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:54.860
It's not Chu Yu who stands between us.

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.660
It's you and your father

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.060
who stand between Chu Yu and me.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:06.940
Indeed.

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.380
My father forced you to marry me.

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:13.140
But your career

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:13.980
also took off

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:14.980
with my family's power.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:17.140
Gu Chusheng,

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:21.420
you can't be so ungrateful.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:23.940
You can't pursue power

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.140
and Chu Yu at the same time.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.340
You're right.

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.900
I was forced.

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:38.860
But I did get

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:39.700
what I wanted.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.540
But I, Gu Chusheng,

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.140
will never be a puppet

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.700
of you and your father.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:51.820
Linlang,

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:54.380
you think I'm greedy.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:57.780
Then tell me.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.060
When your father held a dagger

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.580
to my neck,

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.540
what would you choose if you were me?

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:26.580
Chu Yu,

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.140
did you hear that?

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:33.540
Wang Linlang,

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:36.940
it's never me who stands

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.140
between the two of you.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.300
And it's not you who stands

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:41.700
between the two of us.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:43.460
Your problem

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:44.940
doesn't concern me.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.060
Linyang, let's go.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.660
(Spring Breeze House)

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:09.580
Linlang,

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.020
you're a good woman,

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:13.340
but I only love her.

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.700
I was telling the truth.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.100
It's not Chu Yu

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:21.940
but your father

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:24.580
who stands between us.

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:26.540
If I hadn't been made

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:28.180
to marry you like that,

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:30.940
you and I might not be so miserable.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.260
I know you hate him.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:44.140
But after all,

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.700
I am the reason

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.100
he's been forcing you.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.260
I know you want me

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.100
to back down.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.220
Back down?

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:02.580
Your father colluded with outsiders,

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:04.980
trying to kill me.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:10.420
Did he also do that

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:11.420
to make me back down?

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:12.900
What are you saying?

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:15.580
That's impossible.

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.540
My father wouldn't do that.

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.220
Gu,

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:20.420
my father arranged everything

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.260
to get you back from the southwest.

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:24.140
He cleared your record,

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:25.340
got you in the exam,

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.620
and even made you Minister of Justice.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:29.940
Everyone at court knows

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:31.580
you're his most trusted man.

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:32.700
Why would he kill you?

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:33.940
No one but your father

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.460
knew where I was that day.

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:38.020
This is all I need to say.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:03.220
What Gu Chusheng just said

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.540
was intended for you, perhaps.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:07.180
I know.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:08.660
He even used Ms. Wang

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:09.900
to make sure I would know.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:11.820
He's trying to make me relent.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.460
It seems that he knows me better

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:16.420
than I think he does.

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.100
Then, Yu.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.740
He didn't have a choice then.

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.340
The two of you...

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:26.540
We won't be back together.

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:28.500
Nothing will help.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.140
After all,

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.100
he had a third option.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:33.780
To explain everything to me

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:34.740
and face it with me.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.140
But he didn't.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:38.340
A woman like me

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:39.620
will only look forward.

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:48.420
What's so funny?

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:50.700
Well, it's...

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.020
There was a time

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:54.780
when I said the same

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:55.940
to Wei Yun.

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:06.580
Come on. One more.

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:07.980
Congratulations, Yun.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.020
You've had revenge.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:10.540
Cheers.

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:25.460
What's wrong?

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.060
What's bothering him?

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.860
Can't you see?

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:32.180
He's trapped in love.

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:33.980
I know.

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:35.460
Then, who does he like?

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.380
Do you really not know that?

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:40.580
Just tell me.

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:44.660
Ms. Chu Yu.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:45.940
I knew it.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:46.940
Tragic, huh?

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:48.100
But in that case,

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.740
our seniority will get messed up.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:50.700
He and Ms. Chu Yu...

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.460
Ms. Chu Yu is his sister-in-law.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.140
What shall I call her, then?

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:16.420
What are you doing?

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.940
I'm the one who sees
a lot of pretty women

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.020
but cares for none of them.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.420
In Huajing City,

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.980
I'm known to all,

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.140
loved by all,

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:28.980
and supported by all.

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.260
Do you need our help?

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:43.700
(Always Fortunate, Always Propitious)

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.060
(Chu Mansion)
Take a look.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.500
Make the lanterns align.

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:55.500
- Sure.
- Be careful.

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:56.340
Alright.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:02.340
Leave this to me.

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:03.820
Alright.

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:10.300
The two of you, hang it properly.

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:11.430
- Sure.
- Alright.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.220
(15 supply carts sent by General Yao
have entered North Qi.)

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.800
(20 spies have been sent
into Great Sui to serve General Yao.)

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:20.860
My Lady!

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:23.260
Master! Madam!

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:24.860
Come out and see!

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:57.340
Mother,

00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:58.980
so many treasures.

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:00.940
Jin.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:07.300
(Wei)
Wei?

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:09.700
So, I'm sure

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.180
these things are for Chu Yu.

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.060
Why did they deliver

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:15.220
so many gifts?

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:19.300
Wei.

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.500
Marquis of Zhenguo is here.

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:06.140
Why are you here?

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.220
Don't be so disrespectful.

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.180
Yeah.

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.500
Don't scare him away.

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:15.860
I'm here for Ms. Chu Yu.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.100
Young Marquis,

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:29.420
what do you mean?

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:31.460
Greetings, Madam Chu.

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:32.780
And General Chu.

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:34.340
Ms. Chu Yu got married

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.220
in such haste.

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:36.580
It took us

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:37.740
a very long time

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:38.580
to regain our status.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:39.740
So, her wedding

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:40.580
was delayed.

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:42.100
These are

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.060
some thank-you gifts for her.

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:45.580
Please check.

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:53.180
Mother, let me do it.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:54.300
I'm good at that.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:58.340
(Catalog)

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:01.380
It's so generous of His Lordship.

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:03.020
Thank-you gift?

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:04.820
Why do I think

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:06.740
they're like betrothal gifts?

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:12.900
Speaking of which,

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:14.420
Yu married into your family

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:16.780
without traditional marriage rituals.

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:19.060
It seems that

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:20.460
you're making it up

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:21.500
for General Wei.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:23.540
That's not true.

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.420
I'm not doing this for him.

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:32.340
So, on whose behalf

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.660
are you doing this?

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:37.780
On his own behalf, of course.

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.180
We have regained our status

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:41.780
with Ms. Chu's great help.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:43.980
If my parents were alive,

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:45.740
they would also prepare...

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:50.700
The thank-you gifts.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.100
I'm just doing this

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:52.940
for my parents.

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:56.980
What if I ask you

00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:58.940
for a divorce paper?

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:00.740
Then, as the former Mrs. Wei,

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:02.220
she still deserves

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:03.060
all these things.

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:07.460
Thank you, Young Marquis

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:08.300
for your generosity.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.100
But I don't think

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:12.340
she wants the paper now.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.340
What are they talking about?

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:26.260
Are you sure?

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:37.900
My brother is right.

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:39.660
I need to think it over.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:45.100
Stop talking in riddles.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:46.940
I don't understand.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.580
It's getting late.

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:50.940
Your Lordship,

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.340
why don't you stay for a meal?

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:53.660
- No need.
- Alright.

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:56.620
Young Marquis is here

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.020
with so many gifts,

00:30:58.300 --> 00:30:59.940
but you don't keep him for a meal.

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:01.100
If it gets out,

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:02.340
people will laugh at us

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:04.020
for being impolite.

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:04.860
That's right.

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:07.020
Your Lordship,

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:07.980
come in, please.

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:10.940
Thank you, Madam Chu.

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:13.820
But without Ms. Chu's permission,

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:15.940
I wouldn't have it.

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:22.460
Come in, please.

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:27.900
Make yourself at home.

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:29.460
Eat more.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:30.940
Thank you, Madam Chu.

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:32.500
Here. Have some more.

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:35.580
- It's enough.
- It's fine.

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:37.100
- Really.
- Help yourself.

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:42.940
Yu,

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:44.580
I had our cook make this.

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:45.580
Taste it.

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:47.220
Does it taste the same as before?

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.060
It's delicious.

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:56.060
Linyang,

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:57.820
why do you only

00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.260
serve her food again?

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:03.740
Here.

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:05.220
This is for you, Jin.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:06.740
Alright?

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:09.100
But I don't like fried fish.

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:11.620
When Linyang serves you food,

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.100
just say thank you.

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.100
Don't be so obstinate.

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:16.380
Or what will you do

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:17.940
when you get married?

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:22.260
Your Lordship,

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:24.620
sorry for that.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.460
Please excuse her.

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:27.540
It's nothing.

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.420
Don't worry, Madam Chu.

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:34.180
I knew

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:35.220
you would be

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.420
a most polite man.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:37.940
Now your family

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:39.980
has restored its vitality.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:41.740
Many matchmakers

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.860
are scrambling
to arrange a marriage for you.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:45.300
I was wondering,

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.420
have you decided
whom to marry?

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:52.620
Not yet.

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.180
Your Lordship,

00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.620
you're impressive.

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.100
At such a young age,
you've done much in war.

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:04.140
And you're from a noble family.

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:06.380
You certainly have high standards.

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:08.380
It's too soon to think of that.

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:09.900
Currently,

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.420
you're a leading general.

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.580
It's time you considered

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:14.340
your marriage thing.

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:17.220
I have someone in mind

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.940
who would be a good fit.

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:26.620
I wonder if you will

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:27.740
think about it.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.620
You don't need
to get Chu Yu's consent.

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:35.780
Do you yourself want to?

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:55.500
What do you think of our Chu Jin?

00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:57.620
- No.
- No.

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:02.460
Why?

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.380
You're both single.

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:05.580
Besides,

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:07.490
military families
have made repeated merits.

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:08.420
Now,

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:09.500
His Majesty has permitted

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.460
marriages between military families.

00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:15.140
I can tell that you don't

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:16.420
reject our family.

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:19.180
Chu Yu is a good woman.

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.140
Chu Jin is

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:23.660
even better.

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:31.380
Mother has a point.

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:34.100
However,

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:35.780
the three of you said no.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.980
There should be reasons.

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:39.620
Tell Mother the reasons.

00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:43.500
- Jin, you go first.
- I...

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.460
But I want Ms. Chu Yu

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:45.940
to say it first.

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:53.620
Anyone who lives

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:54.700
in the Wei family

00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:55.580
needs martial arts.

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:57.940
Jin has no martial arts at all.

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:00.220
She can learn.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.260
I can teach her.

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:12.620
Why don't you tell me

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:15.060
what kind of woman

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:15.900
would fit me?

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:21.060
A woman whom you like

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.620
and who likes you back.

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:31.540
Mother,

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:33.300
I'll never marry a man

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.660
who goes to war.

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:36.220
This is my rule.

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:37.300
- You...
- Yeah.

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:38.140
I agree.

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:39.500
Warriors may die in the war.

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:41.980
It's risky to marry me.

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:47.660
You guys talk.

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:49.220
I have things to do.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:50.300
I'll take my leave.

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:53.740
Young Marquis,

00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:57.620
let's play chess.

00:35:58.180 --> 00:35:59.020
Shall we?

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:05.260
Let's go.

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.220
Why are you taking me

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:07.060
to Chu Mansion?

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:08.420
Jin doesn't want to see me.

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:10.500
Didn't you say

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:11.900
Young Marquis Wei

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:12.860
took Mr. Lu's advice

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:14.060
and delivered betrothal gifts?

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:15.020
Don't you want

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:15.860
to take a look?

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:17.860
Besides,

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:19.580
since when have you been so timid?

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.500
Ms. Chu Jin doesn't come to you.

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:26.900
But you can go see her.

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:32.260
Right.

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:33.940
You're right.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.140
Let's go.

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:38.740
Catch up.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:42.420
You little fool.

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:44.700
Young Marquis Wei is perfect.

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:46.060
Even your brother helps you

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:47.220
to find out his thoughts.

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:48.900
You must seize the opportunity.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:50.300
Oh, Mother.

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:52.920
My heart belongs to someone else.

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:55.780
I just haven't made up my mind.

00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:59.350
Don't make a mismatch.

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:00.940
I'm doing this for your good.

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:02.060
You silly girl.

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.140
So many dishes aren't finished.

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:42.620
Do you think this game

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:44.700
can be won?

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:47.500
It's not the end yet.

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:49.980
No one can predict.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:53.780
You're playing

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.420
in quite an unusual way.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:56.940
Special, indeed.

00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:58.820
Before, I didn't like

00:37:58.820 --> 00:37:59.660
to play like this.

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:02.780
In that case,

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:04.260
you're behaving

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:06.460
quite like Yu.

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:14.490
There's nothing wrong
with being unusual.

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.540
Conforming isn't wrong, either.

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:18.900
But when making a decision,

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:20.580
one should ask himself

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:22.340
what he really wants.

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:24.620
Sounds like you have

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:25.700
thought very clearly.

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:29.580
It won't be

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:33.100
an easy road.

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:39.340
But if I do nothing,

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:42.140
I will regret it.

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:44.580
You can regret in a game.

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:46.460
But human life

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:49.780
is always limited.

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:57.060
Young Marquis,

00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.260
I have to remind you.

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.380
You're accustomed to battles.

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:03.300
But it doesn't mean

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:04.140
you can do

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:05.580
something else without scruple

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:06.420
just like that.

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:08.500
I know you're impatient.

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:10.020
But you have to wait

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:12.260
and see if the other person has decided

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:13.980
and whether she wants

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.260
to fight a way out with you.

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:21.220
By then,

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:24.940
will you help me

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:26.980
remove the obstacles?

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:30.380
Or will you stand in my way?

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:33.260
Yu is my sister

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:35.500
and the pearl of this family.

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:37.580
What I choose

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:39.380
doesn't matter.
