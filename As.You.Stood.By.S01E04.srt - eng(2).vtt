EP 04
EUN-SU AND HUI-SU

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.329
He's already back?

00:01:00.248 --> 00:01:01.249
What the heck?

00:01:15.805 --> 00:01:18.266
Did something happen? You're early.

00:01:19.225 --> 00:01:21.728
What's that flight ticket about?

00:01:24.856 --> 00:01:25.732
What flight ticket?

00:01:25.815 --> 00:01:26.900
For Shanghai. Tomorrow.

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:30.153
The one-way ticket for me.
What's that about?

00:01:30.737 --> 00:01:32.071
I'm not sure what you mean.

00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:34.866
Tell me. You really don't know?

00:01:54.135 --> 00:01:55.762
So you are up to something.

00:01:57.805 --> 00:01:59.849
Eun-su was just about to leave.

00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:22.830
Honey, what's wrong?

00:02:49.524 --> 00:02:51.693
Well, well. What's this?

00:02:52.402 --> 00:02:53.444
What are you two up to?

00:02:56.823 --> 00:02:58.074
Stop that!

00:02:58.783 --> 00:02:59.701
Goddamn it.

00:02:59.784 --> 00:03:00.785
Just get out.

00:03:04.998 --> 00:03:06.249
Fucking unbelievable.

00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:07.709
Get up.

00:03:09.877 --> 00:03:10.712
Stop.

00:03:15.883 --> 00:03:16.884
Wow.

00:03:25.018 --> 00:03:27.979
Get up. Hey, what's your deal?

00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:33.401
For fuck's sake!

00:03:35.403 --> 00:03:36.779
Stop it! Stop.

00:03:49.208 --> 00:03:50.460
What's with you two?

00:03:50.543 --> 00:03:52.628
Hey, Jo Eun-su. Look at me.

00:03:55.256 --> 00:03:57.258
Didn't I warn you to stay in your lane?

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:00.261
Leave the marital affairs
to the married couple.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:06.911
Hey.

00:05:10.206 --> 00:05:11.874
You were gonna kill me with this?

00:05:12.834 --> 00:05:15.461
How, exactly? Like this?

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.923
-Like this?
-Let go!

00:05:19.424 --> 00:05:20.508
-You.
-Get it off!

00:05:21.676 --> 00:05:22.677
You know what?

00:05:24.303 --> 00:05:26.722
I'm fucking immortal, you hear?

00:05:27.723 --> 00:05:29.100
Go on. Try and kill me.

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:33.062
You should die. Die, damn it!

00:05:35.356 --> 00:05:36.566
Die!

00:06:11.267 --> 00:06:14.103
No, Hui-su! Hui-su, stop.

00:06:17.982 --> 00:06:18.816
Fuck.

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:14.539
Eun-su, you need to go.
You were never here.

00:07:15.206 --> 00:07:17.291
-What do you mean?
-I did this alone.

00:07:17.875 --> 00:07:19.043
No, we did this.

00:07:19.126 --> 00:07:20.336
Eun-su!

00:07:22.547 --> 00:07:24.215
This changes nothing.

00:07:24.298 --> 00:07:26.717
Mr. Jang will leave tomorrow as planned.

00:07:27.468 --> 00:07:30.555
Then we bury Noh Jin-pyo,
and that'll be the end of it.

00:08:05.131 --> 00:08:06.132
Get it together.

00:08:38.122 --> 00:08:39.081
Hello.

00:08:39.165 --> 00:08:41.876
I had some tangerines at home,
so I brought some over.

00:08:42.793 --> 00:08:44.337
I bought these just now,

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.672
but they expire today,
so I thought I'd share.

00:08:48.007 --> 00:08:51.344
I'm sorry, but I've caught a cold.

00:08:51.427 --> 00:08:54.388
Could you please just leave them
by the door? Thank you.

00:09:24.043 --> 00:09:27.088
SORRY, SCRATCHED YOUR CAR
PLEASE CONTACT ME, UNIT 1401

00:09:29.674 --> 00:09:32.009
What if she came up
because she noticed what we did?

00:09:33.803 --> 00:09:35.096
How could she?

00:09:35.721 --> 00:09:37.682
She knows I get beaten.

00:09:44.271 --> 00:09:47.024
Even still,
I bet she was checking in on you.

00:09:47.108 --> 00:09:48.734
She even left you her number.

00:09:49.527 --> 00:09:52.988
What if she came to check in on me,
caught on, and decided to call the cops?

00:09:53.906 --> 00:09:55.991
She hasn't seen anything to report.

00:09:56.617 --> 00:09:58.411
We just need to stick to the plan.

00:10:24.812 --> 00:10:25.980
Are they at it again?

00:10:26.063 --> 00:10:27.481
No, it felt different today.

00:10:27.982 --> 00:10:30.693
I went upstairs earlier,
and she had someone over.

00:10:30.776 --> 00:10:31.736
Why did you go there?

00:10:31.819 --> 00:10:33.487
To give her some tangerines.

00:10:34.572 --> 00:10:36.741
Honey. Let's go eat some tteokbokki.

00:10:37.366 --> 00:10:39.285
-All of a sudden?
-I'm suddenly craving it.

00:10:39.368 --> 00:10:40.244
I just showered.

00:10:40.327 --> 00:10:41.996
It tastes better fresh.

00:10:42.079 --> 00:10:44.206
Hyeon-ji! Let's go out
for some tteokbokki!

00:11:28.876 --> 00:11:29.794
I'll clean that.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:33.756
Sure.

00:11:51.565 --> 00:11:56.821
ALWAYS AND FOREVER
02.26.2020

00:12:36.151 --> 00:12:38.779
Ready, set, go.

00:12:38.863 --> 00:12:42.700
Friends walk through life together

00:12:42.783 --> 00:12:46.245
Though the days of the past
Are gone forever

00:12:46.328 --> 00:12:50.040
A single word can last a lifetime

00:12:50.124 --> 00:12:51.917
And in a single glass of wine…

00:12:53.794 --> 00:12:55.296
Come on. Sit back down!

00:12:59.633 --> 00:13:00.634
Off you go, then!

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.564
I'm covering the tab, so help yourself.

00:13:14.481 --> 00:13:16.734
Yes, sir. Everyone's having a great time.

00:13:16.817 --> 00:13:19.403
Who knows when you'll have
decent Korean food again?

00:13:38.088 --> 00:13:39.673
Why head home all of a sudden?

00:13:40.883 --> 00:13:42.343
Something going on back home?

00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:48.891
I just miss my son.

00:13:59.401 --> 00:14:00.653
Hard to argue with that.

00:14:07.117 --> 00:14:07.952
Your boat ride?

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:10.663
All set and safe?

00:14:11.246 --> 00:14:13.624
Where are you leaving from? Pyeongtaek?

00:14:15.376 --> 00:14:16.210
Gunsan?

00:14:22.383 --> 00:14:23.217
Incheon?

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.301
Yes.

00:14:25.427 --> 00:14:27.054
Security's pretty tight there.

00:14:27.137 --> 00:14:29.306
They've even started sweeping the docks.

00:14:34.395 --> 00:14:37.398
You mean Incheon Port,
not Incheon Airport, right?

00:14:38.482 --> 00:14:39.525
Of course not.

00:14:42.027 --> 00:14:45.656
It's not like you could hop on a plane,
even if you wanted to.

00:14:48.993 --> 00:14:51.578
If you're running from trouble,
I can't cover for you.

00:14:52.913 --> 00:14:54.123
It's nothing like that.

00:14:54.623 --> 00:14:56.125
Have you told Jo Eun-su…

00:14:58.127 --> 00:14:59.169
that you're leaving?

00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:08.053
Who is this Jo Eun-su, sir?

00:15:17.146 --> 00:15:19.857
She's been by our warehouse,
so I thought you'd met.

00:15:20.524 --> 00:15:22.109
Go on. I'll have another smoke.

00:15:22.609 --> 00:15:23.444
Yes, sir.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:00.355
MR. JIN SO-BAEK

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.655
Your call cannot be connected. Leave a--

00:16:14.787 --> 00:16:16.038
MR. JANG KANG

00:16:48.487 --> 00:16:49.321
POWERING OFF

00:16:51.532 --> 00:16:54.034
RESETTING DEVICE

00:17:40.747 --> 00:17:42.583
We washed all these last night.

00:17:43.167 --> 00:17:44.543
I figured I'd wash them again.

00:17:49.923 --> 00:17:52.342
The entire house reeks of perfume.

00:17:53.635 --> 00:17:56.013
I thought I'd spray some perfume.
Is it too strong?

00:17:57.264 --> 00:17:59.224
We sprayed the entire place yesterday.

00:18:02.895 --> 00:18:05.105
Well, nice smells make you feel good.

00:18:11.028 --> 00:18:12.112
Did you wipe the phone?

00:18:13.739 --> 00:18:14.573
Yes.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:23.874
Hello?

00:18:25.876 --> 00:18:27.127
Already?

00:18:31.715 --> 00:18:34.384
My eyes just popped open.

00:18:35.344 --> 00:18:36.345
Come on in.

00:18:54.529 --> 00:18:55.614
I guess nice homes

00:18:56.782 --> 00:18:58.075
smell good too.

00:19:18.345 --> 00:19:21.098
I asked you to come over
to give you another suit.

00:19:21.181 --> 00:19:22.015
Looks good on you.

00:19:24.851 --> 00:19:25.852
Thank you.

00:19:27.604 --> 00:19:28.605
For the bag too.

00:19:30.315 --> 00:19:33.360
I'll give you the passport at the airport.
Is this all your stuff?

00:19:34.903 --> 00:19:38.740
Yes. I don't have much to take home
except for what you gave me.

00:19:43.036 --> 00:19:45.872
I called you a cab.
You can take this with you.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:47.541
Right.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.090
Your cab should be here soon.

00:20:00.178 --> 00:20:01.013
This…

00:20:14.192 --> 00:20:15.027
Gosh.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.035
Allow me.

00:20:38.967 --> 00:20:39.801
Wow.

00:20:40.886 --> 00:20:41.720
Thank you.

00:20:42.679 --> 00:20:43.805
All right.

00:20:47.642 --> 00:20:50.062
I'll see you later, then.

00:20:50.145 --> 00:20:50.979
Okay.

00:21:18.757 --> 00:21:20.634
First floor. The doors are closing.

00:21:49.413 --> 00:21:50.414
Just over there.

00:21:50.497 --> 00:21:52.124
Drop me off right up there.

00:22:02.342 --> 00:22:03.468
I'll call when I'm done.

00:22:31.204 --> 00:22:32.622
PARKING VIOLATION NOTICE

00:23:08.074 --> 00:23:09.242
Black plastic bags.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:20.754
Eun-su?

00:23:25.258 --> 00:23:26.259
It's me.

00:23:35.352 --> 00:23:36.394
Jin-young.

00:23:37.562 --> 00:23:38.939
Were you expecting someone?

00:23:39.022 --> 00:23:42.400
Just the girl downstairs.
She's got my food container.

00:23:43.485 --> 00:23:45.028
You must be pretty close

00:23:45.612 --> 00:23:47.280
to answer the door barefoot.

00:23:51.284 --> 00:23:53.286
Jin-pyo wears sneakers like these?

00:23:53.995 --> 00:23:57.207
He only wears them
when he's volunteering at work.

00:23:58.124 --> 00:23:59.125
Sounds like him.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.378
Can I use the bathroom?

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.215
It's probably going to get a bit messy.
Is that okay?

00:24:05.298 --> 00:24:06.132
Of course.

00:24:27.862 --> 00:24:29.281
When did I get blood on there?

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:42.877
What's that smell?

00:24:43.837 --> 00:24:46.381
I accidentally knocked over
the diffuser earlier.

00:24:47.048 --> 00:24:48.049
Right.

00:24:50.468 --> 00:24:51.845
Have a seat on the couch.

00:24:51.928 --> 00:24:53.430
I should head out soon.

00:25:02.981 --> 00:25:05.734
-My socks are clean.
-Would you like some coffee?

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:07.777
Sure.

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:20.332
Jin-pyo's at work, right?

00:25:21.958 --> 00:25:23.627
I called him on my way here,

00:25:24.294 --> 00:25:25.629
but I guess he's busy.

00:25:26.129 --> 00:25:27.547
Is something the matter?

00:25:34.346 --> 00:25:35.305
Not really.

00:25:35.388 --> 00:25:36.598
Just called to check in.

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:40.226
I'll just have some water before I leave.

00:25:54.199 --> 00:25:56.451
Seems like this guy's to blame.

00:25:59.287 --> 00:26:00.413
I see.

00:26:01.414 --> 00:26:02.957
There's a small chip here.

00:26:04.626 --> 00:26:06.252
I'll go get you some water.

00:26:13.843 --> 00:26:14.678
By the way,

00:26:15.512 --> 00:26:18.598
weren't there a bunch
of picture frames up there?

00:26:24.854 --> 00:26:25.939
Did you two argue?

00:26:28.733 --> 00:26:29.567
Your water.

00:27:46.269 --> 00:27:47.270
Get in.

00:28:24.641 --> 00:28:25.809
NOH JIN-PYO

00:28:26.851 --> 00:28:29.646
You must have found
a great investment opportunity, sir.

00:29:16.109 --> 00:29:17.902
Here's the code for the suitcase.

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:32.166
BATTLE ROBOT

00:29:57.233 --> 00:30:00.904
Jin-pyo, I'm on track to be reviewed
for the presidential office dispatch.

00:30:01.529 --> 00:30:04.991
They screen the family too, you know.
Please stay out of trouble.

00:30:06.075 --> 00:30:07.285
DELETE MESSAGE

00:30:26.512 --> 00:30:27.722
It can't be.

00:30:29.641 --> 00:30:31.851
He wouldn't have hit her
with the snow globe.

00:30:43.154 --> 00:30:45.114
Especially in your private life.

00:30:47.742 --> 00:30:48.576
DELETE MESSAGE

00:31:08.805 --> 00:31:09.639
Yes?

00:31:10.598 --> 00:31:14.185
When you get to Shanghai, don't forget
to use the foreigners' immigration line.

00:31:15.728 --> 00:31:16.729
Of course.

00:31:24.028 --> 00:31:27.365
As soon as you land,
turn it on, then off, and discard it.

00:31:28.449 --> 00:31:29.450
Understood.

00:31:30.159 --> 00:31:31.494
And don't look back.

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.663
Farewell, Mr. Noh Jin-pyo.

00:32:01.858 --> 00:32:04.027
-Hello?
-Mr. Jang just went in.

00:32:06.112 --> 00:32:06.946
Okay.

00:32:07.905 --> 00:32:10.825
And Noh Jin-pyo's younger sister
texted his phone.

00:32:12.243 --> 00:32:13.453
She came by earlier.

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:15.621
What? Why?

00:32:16.622 --> 00:32:18.249
She saw the snow globe too.

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:22.670
Well, the text had nothing to do
with that, so don't worry.

00:32:23.963 --> 00:32:27.008
She told him to keep his private life
quiet for her review.

00:32:27.592 --> 00:32:29.719
So he even had a private life
to keep discreet.

00:32:33.139 --> 00:32:34.140
Okay.

00:36:47.643 --> 00:36:49.145
Wait, I was just leaving.

00:36:50.187 --> 00:36:54.025
I've seen one too many people say that
and never actually leave.

00:36:54.108 --> 00:36:56.694
If the tenants' rep sees me
letting things slide, I'd get the boot.

00:36:56.777 --> 00:36:57.737
PARKING VIOLATION NOTICE

00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:00.698
I understand,
but my friend is on her way down now.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.658
Which block and unit number?

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:05.536
This one. Block 2.

00:37:07.038 --> 00:37:08.748
I swear, she'll be right down.

00:37:09.999 --> 00:37:10.833
Please? I just…

00:37:10.916 --> 00:37:12.001
What are you doing?

00:37:12.084 --> 00:37:13.753
-I'm sorry, sir. Please.
-Hey, why--

00:37:13.836 --> 00:37:14.670
Eun-su.

00:37:16.213 --> 00:37:17.840
Ms. Jo. Please get in.

00:37:17.923 --> 00:37:19.633
Let me peel that off for you.

00:37:24.847 --> 00:37:26.724
We have to be on our way. Thank you, sir.

00:37:26.807 --> 00:37:27.808
Pleasure, ma'am.

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:47.036
Give me one sec.

00:38:09.141 --> 00:38:10.142
Let's go.

00:38:47.471 --> 00:38:48.556
Let's go faster.

00:38:49.348 --> 00:38:52.017
We can't risk an accident
since we can't call insurance

00:38:52.852 --> 00:38:54.228
or go to the hospital.

00:38:58.315 --> 00:38:59.900
I just want this off my back.

00:39:00.401 --> 00:39:01.902
I want it to be over quickly.

00:39:28.596 --> 00:39:29.930
Hui-su, what's wrong?

00:39:31.348 --> 00:39:32.183
What is?

00:39:33.058 --> 00:39:35.186
Did you get something on your hands?

00:39:36.103 --> 00:39:38.063
Oh, my palms are just sweaty.

00:39:44.195 --> 00:39:46.071
Are you sure you're okay?

00:39:47.364 --> 00:39:48.199
Yes.

00:39:53.954 --> 00:39:55.831
Don't do that, Hui-su.

00:39:56.332 --> 00:39:58.626
You don't have anything on your hands.

00:40:00.419 --> 00:40:02.046
Okay, I'll stop.

00:41:17.621 --> 00:41:19.331
What's so funny?

00:41:22.126 --> 00:41:23.711
Darn it. That's our usual spot.

00:43:23.831 --> 00:43:25.833
She must've arrived late last night.

00:45:30.833 --> 00:45:32.918
You have gone off route.

00:45:36.547 --> 00:45:38.966
You have gone off route.

00:47:38.585 --> 00:47:40.337
I'll go buy us something to drink.

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:10.701
Excuse me. Can you ring me up?

00:48:19.876 --> 00:48:21.044
How much are these?

00:48:22.546 --> 00:48:23.797
Those? 5,000 won.

00:49:43.919 --> 00:49:45.045
You must've been hungry.

00:49:45.128 --> 00:49:46.129
I guess I was.

00:49:48.715 --> 00:49:49.841
All right.

00:49:51.176 --> 00:49:53.428
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you.

00:49:58.308 --> 00:50:00.727
I don't have to skim off the scum, right?

00:50:00.811 --> 00:50:02.562
Who even does that?

00:50:04.731 --> 00:50:05.732
Right?

00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:11.071
Let's dig in.

00:50:15.283 --> 00:50:17.327
She must use local rice.

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:20.622
-The rice is perfect. So delicious.
-Take your time.

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:25.168
I think I might have to ask
for another bowl of rice later.

00:50:25.669 --> 00:50:26.503
Go ahead.

00:50:38.098 --> 00:50:38.932
Hui-su.

00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:41.059
Hui-su?

00:50:42.644 --> 00:50:44.479
Are you sure you don't need help?

00:50:44.563 --> 00:50:45.564
Yes, I'm fine.

00:50:46.439 --> 00:50:47.691
Can you close the door?

00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:00.453
Ma'am, we'd like to pay.

00:51:01.329 --> 00:51:02.330
Coming.

00:51:10.463 --> 00:51:11.673
That'll be 25,000 won.

00:51:13.717 --> 00:51:14.718
Sure.

00:51:20.056 --> 00:51:21.057
Here you go.

00:51:32.611 --> 00:51:34.029
Are you okay to go back?

00:51:40.285 --> 00:51:41.786
I guess so, but…

00:51:44.247 --> 00:51:45.624
I really don't want to.

00:53:18.341 --> 00:53:19.592
Did you sleep well?

00:53:20.844 --> 00:53:21.678
Yes.

00:53:25.265 --> 00:53:26.391
We should get back.

00:53:29.978 --> 00:53:30.979
We should.

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:38.528
From this point on,
you'll have a lot to face on your own.

00:53:41.114 --> 00:53:42.032
I know.

00:53:49.706 --> 00:53:51.958
But number 35, Jo Eun-su,
will be right beside you.

00:53:55.253 --> 00:53:58.173
And number 36, Jo Hui-su,
will be right there with you.

00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:08.475
Should we turn on our phones?

00:54:09.351 --> 00:54:10.185
Okay.

00:54:18.777 --> 00:54:21.154
MISSED CALLS, MISSED MESSAGES

00:54:36.378 --> 00:54:37.629
MR. JANG KANG

00:54:48.556 --> 00:54:50.517
PUDONG, SHANGHAI

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:52.727
Mr. Jang Kang has made it there safely.

00:54:54.813 --> 00:54:56.147
Gosh, that's a relief.

00:55:20.338 --> 00:55:22.882
-That stings.
-Those shoes sure are pretty.

00:55:23.758 --> 00:55:24.926
But they're… What's that?

00:55:25.009 --> 00:55:26.428
What is it, babe?

00:55:27.137 --> 00:55:28.930
What? Why is this so sunken?

00:55:29.514 --> 00:55:30.348
Careful.

00:55:31.224 --> 00:55:32.434
Seriously, what the…

00:55:33.852 --> 00:55:35.311
Are you really going to go home?

00:55:48.783 --> 00:55:51.244
MY SON

00:56:21.608 --> 00:56:25.153
There was a serious crash up ahead.
Please make way for the ambulance, ma'am.

00:56:26.779 --> 00:56:28.364
Move to the side, all the way!

00:56:29.073 --> 00:56:30.575
There must've been an accident.

00:56:31.284 --> 00:56:32.660
Is the ambulance close?

00:57:06.194 --> 00:57:07.570
There's blood on your car.

00:57:08.071 --> 00:57:09.697
Right, that was a water deer.

00:57:09.781 --> 00:57:10.615
A water deer?

00:57:11.241 --> 00:57:16.371
Yes, I hit it by accident
while heading to a family grave.

00:57:23.795 --> 00:57:25.171
I'll just check your trunk.

00:57:29.884 --> 00:57:30.718
He can't.

00:57:35.348 --> 00:57:36.975
I ask that you cooperate, ma'am.

00:57:39.727 --> 00:57:41.646
Please open the trunk for me, ma'am.

00:57:44.983 --> 00:57:45.984
Ma'am?

01:00:52.712 --> 01:00:57.717
