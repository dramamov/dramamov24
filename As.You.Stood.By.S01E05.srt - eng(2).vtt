EP 05
EUN-SU, HUI-SU, AND JIN SO-BAEK

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:41.521
I'll just check your trunk.

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:47.110
He can't.

00:00:52.115 --> 00:00:53.741
I ask that you cooperate, ma'am.

00:00:57.787 --> 00:00:59.414
Please open the trunk for me, ma'am.

00:01:04.586 --> 00:01:05.587
Ma'am?

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:10.925
Kim, get over here!

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:12.010
Coming, sir.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.240
You sure you don't need me to come up?

00:01:34.741 --> 00:01:35.575
I'm good.

00:01:37.452 --> 00:01:38.286
All right.

00:01:39.287 --> 00:01:42.332
Don't think about anything.
Just grab a bite and go to bed.

00:01:43.416 --> 00:01:44.250
You too.

00:01:46.085 --> 00:01:46.920
Hey, Hui-su?

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.010
Go on.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.676
MR. NOH JIN-PYO

00:02:40.974 --> 00:02:42.976
The doors are opening.

00:02:49.941 --> 00:02:54.070
RECIPIENT: MR. NOH JIN-PYO

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:16.050
Wow, they say
there's a world of a difference--

00:03:17.677 --> 00:03:19.012
When you're practicing,

00:03:19.095 --> 00:03:21.889
raise the golf club
slightly above the surface--

00:04:28.164 --> 00:04:31.584
No, Hui-su, you can't! Please, no!

00:04:32.168 --> 00:04:33.211
Let's kill him.

00:04:50.395 --> 00:04:53.606
When I finally came to my senses,
time had already flown by.

00:04:54.107 --> 00:04:56.984
Everyone else seemed to be
living their lives just fine

00:04:57.568 --> 00:04:59.278
while I was frozen in time.

00:05:00.613 --> 00:05:04.283
That's when I realized
that nothing will change

00:05:05.284 --> 00:05:06.577
if you don't do anything.

00:05:08.204 --> 00:05:12.041
And one day, I found that
the stream had taken a new turn.

00:05:14.335 --> 00:05:18.214
Of course, the stream
may become narrower or rougher.

00:05:20.049 --> 00:05:22.468
The path may twist and turn.

00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:26.556
But if I keep flowing down it,

00:05:27.265 --> 00:05:29.058
surely I'll end up somewhere.

00:05:50.204 --> 00:05:52.748
I really didn't want to adopt
this habit of Mom's.

00:06:50.681 --> 00:06:52.225
He didn't come to work?

00:06:58.147 --> 00:07:00.399
What? He didn't come to work?

00:07:01.025 --> 00:07:02.777
You weren't aware either, ma'am?

00:07:04.153 --> 00:07:07.490
Please contact us
as soon as you hear from Mr. Noh.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.450
Yes, of course.

00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:13.037
JIN-PYO'S OFFICE

00:07:16.123 --> 00:07:17.750
Have you heard from Jin-pyo yet?

00:07:19.961 --> 00:07:22.296
You haven't heard from his office either?

00:07:26.676 --> 00:07:28.970
Why? Did you notice something?

00:07:30.721 --> 00:07:32.807
His passport is gone.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.476
What do you mean?

00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:38.521
Along with his travel suitcase.

00:07:39.438 --> 00:07:42.149
You mean he left the country
without telling anyone?

00:07:43.442 --> 00:07:44.694
I'm not sure.

00:07:47.488 --> 00:07:49.574
Did you tell his office about this?

00:07:51.242 --> 00:07:53.202
I told them just now when they called.

00:07:53.286 --> 00:07:54.996
I'll see what I can find out.

00:07:55.538 --> 00:07:57.039
Let me know if he gets in touch.

00:07:58.165 --> 00:07:59.000
Okay.

00:08:15.933 --> 00:08:17.018
Hey, you busy?

00:08:18.644 --> 00:08:22.148
Could you check
a departure record for me real quick?

00:08:22.231 --> 00:08:25.359
Once his departure is confirmed,
both Noh Jin-pyo's office

00:08:25.443 --> 00:08:27.403
and your sister-in-law
will have to drop it.

00:08:28.029 --> 00:08:29.071
Let's wait until then.

00:08:30.531 --> 00:08:31.365
Right.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:33.784
Bye.

00:08:46.088 --> 00:08:50.509
INCIDENTS AND ACCIDENTS
TOP STORIES

00:09:03.606 --> 00:09:07.610
UNIDENTIFIED MALE BODY, 30S

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.467
He deposited five billion won
a few days before leaving the country

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.511
and withdrew a portion of it on this day.

00:09:34.637 --> 00:09:38.015
He deposited five billion won a few days
before his departure?

00:09:38.099 --> 00:09:38.933
Yes.

00:09:39.016 --> 00:09:40.601
Feel free to tell us anything.

00:09:42.687 --> 00:09:43.521
Well,

00:09:44.939 --> 00:09:48.359
frankly speaking,
Mr. Noh has recently been

00:09:48.442 --> 00:09:51.946
hell-bent on landing a major client.

00:09:52.029 --> 00:09:53.406
In the end,

00:09:53.489 --> 00:09:56.158
he managed to land that account
just before he left.

00:09:57.034 --> 00:09:58.619
It was worth exactly that sum of money.

00:10:00.287 --> 00:10:03.874
Now, judging by the way
things have unfolded,

00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:07.670
he might have been planning all along
to rob his client and flee overseas…

00:10:10.589 --> 00:10:11.424
Oh dear.

00:10:11.507 --> 00:10:14.301
Wait, so are you saying
that Deputy Branch Manager Noh Jin-pyo

00:10:14.802 --> 00:10:18.222
has been handling client funds
through his personal account?

00:10:24.895 --> 00:10:27.690
So you just stood there and let him leave?

00:10:29.942 --> 00:10:33.571
I felt unwell, so I took some painkillers
and sleeping pills in the early hours.

00:10:33.654 --> 00:10:36.699
-I didn't know he had left.
-How sick could you have been?

00:10:39.452 --> 00:10:41.036
Even if you missed it that day,

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.914
why didn't you say something
once you realized he was gone?

00:10:45.833 --> 00:10:49.628
He'd sometimes leave for the weekend
without saying anything

00:10:49.712 --> 00:10:52.256
and head straight to work,
so I thought it was the same thing.

00:10:52.339 --> 00:10:53.883
You cooked yourself some eggs?

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.929
Here I am, so worried sick about Jin-pyo
that I can't even eat.

00:11:03.434 --> 00:11:04.268
My son.

00:11:06.562 --> 00:11:09.482
What's been weighing on you so heavily?

00:11:09.565 --> 00:11:10.900
Who did this to you?

00:11:30.878 --> 00:11:31.712
Are you even

00:11:32.963 --> 00:11:34.465
worried about him?

00:11:36.967 --> 00:11:40.262
It wasn't easy getting security footage
from Shanghai Airport.

00:11:40.346 --> 00:11:42.139
But, hey, what are friends for?

00:11:45.017 --> 00:11:46.185
No way.

00:11:49.814 --> 00:11:50.815
That kid.

00:11:58.656 --> 00:11:59.657
Shit.

00:12:01.992 --> 00:12:03.911
Just how many women did he have?

00:12:06.622 --> 00:12:08.499
What kind of life have you been leading?

00:12:11.502 --> 00:12:13.838
MOM

00:12:17.258 --> 00:12:18.092
Hello?

00:12:19.635 --> 00:12:20.636
Hui-su

00:12:22.054 --> 00:12:23.347
is unbelievable.

00:12:24.682 --> 00:12:26.100
No, she seems odd.

00:12:26.183 --> 00:12:30.437
I cried in front of her today,
and she didn't shed a single tear.

00:12:30.521 --> 00:12:33.899
Don't badger her for no reason.
Just give it some time.

00:12:35.401 --> 00:12:37.069
-Jin-pyo, he…
-He what?

00:12:38.863 --> 00:12:40.072
What about your brother?

00:12:40.155 --> 00:12:41.073
What is it?

00:12:43.701 --> 00:12:45.703
He chose to leave.
He'll return soon enough.

00:12:45.786 --> 00:12:47.538
When he's broke or comes around.

00:12:48.998 --> 00:12:50.457
Hey, Jin-young--

00:12:57.506 --> 00:12:58.507
Embezzlement?

00:12:59.633 --> 00:13:02.177
I showed Ms. Jo
his audit results yesterday.

00:13:10.019 --> 00:13:10.853
Wait,

00:13:11.478 --> 00:13:13.772
you're already done with the audit?

00:13:14.398 --> 00:13:17.192
Since credibility and trust
are paramount in this industry,

00:13:17.276 --> 00:13:21.030
we have a system in place
that allows specialized personnel

00:13:21.113 --> 00:13:24.491
to swiftly investigate
any instances of personal misconduct,

00:13:24.575 --> 00:13:26.827
such as that of Deputy Branch Manager Noh.

00:13:32.416 --> 00:13:34.919
AUDIT REPORT
NOH JIN-PYO EMBEZZLEMENT CASE

00:13:42.009 --> 00:13:43.886
DATES OF ENTRY AND EXIT

00:13:43.969 --> 00:13:47.222
Despite Mr. Noh's embezzlement
and subsequent departure,

00:13:47.723 --> 00:13:49.850
the company will not be pressing charges,

00:13:49.934 --> 00:13:54.021
opting instead to quietly resolve
the matter with suspension and dismissal.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.900
Please understand
that this leniency was granted

00:13:58.776 --> 00:14:00.194
after much deliberation.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.281
Could you please wait a little longer?

00:14:18.879 --> 00:14:19.713
Hello, ma'am.

00:14:22.466 --> 00:14:24.218
I'm here with the branch manager.

00:14:25.302 --> 00:14:26.804
Please excuse me.

00:14:27.972 --> 00:14:29.640
I heard you're with the police.

00:14:30.599 --> 00:14:32.726
You're Mr. Noh's sister, aren't you?

00:14:33.644 --> 00:14:35.771
I'm Mr. Noh's colleague An Myeong-ho.

00:14:38.023 --> 00:14:42.194
To me, some unusual details suggest that
this isn't a clear-cut embezzlement case.

00:14:42.861 --> 00:14:44.655
Since you're a police officer,

00:14:44.738 --> 00:14:47.950
I thought you could look into it yourself,
even if unofficially.

00:14:49.994 --> 00:14:51.704
Thank you. I'll look into it.

00:14:51.787 --> 00:14:53.998
-Let me know if I can help.
-Thanks.

00:15:10.305 --> 00:15:12.891
ALPHA INVESTMENT & SECURITIES CO, LTD.
AN MYEONG-HO

00:15:25.779 --> 00:15:27.281
Should I do as the company asks?

00:15:29.575 --> 00:15:30.951
Or what, make him a criminal?

00:15:32.411 --> 00:15:35.164
Whatever he was thinking,
he left evidence everywhere.

00:15:35.664 --> 00:15:39.001
If we provoke the company or the victim,
they could go to the cops.

00:15:39.752 --> 00:15:41.420
If that happens, he's done for.

00:15:42.087 --> 00:15:45.966
I can't stand how they act gracious
when they're just scrambling to save face.

00:15:46.925 --> 00:15:48.427
Still, they're letting it go,

00:15:49.928 --> 00:15:53.098
and the reality is that dragging this out
wouldn't help Jin-pyo.

00:15:55.559 --> 00:15:56.393
Okay.

00:15:57.311 --> 00:16:01.023
Hui-su, please don't do anything
that might get people talking.

00:16:01.523 --> 00:16:03.067
Avoid raising any suspicion.

00:16:05.027 --> 00:16:05.944
Suspicion?

00:16:06.028 --> 00:16:08.530
Your husband vanished
after committing fraud.

00:16:09.031 --> 00:16:11.116
So pursuing a divorce out of spite

00:16:11.825 --> 00:16:13.535
might make people suspicious.

00:16:14.244 --> 00:16:15.496
That maybe you conspired.

00:16:15.579 --> 00:16:16.705
I did no such thing.

00:16:16.789 --> 00:16:18.290
I believe you, of course.

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:22.711
Hui-su.

00:16:23.253 --> 00:16:24.588
Jin-pyo will be back soon.

00:16:26.006 --> 00:16:26.965
Of course.

00:16:29.676 --> 00:16:30.844
Are you okay getting home?

00:16:33.222 --> 00:16:34.848
Take care on your way back.

00:16:52.407 --> 00:16:53.492
Yes, hello.

00:16:53.992 --> 00:16:58.455
About the family screening consent form,
must I submit it by the end of today?

00:17:04.461 --> 00:17:05.295
Yes, Hui-su.

00:17:05.379 --> 00:17:06.713
It ended just now.

00:17:08.382 --> 00:17:09.633
Well done, Hui-su.

00:17:10.801 --> 00:17:13.053
I can't believe it's actually over.

00:17:14.138 --> 00:17:15.764
We're going to be fine now.

00:17:17.432 --> 00:17:18.267
Sure.

00:17:34.992 --> 00:17:37.995
MOM

00:18:05.522 --> 00:18:07.733
Gosh, it suits you perfectly, ma'am.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.742
I haven't worn something like this
in so long that I feel awkward.

00:18:19.453 --> 00:18:21.455
You look beautiful.

00:18:34.718 --> 00:18:36.345
I almost didn't recognize you.

00:18:36.845 --> 00:18:38.180
This is the new me.

00:18:39.264 --> 00:18:41.391
I said I'd treat you,
and this is what you pick?

00:18:41.475 --> 00:18:43.852
We came here often when we were younger.

00:18:43.936 --> 00:18:47.147
There are times
when I crave these tteokbokki.

00:18:47.731 --> 00:18:49.191
That's true. Let's go eat.

00:18:49.274 --> 00:18:51.693
-I'm buying everything from every vendor.
-Really?

00:18:52.986 --> 00:18:54.529
Then I'll order one of everything.

00:18:54.613 --> 00:18:57.074
Of course you will.
Let's stuff ourselves today.

00:19:46.248 --> 00:19:47.082
Hui-su?

00:19:49.251 --> 00:19:50.419
Want a cocktail?

00:19:58.427 --> 00:19:59.636
What was that?

00:20:02.931 --> 00:20:03.974
Where did it go?

00:21:51.415 --> 00:21:55.127
Just once, I want to see Mom beaming.

00:21:58.046 --> 00:21:58.880
What?

00:22:00.632 --> 00:22:03.176
You show up at the crack of dawn
to give me this?

00:22:03.927 --> 00:22:07.597
So what, you're giving me a hard time
about your mom not smiling now?

00:22:07.681 --> 00:22:09.599
I went through every photo with Mom,

00:22:09.683 --> 00:22:11.935
from kindergarten
to my college graduation,

00:22:12.018 --> 00:22:14.271
and she's not smiling in a single one.

00:22:14.896 --> 00:22:17.941
That alone shows
how you've hurt her for decades.

00:22:19.526 --> 00:22:23.822
If you're here to cause a scene
over nothing, I suggest you head back now.

00:22:23.905 --> 00:22:26.074
How can you possibly say this is nothing?

00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:29.619
Throughout my childhood, I…

00:22:29.703 --> 00:22:32.789
Even now,
what you've done still suffocates me.

00:22:33.623 --> 00:22:36.585
Mom and I lived in the hell you built.

00:22:36.668 --> 00:22:40.589
It's way too early for all this drivel
about hell, don't you think?

00:22:42.466 --> 00:22:45.093
Just don't come crying
when I'm long gone--

00:22:45.177 --> 00:22:46.428
I would never.

00:22:51.766 --> 00:22:53.351
Do you honestly think

00:22:54.603 --> 00:22:56.313
we'll grieve after you're gone?

00:23:03.069 --> 00:23:07.282
Lay a hand on Mom one more time
and I swear you'll never see me again.

00:23:07.782 --> 00:23:11.870
Nor will you see
Mom or Eun-hyeok ever again.

00:23:11.953 --> 00:23:13.497
I'll make sure of it.

00:24:14.391 --> 00:24:15.725
You can come out now.

00:24:34.452 --> 00:24:35.453
Eun-su.

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:40.292
Why are you here?

00:24:40.875 --> 00:24:41.710
Mom.

00:24:42.419 --> 00:24:45.046
When did you get here?
Is something going on?

00:24:47.132 --> 00:24:48.842
Let's get rid of this closet.

00:24:54.472 --> 00:24:55.432
What?

00:24:57.392 --> 00:24:59.102
I've always wanted to.

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:14.534
Okay. Let's throw it out.

00:25:16.578 --> 00:25:18.413
Let's take it out this instant.

00:25:32.886 --> 00:25:33.887
Well done,

00:25:35.388 --> 00:25:36.222
Eun-su.

00:26:47.627 --> 00:26:49.003
The doors are opening.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.348
You're looking pretty today.

00:27:00.849 --> 00:27:01.683
What?

00:27:04.811 --> 00:27:05.645
You too.

00:27:07.605 --> 00:27:08.606
I know.

00:27:15.613 --> 00:27:19.409
SANGAE NURSING HOME

00:27:20.785 --> 00:27:25.165
These days, I drink my coffee
in the floral teacup you bought me.

00:27:26.291 --> 00:27:29.502
Maybe that's why
it actually tastes like coffee now.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.465
Back then, I constantly had mouth sores,

00:27:34.132 --> 00:27:35.550
so even water tasted bitter.

00:27:36.885 --> 00:27:38.386
Now even water tastes good.

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:54.402
It's fine. It doesn't hurt anymore.

00:27:58.948 --> 00:28:00.575
How pretty, right?

00:28:02.744 --> 00:28:05.872
Let me finish this up quickly
so we can take a photo.

00:28:09.918 --> 00:28:11.211
I'm sorry, Ms. Kim.

00:28:11.961 --> 00:28:13.254
I'm truly sorry.

00:28:15.632 --> 00:28:17.634
I was compensated for the damages.

00:28:21.471 --> 00:28:24.724
I'm sure it's a small price to pay
to avoid losing me as a client.

00:28:25.892 --> 00:28:28.603
I was never worried about losing
such a small amount.

00:28:29.395 --> 00:28:33.525
All I cared about was hiding how big
my slush fund was from my husband.

00:28:34.275 --> 00:28:35.652
I'm glad it all worked out.

00:28:40.031 --> 00:28:41.533
I was anxious about that.

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.953
I'm glad everything
turned out well for her.

00:28:45.787 --> 00:28:47.622
I still feel terrible about it,

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.042
but I'm really glad
things worked out this way.

00:28:51.668 --> 00:28:52.502
Yeah.

00:28:56.548 --> 00:28:58.299
Doesn't this place have good soup?

00:29:04.138 --> 00:29:05.723
Why do you keep checking the time?

00:29:06.349 --> 00:29:07.892
Oh, it's nothing.

00:29:07.976 --> 00:29:09.644
-Oh dear.
-I'm sorry.

00:29:20.488 --> 00:29:23.533
It still feels like
he'll walk through the door any minute.

00:29:27.704 --> 00:29:28.705
Noh Jin-pyo?

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:31.624
Yes.

00:29:35.753 --> 00:29:38.298
How would you feel
about going back to work?

00:29:42.427 --> 00:29:43.970
I've been looking, actually.

00:29:44.053 --> 00:29:45.722
Good. The publisher you worked for--

00:29:45.805 --> 00:29:46.639
No.

00:29:48.308 --> 00:29:49.893
I want to work somewhere new,

00:29:50.518 --> 00:29:52.020
doing work I've never done,

00:29:52.562 --> 00:29:54.230
living an entirely new life.

00:30:04.741 --> 00:30:05.742
It's right ahead.

00:30:13.166 --> 00:30:15.752
-It's a busy area, so be careful.
-Okay.

00:30:23.468 --> 00:30:24.552
Watch out for the boxes.

00:30:47.659 --> 00:30:53.414
JINGANG CHINESE MARKET

00:30:59.837 --> 00:31:02.548
MISSED CALLS
MR. JIN SO-BAEK

00:31:04.384 --> 00:31:06.135
I missed two calls from him.

00:31:12.433 --> 00:31:17.105
RECRUITING WAREHOUSE STAFF
BEGINNERS WELCOME

00:31:26.072 --> 00:31:27.615
Hey, it's been a while.

00:31:28.199 --> 00:31:30.326
-It has.
-Hold on. I need to get these out.

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:32.328
Have you checked the order sheet?

00:31:32.412 --> 00:31:33.287
I have.

00:31:36.249 --> 00:31:39.460
-Could you move these to the side?
-On it, sir.

00:31:41.254 --> 00:31:43.673
Have another cup of coffee.
I'll get back to you soon.

00:31:56.602 --> 00:31:57.687
That's right.

00:31:57.770 --> 00:32:00.690
Nothing clears a foggy mind
like moving your body.

00:32:04.444 --> 00:32:05.653
Mr. Jin?

00:32:15.288 --> 00:32:19.292
RÉSUMÉ
JO HUI-SU

00:32:47.487 --> 00:32:50.364
Working at our market
means doing a lot of physical labor.

00:32:53.034 --> 00:32:55.453
Are those magical story-writing hands
up for it?

00:32:55.536 --> 00:32:58.456
Right, she's my friend
who's great with her hands.

00:33:01.042 --> 00:33:05.254
I tried lifting one of the outgoing boxes
while I was waiting. I can handle it.

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:08.633
I've moved large furniture
on my own before too.

00:33:09.967 --> 00:33:12.053
What work do you have in mind for her?

00:33:12.136 --> 00:33:14.097
Jang Kang suddenly quit, you see.

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:20.686
Do you remember him? My delivery guy.

00:33:25.858 --> 00:33:26.859
Right, yes.

00:33:28.861 --> 00:33:29.987
He went back home.

00:33:33.866 --> 00:33:35.159
I see.

00:33:45.211 --> 00:33:46.212
Let's see.

00:33:48.047 --> 00:33:51.092
There just happens to be an opening
that covers everything

00:33:51.175 --> 00:33:54.095
from managing display shelves
to packing deliveries.

00:34:01.519 --> 00:34:03.813
You wouldn't be typing at a desk.

00:34:03.896 --> 00:34:05.606
Are you sure you're up for it?

00:34:08.067 --> 00:34:09.485
That sounds even better.

00:34:09.569 --> 00:34:11.988
Does your husband know
you want a job here?

00:34:13.906 --> 00:34:15.283
You seem to be married.

00:34:18.703 --> 00:34:19.537
Right, well--

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:20.955
We're currently separated.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:29.422
You may need to work overtime.

00:34:31.007 --> 00:34:32.675
I could stay late every day.

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:50.359
We'll start with a one-month trial.
Ask the woman out front about pay.

00:34:52.737 --> 00:34:53.988
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

00:34:54.071 --> 00:34:55.239
Thank you, sir.

00:35:04.999 --> 00:35:06.918
UNIT 1501
CALL

00:35:50.127 --> 00:35:51.545
Wear this on your first day.

00:35:51.629 --> 00:35:54.298
You'll feel full of energy,
like the old Hui-su.

00:35:57.468 --> 00:35:58.469
Thanks.

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:20.366
Going somewhere, ma'am?

00:36:21.117 --> 00:36:21.951
Yes.

00:36:23.536 --> 00:36:24.787
Have a great day.

00:36:38.634 --> 00:36:41.137
November 10th.

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:45.141
Brown jacket, jeans,

00:36:45.808 --> 00:36:46.809
lipstick,

00:36:48.102 --> 00:36:49.145
and a purse.

00:36:49.979 --> 00:36:53.232
For the Black Prestige customer event
in the first quarter of next year,

00:36:53.316 --> 00:36:55.901
we plan to expand
the small-scale workshops…

00:36:59.822 --> 00:37:02.908
Excuse me. …with industry experts.

00:37:06.746 --> 00:37:09.623
Get it. One of our clients may be calling.

00:37:10.624 --> 00:37:12.126
Right. Yes, sir.

00:37:13.252 --> 00:37:14.420
Hello?

00:37:15.046 --> 00:37:16.964
Is this Ms. Jo Eun-su speaking?

00:37:17.048 --> 00:37:18.174
Yes, this is she.

00:37:18.257 --> 00:37:20.676
I'm calling from Yongsan Police Station.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.094
Do you have a minute to…

00:37:23.095 --> 00:37:24.221
The police station?

00:37:28.517 --> 00:37:29.643
Please excuse me.

00:37:30.227 --> 00:37:31.228
Sure.

00:37:33.647 --> 00:37:36.692
Mr. Kwon Seong-cheol
even sued the journalist

00:37:36.776 --> 00:37:40.446
who reported that his wife's death
was a suicide caused by domestic violence.

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:43.699
But she was

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:46.243
a victim of domestic violence.

00:37:46.327 --> 00:37:49.663
Are you saying you'll go
to the police station to testify?

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:56.170
I hear the police want you to testify

00:37:56.253 --> 00:37:59.423
because you were the last person
she met, aside from her family,

00:37:59.507 --> 00:38:01.675
before she passed.

00:38:02.176 --> 00:38:03.719
You should think carefully.

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:06.472
Do you know how much
Mr. Kwon spends at our…

00:38:06.555 --> 00:38:08.099
We don't even need to go that far.

00:38:08.599 --> 00:38:11.185
You have a better understanding than I do

00:38:11.268 --> 00:38:14.939
of his impact on our VIP sales team's
performance and survival.

00:38:15.022 --> 00:38:16.148
Mr. Park, even so--

00:38:16.232 --> 00:38:17.900
You turned a blind eye that day.

00:38:18.484 --> 00:38:21.153
Now we're here, just say,
"I don't know. It's not true."

00:38:29.912 --> 00:38:31.664
You'll say, "I didn't see any bruises."

00:38:32.748 --> 00:38:34.875
"Mrs. Kang didn't mention anything."

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:37.211
Right?

00:38:50.641 --> 00:38:51.684
Good evening, ma'am.

00:38:56.397 --> 00:38:57.481
Hello.

00:38:57.565 --> 00:38:59.817
Mr. Kwon would like to show
his appreciation.

00:39:03.612 --> 00:39:05.573
What have I done to earn his appreciation?

00:39:07.533 --> 00:39:09.410
I can't accept this. Please take it back.

00:39:09.493 --> 00:39:10.619
You should take it.

00:39:21.755 --> 00:39:22.756
Excuse me!

00:39:42.318 --> 00:39:43.527
You're still here?

00:39:45.404 --> 00:39:47.698
I thought you had already left, sir.

00:39:49.283 --> 00:39:50.159
I forgot something.

00:39:51.035 --> 00:39:51.869
Right.

00:40:20.105 --> 00:40:21.232
Go home already.

00:40:22.149 --> 00:40:24.151
I'll just finish up what I was doing.

00:40:24.652 --> 00:40:26.487
Anything I can do for you, sir?

00:40:28.864 --> 00:40:30.950
Jingang doesn't have
an executive board system.

00:40:32.243 --> 00:40:33.077
Sorry?

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.287
Eun-su said her goal
was to become an executive.

00:40:35.788 --> 00:40:38.040
I thought you might be ambitious,
like your friend.

00:40:38.916 --> 00:40:40.292
What's wrong with this?

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:43.003
I'm not.

00:40:51.554 --> 00:40:53.055
Mr. Jin, you're still here.

00:40:53.556 --> 00:40:56.016
We're having dinner together.
Would you care to join us?

00:40:57.309 --> 00:40:58.602
Speak of the devil.

00:41:00.563 --> 00:41:01.480
Let's go.

00:41:03.816 --> 00:41:05.442
Let me just grab my jacket.

00:41:10.447 --> 00:41:13.617
My client tells me
that this place is a must-try.

00:41:17.496 --> 00:41:19.999
Eat up. Help yourself, sir.

00:41:25.754 --> 00:41:28.215
Eun-su, it's not even cooked yet.

00:41:31.051 --> 00:41:33.679
I guess I got impatient
because I'm starving.

00:41:38.559 --> 00:41:39.810
Excuse me.

00:41:40.686 --> 00:41:41.937
Could we get more garlic…

00:41:45.524 --> 00:41:47.234
Give it time. We'll hear back.

00:42:08.881 --> 00:42:10.633
Excuse me, I need to use the restroom.

00:42:16.263 --> 00:42:17.264
Don't avoid it.

00:42:21.226 --> 00:42:22.061
Mr. Kwon.

00:42:24.271 --> 00:42:25.939
This is the women's restroom.

00:42:26.023 --> 00:42:28.150
I know. My assistant's keeping an eye out.

00:42:35.407 --> 00:42:37.368
If this is about Mrs. Kang…

00:42:39.453 --> 00:42:41.413
We should let the dead rest in dignity.

00:42:42.998 --> 00:42:45.417
"Suicide caused by domestic violence."

00:42:48.545 --> 00:42:49.630
Ms. Jo,

00:42:50.798 --> 00:42:52.800
you've known both of us
for quite some time.

00:42:54.468 --> 00:42:55.886
Turning a blind eye

00:42:57.388 --> 00:42:58.639
to Mrs. Kang that day…

00:42:59.348 --> 00:43:00.891
I've regretted it ever since.

00:43:04.645 --> 00:43:05.562
So…

00:43:07.648 --> 00:43:10.776
you want to do something
you'll regret even more?

00:43:13.404 --> 00:43:15.114
And ignore my gesture of gratitude?

00:43:16.782 --> 00:43:20.285
Tomorrow, I plan to testify about
everything I saw at the police station.

00:43:31.839 --> 00:43:33.424
I will also testify about this.

00:43:39.847 --> 00:43:41.098
Why, you damn…

00:43:51.942 --> 00:43:52.776
Shit.

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:54.737
Wait, who are you? What the heck?

00:43:55.738 --> 00:43:56.572
Mr. Jin!

00:44:07.583 --> 00:44:09.460
I just caught you in the act.

00:44:10.335 --> 00:44:11.587
Who are you--

00:44:12.379 --> 00:44:13.464
Please don't.

00:44:15.007 --> 00:44:18.218
Unless you're ready to close up shop,
let's settle this quietly, okay?

00:44:20.012 --> 00:44:21.972
Yes. I understand, sir.

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:25.976
Eun-su.

00:44:26.059 --> 00:44:27.770
Mr. Jin, please don't.

00:44:31.023 --> 00:44:32.441
-Are you okay?
-You good?

00:44:38.739 --> 00:44:39.740
Hold on.

00:44:40.949 --> 00:44:42.618
It's always been that asshole.

00:44:42.701 --> 00:44:46.163
I missed out on hangover soup
and barbecue, thanks to that motherfucker.

00:44:50.167 --> 00:44:51.752
Thank you for helping me.

00:44:51.835 --> 00:44:54.630
You'd always be welcome
to join us here at Jingang.

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:09.102
What now?

00:45:09.812 --> 00:45:11.730
What do you want to do? Talk to me.

00:45:15.317 --> 00:45:16.777
I want to put an end to this.

00:45:17.528 --> 00:45:18.946
You mean you'll testify?

00:45:19.029 --> 00:45:21.365
What if it puts you in danger again?

00:45:29.331 --> 00:45:30.499
All right, fine.

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:34.586
Go for it. Might as well give it a try.

00:45:36.922 --> 00:45:37.798
But still…

00:45:39.675 --> 00:45:40.843
I'll be fine now.

00:45:51.812 --> 00:45:53.814
You must've had a hard time on your own.

00:45:58.694 --> 00:46:00.153
On top of that, I…

00:46:03.949 --> 00:46:05.242
It's not like that.

00:46:12.958 --> 00:46:14.418
Why would you think that?

00:46:14.501 --> 00:46:16.128
I'm being so silly.

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.464
This is just the kind of day
for some clattering.

00:46:26.972 --> 00:46:27.806
Watch this.

00:46:35.063 --> 00:46:35.898
What?

00:46:40.277 --> 00:46:41.236
Want a go?

00:47:20.025 --> 00:47:21.276
So your hands are magic.

00:47:23.445 --> 00:47:26.365
This sound somehow really eases my mind.

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:31.119
Did Jingang just gain a star employee?

00:47:45.801 --> 00:47:47.260
Why can't I do it?

00:47:48.053 --> 00:47:49.721
May I clean up the other tables?

00:47:49.805 --> 00:47:51.431
Thank you for your service.

00:47:58.146 --> 00:48:01.566
Jang Kang quitting out of the blue
left us understaffed.

00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:05.612
Hui-su won't quit
out of the blue, will she?

00:48:08.115 --> 00:48:09.116
Of course not.

00:48:09.866 --> 00:48:11.201
Would you like some water?

00:48:15.956 --> 00:48:19.501
The date was wrong on this
the last time I came, and it still is.

00:48:19.584 --> 00:48:20.836
Hands off.

00:48:24.673 --> 00:48:25.507
Okay.

00:48:33.432 --> 00:48:34.433
Don't touch it.

00:48:37.019 --> 00:48:38.687
It's when my son was born and died.

00:48:42.482 --> 00:48:43.483
Hey, go home.

00:48:46.695 --> 00:48:49.239
Leave and clean up tomorrow.
I'm turning off the lights.

00:49:08.133 --> 00:49:10.510
I also remember the day I lost my child.

00:49:29.446 --> 00:49:30.822
It must have been hard.

00:49:36.203 --> 00:49:37.245
For both of us.

00:49:52.385 --> 00:49:53.595
Clatter.

00:49:57.182 --> 00:49:58.266
Clatter.

00:50:02.896 --> 00:50:04.022
Clatter.

00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:31.383
Let's go.

00:50:41.059 --> 00:50:45.730
INTERVIEW ROOM, VISITATION ROOM

00:50:45.814 --> 00:50:46.940
Shall we begin?

00:50:48.775 --> 00:50:49.651
Yes.

00:50:56.658 --> 00:50:58.910
-I'll order. You can find a seat.
-Yes, ma'am.

00:51:09.588 --> 00:51:10.422
What is this?

00:51:10.964 --> 00:51:11.798
What's what?

00:51:13.717 --> 00:51:16.386
-Ms. Jo didn't get the promotion.
-What?

00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:19.472
The victim is believed
to have taken her own life

00:51:19.556 --> 00:51:21.099
due to prolonged domestic abuse.

00:51:21.183 --> 00:51:22.350
For real?

00:51:22.434 --> 00:51:24.269
Reporter Lee Jae-hyeon has the details.

00:51:24.936 --> 00:51:28.565
The incident was nearly dismissed
as a simple pedestrian accident,

00:51:28.648 --> 00:51:31.651
a claim consistently maintained
by the victim's husband, Kwon.

00:51:31.735 --> 00:51:33.653
VIP SALES TEAM
PROMOTION NOTICE

00:51:33.737 --> 00:51:37.324
However, the case took a dramatic turn
when a new testimony emerged.

00:51:37.824 --> 00:51:41.328
An acquaintance of the couple
alleged that the victim's husband,

00:51:41.411 --> 00:51:45.874
who had claimed it was a simple accident,
had been abusive for years.

00:51:46.374 --> 00:51:48.210
Police are now reinvestigating the case

00:51:48.293 --> 00:51:50.253
as a potential suicide
driven by domestic violence.

00:51:50.337 --> 00:51:52.589
TESTIMONY OF DEPARTMENT STORE STAFF

00:51:52.672 --> 00:51:54.382
The bereaved family
is demanding legal action

00:51:54.466 --> 00:51:57.052
against the deceased's husband.

00:51:58.053 --> 00:52:01.473
An employee at a department store
the victim had frequented…

00:52:01.556 --> 00:52:03.058
-Mom.
-Yeah?

00:52:03.141 --> 00:52:06.478
That Mr. Dickhead upstairs.
He hasn't been around lately, has he?

00:52:07.062 --> 00:52:09.189
Come on, you can't call people that.

00:52:10.357 --> 00:52:12.859
That's me being super respectful.

00:52:13.652 --> 00:52:15.070
He's been MIA lately, right?

00:52:18.114 --> 00:52:19.574
He must've gone somewhere.

00:52:26.831 --> 00:52:29.793
These beets just came in today.
They're very fresh.

00:52:30.961 --> 00:52:33.630
-I see.
-Take them. I'll give you a good deal.

00:52:34.756 --> 00:52:37.050
I won't be buying beets anymore.

00:54:49.724 --> 00:54:50.892
I'm home.

00:55:00.151 --> 00:55:02.237
To strengthen your data skills
and boost efficiency…

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:04.072
LAVIE DEPARTMENT STORE 2025
TRAINING WORKSHOP

00:55:04.155 --> 00:55:07.742
…you must first address
the pressing new issues.

00:55:07.826 --> 00:55:09.452
Even now, all of you are actively…

00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:15.101
I'm sorry.

00:56:31.409 --> 00:56:33.119
Hey, Hui-su. Everything okay?

00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:35.205
With me?

00:56:35.705 --> 00:56:36.789
Of course.

00:56:39.459 --> 00:56:41.753
I just stepped out
to go to the convenience store.

00:56:43.004 --> 00:56:44.464
Are you done with your workshop?

00:56:45.048 --> 00:56:46.883
There's one session left to go.

00:56:47.592 --> 00:56:49.302
Three days of training sure is tough.

00:56:50.345 --> 00:56:52.055
You must be so exhausted.

00:56:52.138 --> 00:56:53.765
It'll be over by tomorrow morning.

00:56:54.265 --> 00:56:56.226
I'll go straight to work from here, and…

00:56:57.310 --> 00:56:58.311
Hold on.

00:57:06.694 --> 00:57:09.572
I keep getting calls
from an unknown number.

00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:12.784
I can get off work early
tomorrow afternoon.

00:57:13.284 --> 00:57:14.869
Let's go eat something tasty.

00:57:16.037 --> 00:57:17.372
Okay.

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:20.291
Don't doze off, okay?

00:57:23.586 --> 00:57:25.421
Black coat.

00:57:26.422 --> 00:57:29.592
Went out again despite the rain.

00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:32.971
Smiled as she was

00:57:34.264 --> 00:57:35.515
on the phone.

00:58:22.979 --> 00:58:23.980
Who are you?

01:01:36.339 --> 01:01:41.344
