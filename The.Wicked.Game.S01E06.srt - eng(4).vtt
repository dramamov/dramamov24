Who's here, Pheem?

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:07.670
Are you Team?

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.100
Don't leave me, Than.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:12.920
I found Wut.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.780
Good.
Then we can make him testify against Chet.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.770
This time,
we'll definitely take down Chet.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.970

Dad!

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:44.620
Dad, listen to me!

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.220
Dad!

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.820
Dad!

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.570
What's going on?

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.670
Didn't you say you would
wait for the investor from my side?

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.800
But you partnered with Pheem instead!

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.920
Five years ago,

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.370
it was me who secretly took the Fentanyl
from the hospital

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.460
and gave it to Mr. Chet
to sell to his friends.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.770
It's not true, Dad. It's not true!

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.470
Pheem must have forced Wut to say that!

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.950
Park, go bring Pheem here! Go!

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.270
Chet! Stop lying.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.150
You did all of it.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.130
Dad, this matter is over.
Just let Wut take the blame!

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.170
You are not the one
who I believe can make Thanavej better.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.700
Pheem will take full control
of the supervision on this project.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.960
Dad, no! I don't agree!

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.700
Dad!

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.220
You know clearly Jason has ill intentions
towards our company! And Pheem too!

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.200
You sent Pheem to Singapore
when he was little!

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.800
You didn't raise him.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.620
Do you think he will love you
and love our Thanavej?

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.100
It's me! It should be me!

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.550
Everything I did was for you
and our Thanavej!

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.630
Are you suggesting I'm a bad father
who doesn't raise his child?

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.920
I had to send him far away

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.270
precisely because you and your mother
incessantly caused trouble!

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.330
If your mother wasn't so narrow-minded

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.720
and didn't spend all her time
harassing Pheem and his mother,

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.470
I wouldn't have had to send him
to Singapore!

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.470
If you only loved her,

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.220
would she have done that?

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.020
How dare you talk to me like that?

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.200
Huh? Huh? Huh?

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.450
You think you're something, huh?

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.620
You think you're something, huh?

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.100
How dare you talk to me like that?

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.770
Huh?

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.070
You're just as impulsive and hot-tempered
as your mother!

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.070
But even though she was hot-tempered,
at least she had some brains!

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.370
You have nothing!

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.870
Lunatic! Fool!

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.150
Have you ever thought
about your drug selling?

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:03.900
If it gets exposed,

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.120
how much damage
would it cause to Thanavej?

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.650
Huh?

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.620
And a guy like you—you only have
the connections your mother left you.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.820
But you've never been able
to create anything on your own!

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.100
Pheem has nothing,

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.000
yet he can still defeat you!

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.150
A guy like you—
you want to take over Thanavej from me?

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:22.220

Give me a chance, okay, Dad?
Give me a chance, okay?

I won't do that again!

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.820
Dad, I won't do that again!

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.030
In the past, I sent Pheem to Singapore
to protect him.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.880
But today,
I will protect you in the same way.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.900
Go to Da Nang.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.320
Don't let me see you again.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.500

Dad, I'm begging you!

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.520
I'm begging you, Dad. I'm begging you.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.620
-Get out!
-I'm not going, Dad!

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.800
-Let's go, Mr. Chet.
-Dad!

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.670
-Please leave first.
-Let go!

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:10.270

I won't go to that branch office! Dad!

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.280
I know I haven't been able
to satisfy you yet, Dad!

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.670
Dad, don't do this to me!

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.920
Dad!

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:28.950

-Mr. Chet.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.260
Calm down first, Mr. Chet.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.110
We'll figure something out later,
Mr. Chet.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.570
Let's have a drink to celebrate, Than.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.000
We finally brought Chet down.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.280
I don't understand.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.100
We haven't found Wut
to be our witness yet.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.250
Why was your father willing
to sign with Jason?

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.820
Didn't we agree to find Wut
to deal with Chet first?

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.050
The other investors
must have pressured my father.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.560
So he compromised.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.600
Why overthink it?

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.180
At least we took down Chet.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.470
But no matter what, we must find Wut

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.900
and have him
testify about Chet's drug selling

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.360
and about Chet framing me.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.659
Only then can I get my police status back.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.870
Mm. Okay.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.270
Here, let me pour you a drink.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:09.510
Don't worry, Than.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.550
I'll handle it.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:19.770
Mm.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.680
Split up and keep looking.
You go that way.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.170
What's wrong, Risa? You found Wut?

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.550
Confess.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.950
I heard you have a wife and a child,
don't you?

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.050
If you confess,
you can go back to see them sooner.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:16.850
Confess.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.200
It was me who secretly took the Fentanyl
from the hospital

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.980
and gave it to Mr. Chet
to sell to his friends.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:29.900
What do you want?

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.000
You know very well that I know about this.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.300
But others don't know, right, Dad?

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:42.450
This video will be given to the police.
Then everyone will know.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.250
By that time, I'd also like to know

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:48.300
if you can still turn a blind eye.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.830
Are you threatening me, Pheem?

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.400
Don't you want to know
how far someone like me can go?

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.670
Truly my son.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.430
Proceed as planned.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:45.600
The documents.

Jason demands to change the contractor
to his own people.
[Matters Regarding Change of Contractor
for the Wellness Center Project]

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.620
He probably planned
to launder money from the project's start.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.950
He also converted cash to cryptocurrency

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.300
and spread rumors
to suppress the stock price.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.700
No matter how you look at it,
he's definitely up to something.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.020
So? Your old flame—

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.500
soon, he'll find a way
to swallow our entire hospital.

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.680
I have a plan ready to deal with him.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:15.270
I have a bargaining chip
to negotiate with him.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.020
Pheem, tell me if you need my help.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.650
I hope so.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:25.870
Don't let me down.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.820
Okay, Dad.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:32.500
I won't let you down.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:34.820
Humph.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.170
Dad, I want to talk to you.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.420
Why is he still here?

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:50.170
I've booked a ticket.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.320
But the accommodation arrangements
for Mr. Chet in Da Nang

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.720
will be finalized later.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:53.720
Dad, listen to me.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.420
I'm busy.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:55.650
Dad, listen to me first.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:56.220
I'm busy!

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.270
Dad, listen to me first! Dad! Dad!

00:11:58.770 --> 00:11:59.450
Dad!

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.420
What are you laughing at?

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.920
I know you forced Wut to say those things.

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:12.470
But what Wut said is the truth.

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.800
You were indeed the one
who sold the drugs.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:19.420
Chet, there's nothing you can do now.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:20.820
Go to Da Nang.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.100
You children of mistresses,
don't think it's over just like this!

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.420
Thanavej is mine! It's mine!

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:33.520
Sorry, Chet, I don't have time
to listen to your complaints.

I still can't figure out where Wut is.

If I can't find Wut,
what evidence can I give

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.890
to the new director to prove I was framed?

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.860
Do you want more, Brother?

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.800
Excuse me, Chairman.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:31.820
Chairman.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:33.950
You have an urgent call.

Are you sure?

Chairman, Mr. Pheem is here.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.700
Dad, you asked to see us.
What's the matter?

I heard Jason plans to deal with you

and then take all your shares.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.320
Really, Dad?

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.900
He surely knows what you're capable of.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.700
He's afraid you might bite back.

Do what you have to do.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.820
Just make sure it doesn't affect Thanavej.

Okay, Dad.

with your own people?

You're taking care of everything
from start to finish?

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:15.599
Since I'm the investor,
I have the right to reap the profits.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.220
You know I care about profit
more than anything.

for a little longer.

You surprised me again, Jason.

But I'm glad you're doing this yourself.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:45.220
Better than hiring those
incompetent hitmen to deal with me.

works very efficiently.

You knew long ago, yet you were
still willing to come with me.

Do you have any other plans?

What plans could I have?

Knowing my death date
is quite interesting.

still being able to control it...

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:18.710

I'll have no one left.

Pheem.

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.080
I promised you

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:23.290
I'd always be with you,

you're very cute.

I'm not a puppy, but I'll be a ghost.

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:28.489
I'll follow you everywhere, inseparable.

No.

without harming the hospital's reputation.

If something's bothering you, tell me.

if I still want to go back to running it.

What's wrong?

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:50.260
On one hand, I still want to go back
to being a police officer.

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:52.520
Boss is also helping me investigate Wut.

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:57.340

It couldn't be anyone else.

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.540
I think running a shop is pretty good too.

Let's wait on that.
We'll talk about it later.

Don't overthink it, Than.

I gave him a chance.

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:19.010
But he just refused to tell me.

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:20.680
So you're just letting it be?

00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:24.390
Right now,
things between me and Pheem are good.

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:30.530
He doesn't want to lose me,
just like I don't want to lose him.

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:38.590
Maybe I should just turn a blind eye
and pretend I didn't see it.

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:41.980
Let the shop trashing incident go.

00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:43.970
Than,

00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:47.580
how long can a person turn a blind eye?

00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:52.760
Than! Than!

00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:54.090
Come and look at this!

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:55.400
What is it?

00:48:58.100 --> 00:48:58.240
[Mysterious Body Found
in Canal Behind Village]

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.800
This morning,
a villager reported to the police

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:03.610
that he saw something floating up
in the canal behind the village.

00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:04.820
So he called the police.

00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:07.260
When the police arrived at the scene,
they found a male corpse.

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:10.450
The deceased was later identified
as Natthawut Sakunyot.

00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:12.450
The police preliminarily suspect

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:15.780
the cause of death might be
an accident due to drunk driving.

00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:30.090
Than.

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.620
You saw the news, right?

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:35.760
I saw it, Than.

00:49:39.850 --> 00:49:41.780
You didn't know about this, right?

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.360
No, Than.

00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:46.410
From the day Wut disappeared,

00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:50.310
I sent people to look for him,
but we never found him.

00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:55.370
But I think it must be Chet who did it.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.800
Because he benefited from this.

00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:00.500
He can cover up the truth
about the Fentanyl case.

00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:03.360
And it can prevent you
from going back to being a cop.

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:12.040
Mm.

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:14.810
I think so too.

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:22.370
Let's go, Than.
Let's get ready, or we'll be late.

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.340
Where are we going?

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:26.640
The shareholders' banquet.

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:30.060
The one we talked about a few days ago.
Have you forgotten?

00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:34.440
No. I'm just not feeling very well, Pheem.

00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:35.960
Can you go by yourself?

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:38.810
Are you unwell?

00:50:39.610 --> 00:50:41.270
Do you want me to stay with you?

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:43.130
It's okay, Pheem.

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:46.620
I'll be fine after getting some rest.

00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:47.870
Are you sure?

00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:50.210
Mm.

00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:53.250
Go ahead. I'll be fine.

00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:00.050
I'll be back soon.

00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:00.740
Mm.

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:21.490
Here.

00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:37.550
What are you doing here?

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:38.720
Get out.

00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:41.380
I told you to get out!

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:41.900
Park!

00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:44.040
Let him go.

00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:53.120
I knew you'd come.

00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:57.000
Did you kill Wut?

00:51:58.970 --> 00:52:00.050
Are you blind?

00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:02.610
Can't you see how I am now?

00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:06.500
Who can I possibly kill like this?

00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:10.940
It could be your subordinates.

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:16.690
What are you laughing at?

00:52:16.690 --> 00:52:17.820
I'm laughing at you.

00:52:19.170 --> 00:52:20.810
Haven't you realized it yet?

00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:23.740
Who is really behind this whole thing?

00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:28.190
It's the person
who sleeps next to you every day.

00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:31.000
You can't just frame someone randomly,
Chet.

00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:37.090
Ask yourself. Do you really believe it?

00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:40.240
A crazy woman like Veerin

00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:43.500
would inexplicably appear at the dock
where Jason was?

00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:48.020
You mean
all of this was designed by Pheem?

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:49.680
Have you eaten fish recently?

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.600
Your brain is finally working a little.

00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:54.740
Whether it's Surasak or Wut,

00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:57.100
it was all Pheem's doing.

00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:59.000
Do you know

00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:02.050
why I was sent to Da Nang?

00:53:02.650 --> 00:53:03.650
Because of Pheem.

00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:08.610
He showed my father the video of Wut
saying me involved in the Fentanyl case.

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:11.280
Pheem caught Wut?

00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:12.760
Of course.

00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:15.700
Otherwise,
I wouldn't have ended up like this.

00:53:16.090 --> 00:53:18.540
Do you still think Pheem is a good person?

00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:23.840
Pheem is worse than me.

00:53:32.290 --> 00:53:33.620
If you don't believe me,

00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:35.980
go look for it yourself.

00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:41.060
Someone like Pheem
definitely keeps evidence.

00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:38.530
I heard you have a wife and a child,
don't you?

00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:43.040
If you confess,
you can go back to see them sooner.

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:48.450
Hurry up!

00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:51.040
Five years ago,

00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:56.320
it was me who secretly took the Fentanyl
from the hospital

00:55:57.690 --> 00:56:00.150
and gave it to Mr. Chet
to sell to his friends.

00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:02.180
And 2 years ago,

00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:04.780
a friend of Mr. Chet's was arrested.

00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:06.620
The matter was about to be exposed.

00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:07.810
So Mr. Chet stopped.

00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:12.060
Then...
the police tracked it down to Mr. Chet.

00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:16.100
So Mr. Chet hired someone
to frame the cop in charge of the case,

00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:17.630
saying he accepted bribes!

00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:19.400
The evidence is conclusive.

00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:21.500
Do you have anything else to say?

00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:24.240
The money isn't mine. I didn't do it.

00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:34.610
Help! I don't want to die yet!

00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:35.670
What are you doing?

00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:04.530
[In the Next Episode]

00:57:04.530 --> 00:57:06.120
Pheem is keeping Than by his side.

00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:07.520
That's enough to prove it, Dad.

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:10.920
Pheem isn't decisive enough
to take over or manage Thanavej.

00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:14.450
Pheem!

00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:16.140
I have nothing left.

00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:18.470
But you... still have friends and family.

00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:19.050
Go back.

00:57:19.050 --> 00:57:20.330
Even though I have, I'll stay with you.

00:57:20.330 --> 00:57:23.180
I know how hard you've fought
to get to this point.

00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:25.940
This will be the final test to see if you

00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:28.010
truly deserve to be the successor.

00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:30.120
The bad guys must be punished.

00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:31.300
Are you insane?

00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:32.920
If you do this, Thanavej will be finished!

00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:35.280
I've fought so hard
just to get to this point.

00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:37.540
Then there's nothing left to say, Pheem.

00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:39.200
If you leave, I'll shoot.
