Twist your body more.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:34.940
Look at your opponent's face.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.310
Punch.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.240
Hold on.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.140
Can't you stop smoking?

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.040
I stink.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.640
If you don't like it, just go back.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.290
It's not good for your health.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.320
My health or yours?

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.150
Your health!

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.170
Ouch, I have a cramp!

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.360
- What's wrong?
- I have a cramp!

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.990
Come on, stretch.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.360
Stretch it out.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.880
Properly.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.540
- It's hurt!
- Do you feel better?

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.360
Flex your calf.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.600
Okay.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.810
Stay there.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.580
It's hurt!

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:29.690
My cramp!

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.290
I told you to stretch before practice, didn't I?

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.660
My cramp!

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.680
Ouch!

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.010
What about my cramp!?

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.350
Help me first!

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.310
Good.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.850
Up in the sky.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:49.380
Up!

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.270
Good. Stay.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.220
Nom.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.800
I'll right back.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.050
Yes!

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.000
Hey, dude! Hello!

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.580
Why did you come here?

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.350
You hang out at my house often as soon as you found out where I live.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.770
I was worried you'd be lonely. You live alone, don't you?

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.190
That's why I'm here.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.470
Am I lonely or are you lonely?

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.050
It's you.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.440
Hey. Hey.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.950
This is my house.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.000
I haven't allowed you to come in yet.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.850
It's alright, I don't mind.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.840
Come on!

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.660
Let's go.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.880
I'm the one who should mind.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:49.930
Just go.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.210
Go ahead, make yourself at home.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.210
I'm the one who should be inviting you in.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.290
Welcome.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.010
Yummy!

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.410
Where did you buy it?

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.090
I didn't buy it.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.510
I made it myself.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.630
Unbelievable.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.690
Are you bragging?

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.050
Huh?

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.010
I'm not bragging.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.110
I made it myself.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.020
Even though it's not very good, I won't brag to you!

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.840
Give it back, don't eat it!

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.470
I put so much effort. (dialect)

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.950
Say what?

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.370
I put so much effort.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.390
Don't eat it then!

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.930
Alright.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.470
I'm just kidding.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.530
It's yummy.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.020
So yummy.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.580
Uh.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.170
You're not doing deliveries today?

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.390
I didn't stop working.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.760
I'll be heading out for deliveries in a bit.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.010
Over there.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.680
The house spirits.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.840
I told them to take care of the house.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.540
Seriously?

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.830
It's my day off.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.660
Can't you see that I'm free and chatting with you here?

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.900
You're talkative today.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.290
And cracking jokes too.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.620
Just say I'm not working today,

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.720
that's enough!

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:21.940
Why are you rambling so much?

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.650
So, what are you going to do today if you're not working?

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.630
I plan to give Khai Jiao a bath.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.400
She's starting to get stinky.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.320
Really?

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:33.390
Hey.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.770
I'll help you. I'm free today.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:37.220
It's fine.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.580
Huh!?

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.640
I'll help you! I'm free today.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:41.400
Okay?

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.100
No.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.770
I'll help you. I'm totally free today.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:45.260
Okay?

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.710
You don't have to.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.610
I'll help you!

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.410
No.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.390
Khai Jiao's about to get a bath~

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.060
Oh, wrong one?

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:22.580
Khai Jiao.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.080
Yim.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.910
Yim.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:35.600
Umm.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.730
You're awake?

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.150
I was just about to wake you up.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.970
It's evening now, you can go home.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.750
Your place is so comfy.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:53.930
Can I keep sleeping?

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:55.520
No.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.150
I'm just teasing, why are you taking it so seriously?

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.330
I'm gonna borrow your shirt and pants for now, okay?

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:18.630
I'll wash them and give them back to you later.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.280
Yeah.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.290
You can give them back to me later.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.980
Thank you. Bye.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.700
Yim.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:28.590
Huh?

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.160
What?

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.260
Next time, you can sleep over here.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.290
You said it!

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.040
Don't be blaming me later.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.450
Mark it.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:43.770
Bye. See you.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:44.650
Yeah.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.150
Come whenever you want.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.020
Okay.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.480
Bye.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:53.150
Get home safe.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:08.810
Hey.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:11.760
Here you are.

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:22.530
Here.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:24.030
This is yours.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.260
Drink something sweet. It will give you some energy.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:28.800
What?

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:29.800
I didn't order it.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:31.340
No thanks.

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.480
Then don't take it.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.690
Just kidding.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.700
I don't want to hurt your feelings since you got it for me.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:42.620
Thank you.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.170
See you this evening.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.050
YES!

00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:58.650
Left, right.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.920
Left, right. Dodge!

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:03.570
1, 2 Dodge!

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.200
Okay.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:19.300
Straight punch.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.810
Left, right. Dodge!

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.470
Left, right. Dodge!

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:31.210
Knee!

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.570
Nice.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:44.080
Go for it!

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.030
Come on.

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:48.190
Left, right.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:49.520
Left, right.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.060
One more time.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:51.810
Left, right.

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:53.160
Left, right. Knee!

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:54.770
Nice.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:56.850
Hey, wait.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:58.280
Do you know?

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:00.200
If I fight King again...

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.620
I can totally knock King over with a punch.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.210
Yeah.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:05.070
So what?

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.660
Huh?

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.120
That's all?

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.500
So, what do you want me to say?

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.180
Come on, give me a compliment!

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:17.400
If you want a compliment, you gotta pass the tryouts first.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.740
Then get ready to compliment me.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.440
You're definitely giving me one!

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.700
- Come on.
- Come on.

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.630
- You got me fired up.
- Combo 3 hits.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:33.880
Left, right.

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:35.450
Left, right.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:38.900
Come on.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.770
Thank you.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.190
Kamphan.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:06.870
Can I ask you something?

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:07.950
Yeah.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:10.180
Why did you stop boxing?

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.890
A pro like you, it's obvious you're a former boxer.

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:21.920
I bet if you boxed again, you'd win without a sweat.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.850
I really loved boxing when I was a kid.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.850
I still remember my first visit to the boxing stadium with my dad.

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:38.020
Just think about it.

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:41.750
If there are hundreds or thousands of people waiting for our fight in the ring.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.950
But the charm of boxing for me

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.280
is that you're fighting with only your body, nothing else.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.180
If you train a lot, your chances of winning go up,

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.000
and you've gotta show everyone your skills in the ring.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.790
But if you're weak, don't train, and aren't committed,

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:01.310
there's no way you'll win.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.260
I think it's like an equal fight.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:05.360
Just think about it.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:09.080
Two people fighting like crazy in the ring,

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.580
but when the bell rings at the end of the round,

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.070
they apologize to each other.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:17.980
You seem passionate about boxing.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.520
Why'd you quit?

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:25.870
I killed someone.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.410
Killed someone?

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.260
Are you fooling me?

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.700
Even though I didn't actually kill him,

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.840
but I ruined his chance of ever boxing again.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.140
How is that different from killing?

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.730
What happened then?

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:48.830
I have a close friend named Tan Khun.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.520
He is both my friend and my opponent.

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:53.830
He and I are about the same age.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.680
So we were often paired up as boxing sparring partners.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.180
Honestly, he's a better boxer than me.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:04.120
Especially when I got into trouble with seniors or older guys,

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:05.500
he never left my side.

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:09.700
So you fought back and beat them, right?

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.950
Nah.

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:13.420
They stomped me into the ground, just like you.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.260
Do you still want to listen?

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:17.650
Yes.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.530
It was the youth championship that day,

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:24.960
Tan Khun and I were in the same competition.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.790
So the two of us ended up facing each other in the final.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.780
While we wait for the fight,

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:34.450
a group of boxers who had lost to me came at me.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:36.840
They must have been really mad at me,

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:38.710
so they came to cause trouble for us.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:41.299
They walked up and told Tan Khun and me

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.760
that we are husband and wife,

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:44.680
teasing us and calling us gay.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.360
I tried to deny it at the time,

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:50.280
but they didn't stop teasing us.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.880
I couldn't take it anymore, so I punched them.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.890
However, I was pulled onto the ring by the coach.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.480
When I had to fight Tan Khun,

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:01.810
I tried to focus as much as I could.

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:06.010
But while I was fighting, voices from the side of the ring kept coming,

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.720
mocking and insulting me.

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:12.010
I...

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:16.390
I ended up pouring all my anger onto Tan Khun.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.350
Before I realized it,

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.180
I saw him lying still in front of me.

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:26.180
If...

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:29.860
If I ignored what those guys said,

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.410
Tan Khun wouldn't be like this now.

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.330
I think that's ridiculous.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.060
Why?

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.820
Even if you have feelings for Tan Khun,

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:40.380
it's not wrong at all.

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:42.210
Why?

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.830
Who made the rule

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:45.950
that women can only be with men

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.330
and men can only be with women?

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.270
People can love whoever they want.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.520
It's totally fine, whatever the gender.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:56.910
Fine,

00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.860
you told me your secret,

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:02.760
I'll tell you mine too.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.410
Actually...

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.030
Listen up.

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:08.820
My dream is...

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.530
I want to be the lead actor in a BL series.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:17.580
Huh?

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.140
Look at this.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.480
Just a sec.

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.320
Here. Do you see it?

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.150
P and Pan!

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:29.990
From AI No Kisetsu the series.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.080
They went to Japan to film the series.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.970
They became famous after filming ended.

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:37.930
They earned a lot of money.

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:39.320
Moreover, they have a lot of fans.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.210
Damn, they are so fucking awesome.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:44.130
How about this?

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.140
What if we made a clip together

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:48.370
as a ship?

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.150
How about this?

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:55.560
You and I should rehearse.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:57.060
Wanna practice a kiss?

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.130
I'm tired. You can head back now.

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:06.600
Are you shy?

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:07.800
Are you shy?

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.250
Hey, give me a hand!

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.240
Let's practice kissing,

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.939
so I can fulfill my dream of being a BL lead.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:14.989
Come on. Let's practice kissing.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.670
Yim.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.470
Go back!

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.520
I'm staying!

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:20.430
Yim.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.910
Why're you getting shy?

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:33.560
One more time.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:38.160
Okay.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.510
Look at you, you can do it.

00:16:41.511 --> 00:16:43.110
It's late today, let's continue tomorrow.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.040
Are you coming to cheer me on tomorrow?

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:51.540
Hey.

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:53.550
Oh.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.400
You guys are all here.

00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:12.030
Yim, you bastard.

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:19.240
Come on, I like it. One-on-one fights.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.080
Damn, so you think you're good?

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:28.550
Shit, you're cheating!

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:37.780
You think you're good? Damn.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.270
You really think you're the hero?

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:44.530
Shit, he's hitting me back with the same move!

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.610
You think you're good?

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:48.700
Fuck.

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:51.300
Mr. Hero, who could possibly fight you?

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:52.850
You're gonna deal with me.

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.760
Hey, Yim!

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:10.550
YES!

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.709
I'm win!

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:15.870
You gonna be celebrating all day?

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:17.090
How about helping me first?

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:20.680
Damn.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.560
You gonna keep staring at me all day?

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.940
Hey.

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.380
I really apologize to you.

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:39.810
You got screwed because of me.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.070
Yeah.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.310
It's alright.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:44.960
We are friends.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.080
I'm glad too.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:51.340
Glad?

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.260
What are you glad about?

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:57.910
Are you glad I almost got beaten up?

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.510
I'm glad to see your first victory.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:04.670
Oh.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.130
But what the hell kind of winner looks like this?

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:12.470
That's your look,

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:14.260
while

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:20.040
I'm the spotless winner.

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:24.100
Your ego's getting out of hand.

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:26.570
Come on.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:27.910
I'll clean your wound.

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:36.310
First, we need to disinfect it with saline.

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:37.850
And apply some Betadine.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.700
You're good at this.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:43.280
Of course.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:46.150
I am an expert level.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.380
You don't know anything.

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:51.280
I've been through hell!

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:53.400
Come on.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.530
Dr. Yim's here to look after you.

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:57.510
Come on.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.200
But... you're pretty tough.

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.150
You got hit with a bottle and barely got hurt.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.180
I'm gonna apply it now.

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:09.160
Yeah.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.000
What's wrong with you?

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:20.700
You're a big dude,

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:22.270
and this is making you act all dramatic?

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.630
Geez.

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:30.270
What the hell are you doing?

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:31.500
That hurts!

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:33.760
Sure thing! You hurt me first.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:35.170
Huh?

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:36.470
I'm cleaning your wound.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.300
It's fine, I'll do it myself.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.360
I'll do it for you.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:43.380
It's fine. I don't want to trouble you.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.160
Let me do it for you.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:47.270
Just trust Dr. Yim.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:51.030
Stay still.

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:52.050
Be patient.

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:55.320
I don't trust this because of Dr.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.310
Dr. Yim.

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:02.930
You don't know anything at all.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.020
Before I could be Dr. Yim,

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:10.890
I had to take punches, kicks, knees, and elbows.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.210
I've experienced it all.

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:14.700
So, you wanna take another elbow?

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:17.230
I'm good.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.000
Here.

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:35.720
Thanks.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:47.410
Uh.

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.000
I was gonna say this earlier.

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:51.110
You've got a full set of first-aid stuff.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.690
You don't know anything.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.690
I'm an expert at getting beaten up.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.100
Are you happy now?

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:07.130
But I guess from now on,

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:08.760
I won't need them anymore.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:10.980
Why?

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:12.860
I have you here.

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:14.640
Huh?

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:17.750
I have you here.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.050
You are there to help me.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.500
From now on,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.680
if anyone comes to cause trouble for me,

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:26.130
I will punch them all.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.030
Great.

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.210
I've got a new ring name.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:34.470
I...

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.000
Two-Kampham-Yim.

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:38.010
What do you think?

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.960
Is it cool?

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:41.690
What two again?

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.240
Two. (song)

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:48.040
Boxers prefer to use the letter S.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.050
Oh.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:56.100
Does your S stand for bad luck?

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:58.280
Bad luck, my ass!

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:00.550
You don't know anything at all.

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:02.130
Two...

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:06.030
Two means two people, you and me.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.700
You don't know anything.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:13.160
Uh.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:14.560
Send me the boxing gloves.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:18.010
What are you going to do with it?

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.600
Just send it to me.

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:22.920
Go get it for me.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:23.460
Here.

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:25.540
The other one.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:26.980
What are you gonna do with it?

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:28.820
Here.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.830
Wait until I finish writing.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.650
What the hell are you doing?

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.380
Hey, you writing shit about me?

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:48.740
You want me to write on your face instead?

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:50.120
I'll pass.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:23:59.480
Here.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.320
What the heck?

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:11.990
Check it yourself.

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:14.920
What the hell?

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:16.880
It's all wobbly.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:19.750
Hammer?

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:21.270
Hammer?

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:22.730
Did you draw a hammer for me?

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.560
Kamphan. (fist)

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.230
Kamphan?

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:27.190
Yeah.

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:33.020
Kamphan?

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.840
Who taught you to draw?

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:41.130
Your drawing skills are seriously terrible.

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:43.160
Seriously...

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.950
Yim.

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:50.360
Yeah.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:53.780
What you told me earlier,

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:56.170
were you serious?

00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.940
Told...

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:01.940
What is it about?

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:03.000
What did I tell you?

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:05.700
Just...

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:12.150
You told me earlier that it's not only men and women who can fall in love.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:15.400
Oh, this one.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:21.880
It's true.

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:23.240
I really think so.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:27.000
Love must be open-minded.

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:32.720
What if I told you

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:35.410
that I like you?

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:43.450
Oh.

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:44.610
Like me?

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.520
I like you too.

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:51.370
You're so nice to me, how could I not like you?

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:08.830
I'm not sorry.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:10.520
I meant to do it.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:14.100
So if I did this to you,

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:15.720
would you punch me?

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:53.550
What the hell?

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.160
It's kind of shaky.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.080
Hammer?

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:00.230
Did you draw a hammer for me?

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:02.120
Kamphan. (fist)

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:04.000
Kamphan?

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.920
Yeah.

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:10.650
Kamphan?

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.510
Who taught you to draw?

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:18.760
Your drawing skills are seriously terrible.

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:20.600
Seriously...

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.410
Yeah.

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:30.950
At least you'll feel me by your side during your fight tomorrow.

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:33.740
Oh.

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:36.790
You won't feel alone anymore.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.350
Keep your guard tight!

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:02.580
Good.

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:04.110
Good.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:06.550
Good. Good.

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:12.939
Quick! Strike him!

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.940
- Quick! Quick!
- Strike him!

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:29.770
Hey Yim, show some confidence!

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.769
Your boxing has gotten so much better!

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:33.040
Put on a confident face!

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:35.920
Keep your guard up!

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.640
Hey, calm down! Don't rush in yet!

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:47.190
Calm down! Don't rush in yet!

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:52.830
Back off!

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:57.570
Nice!

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.010
Attack again!

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:02.890
Attack!

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:04.320
Attack!

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.710
Attack!

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:06.840
Attack!

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:07.990
Attack!

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:08.860
Lock him up!

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.280
Lock him up!

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:12.890
Attack!

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.350
Quick!

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:24.290
Quick!

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:30.850
Hey, Yim.

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:31.880
Right on!

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:33.710
A real fighter keeps fighting no matter what.

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:34.890
Excellent.

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:36.180
Thank you, bro.

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:01.910
Hey.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.670
Why are you here?

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:06.890
As you can see, I'm practicing boxing.

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:09.270
I know you're practicing boxing.

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:10.650
But how did you get in here?

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:12.840
I've told my dad already.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:14.350
Your dad?

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:15.460
But this is a boxing gym.

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:16.940
Did you ask the owner for permission yet?

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.260
That's right.

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:19.450
I told my dad already.

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:22.270
Yeah, I know you already told your dad.

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:23.510
It's great that you let your dad know.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.760
But this is a boxing gym.

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.500
You must ask permission from the gym owner first.

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:28.650
That's what I mean.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.380
My dad owns a boxing gym.

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:31.230
Huh?

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:38.800
It's good that you're back training.

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:39.990
Yes, Fon.

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:44.250
Huh?

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:46.520
What are you confused about?

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:47.630
Will you practice?

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:48.280
Come on.

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:50.360
What the heck?

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.650
Come on.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:54.870
Come on.

00:30:57.150 --> 00:30:58.230
Do it properly.

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:04.760
Do you like my shirt?

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.370
No.

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.710
I don't have a shirt, so I just wear it.

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:16.890
Damn! I'm not hitting you at all!

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:18.070
I'm exhausted.

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:19.610
Alright.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.260
You've improved so much.

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:22.330
Really?

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.030
Yeah.

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:24.020
Nice.

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.350
Just... I'm a little better than you.

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.960
Hello.

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:52.760
Tan Khun is back.
