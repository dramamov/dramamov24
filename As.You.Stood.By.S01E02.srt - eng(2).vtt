EP 02
HUI-SU

00:00:41.688 --> 00:00:43.565
Hey, Hui-su.
I'll be at the restaurant soon.

00:00:43.648 --> 00:00:46.234
Eun-su, I'm sorry. I'm still at home.

00:00:47.944 --> 00:00:49.112
Why? Is something up?

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:52.615
I had to meet
with my publisher unexpectedly.

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.200
Again?

00:00:55.994 --> 00:00:58.663
Come on, it's been six months
since we last saw each other.

00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:04.002
Yes, I'll be in touch after my deadline.

00:01:07.463 --> 00:01:09.048
I've seen her. That's enough.

00:01:10.675 --> 00:01:13.845
You'll be boarding at 7:10 p.m.
at gate 251.

00:01:13.928 --> 00:01:15.722
-Thank you.
-Enjoy your flight.

00:01:23.563 --> 00:01:25.523
Please put your cardigan in the tray.

00:01:49.047 --> 00:01:50.089
That was all it took…

00:01:53.176 --> 00:01:54.802
yet it took me so long to get here.

00:01:59.098 --> 00:02:00.767
In 500 meters, turn right.

00:02:07.232 --> 00:02:08.816
THE DAY BEFORE

00:02:11.027 --> 00:02:14.364
Mom, are you okay?
I'm sorry, Mom. It's all my fault.

00:02:16.282 --> 00:02:20.495
We're almost at your new nursing home.
It's just a little further ahead…

00:02:31.422 --> 00:02:33.508
How about we go see some lovely flowers?

00:02:39.806 --> 00:02:41.599
You look so pretty, Mom.

00:02:48.022 --> 00:02:49.649
We will now begin boarding.

00:03:01.828 --> 00:03:04.789
JIN-PYO

00:03:20.555 --> 00:03:21.514
Mom?

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:33.026
INCOMING VIDEO CALL: JIN-PYO

00:03:35.445 --> 00:03:36.988
Mom!

00:03:37.071 --> 00:03:40.199
Mom, are you okay? Mom! Oh no! Hold on!

00:03:41.826 --> 00:03:42.660
Ma'am?

00:04:14.817 --> 00:04:16.819
You have two hours, starting now.

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:25.244
Passenger Jo Hui-su,

00:04:25.328 --> 00:04:29.791
traveling on Korean Air's
7:40 p.m. flight to Minneapolis.

00:04:29.874 --> 00:04:31.626
Passenger Jo Hui-su,

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:35.546
please report to gate 251
for immediate boarding.

00:04:52.897 --> 00:04:53.731
Na-ri?

00:05:00.238 --> 00:05:01.072
Na-ri.

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.910
Na-ri. Oh God, no!

00:05:10.123 --> 00:05:11.207
No…

00:08:11.846 --> 00:08:12.847
Get up.

00:10:04.125 --> 00:10:05.126
Just go.

00:10:08.421 --> 00:10:09.630
You have to make it.

00:10:33.696 --> 00:10:36.449
CHILDREN'S BOOK AUTHOR TALK

00:11:08.022 --> 00:11:09.023
I'm coming in.

00:11:18.032 --> 00:11:21.911
After a good night's sleep,
the US stock markets are up.

00:11:22.536 --> 00:11:24.038
What a wonderful morning.

00:11:24.663 --> 00:11:26.040
Did you sleep well too?

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.374
Yes.

00:11:54.443 --> 00:11:56.028
It's not quite as smooth today.

00:11:56.529 --> 00:11:57.363
I'm sorry.

00:11:59.448 --> 00:12:00.825
You can do better tomorrow.

00:12:00.908 --> 00:12:02.117
I'll make sure I do.

00:12:10.417 --> 00:12:11.418
I'm fine.

00:12:12.169 --> 00:12:14.255
I must have been quite upset last night,

00:12:15.589 --> 00:12:17.258
seeing as I've made such a mistake.

00:12:18.133 --> 00:12:19.176
Forgive me.

00:12:21.971 --> 00:12:23.264
Don't ever do that again.

00:12:25.224 --> 00:12:27.601
No matter where you go, I will find you.

00:12:45.911 --> 00:12:47.288
Have another great day.

00:12:47.371 --> 00:12:48.372
You too.

00:13:39.465 --> 00:13:40.925
The doors are opening.

00:13:44.929 --> 00:13:46.472
They're so freaking loud.

00:13:47.097 --> 00:13:49.975
Yesterday, I thought I was
at the freaking Seoul Arts Center.

00:13:51.268 --> 00:13:54.271
I was this close to hurling
the damn plunger at the ceiling,

00:13:54.772 --> 00:13:56.857
but then my mom asked for it again.

00:13:57.608 --> 00:13:59.777
Her poop clogs the toilet
every single time.

00:14:02.071 --> 00:14:03.113
Anyway,

00:14:03.948 --> 00:14:05.783
today's looking shitty already.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:08.744
Sure.

00:14:09.578 --> 00:14:10.579
See ya.

00:14:13.707 --> 00:14:14.708
First floor.

00:14:16.085 --> 00:14:18.504
Come on, you didn't hit the first floor?

00:14:21.799 --> 00:14:23.258
The doors are opening.

00:15:08.053 --> 00:15:09.263
It doesn't feel like home.

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:19.017
Honey?

00:18:05.647 --> 00:18:07.357
I hate when my things get nicked.

00:18:07.441 --> 00:18:08.442
Forgive me.

00:18:19.703 --> 00:18:21.914
You can take your time today.

00:18:27.169 --> 00:18:28.003
First, we do this.

00:18:38.347 --> 00:18:40.015
Since Na-ri is no longer with us,

00:18:41.266 --> 00:18:43.101
you can have my undivided attention.

00:18:46.521 --> 00:18:48.899
Don't change the channel. Stay tuned.

00:18:59.576 --> 00:19:01.370
You had your period last week?

00:19:03.664 --> 00:19:04.498
Yes.

00:19:04.581 --> 00:19:07.251
I still feel regretful
about your miscarriage.

00:19:08.168 --> 00:19:09.878
What a real pity.

00:19:12.756 --> 00:19:14.174
If only you'd told me.

00:19:16.093 --> 00:19:17.344
I didn't know either.

00:19:21.974 --> 00:19:24.268
Being clueless doesn't give you
a free pass.

00:19:26.311 --> 00:19:29.940
I didn't even tap your stomach
that hard that day, but that doctor…

00:19:30.023 --> 00:19:32.192
Thinking about the strange look
they gave me

00:19:33.694 --> 00:19:35.195
still rubs me the wrong way.

00:19:39.866 --> 00:19:41.785
Let's not repeat the same mistakes.

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:44.705
Yes.

00:19:45.998 --> 00:19:46.832
I love you.

00:19:48.083 --> 00:19:48.917
I know you do.

00:19:52.337 --> 00:19:53.380
Thanks for the food.

00:20:17.404 --> 00:20:19.448
-Eun-su--
-Your call cannot be connected.

00:20:19.531 --> 00:20:22.534
Please leave a message after the tone.

00:20:23.118 --> 00:20:25.203
SORRY, I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW

00:21:05.202 --> 00:21:06.286
NA-RI'S TIME TRAVEL

00:21:29.559 --> 00:21:31.103
As you can see from the chart,

00:21:31.186 --> 00:21:34.564
there are signs of a slight rebound
at this point here.

00:21:34.648 --> 00:21:37.818
But MA and MACD indicators
suggest a bear market may--

00:21:37.901 --> 00:21:39.820
I'm well aware of market trends.

00:21:42.948 --> 00:21:43.949
Yes, of course.

00:21:44.449 --> 00:21:49.329
So I think we should closely monitor
the VIX index as we rework our strategy.

00:21:49.413 --> 00:21:51.456
And what's your strategy, Mr. Noh?

00:21:52.624 --> 00:21:55.293
That's precisely why I came prepared.

00:21:56.294 --> 00:21:57.129
Ma'am,

00:21:58.213 --> 00:21:59.214
please excuse me.

00:22:03.301 --> 00:22:04.136
Hello?

00:22:04.219 --> 00:22:05.846
Did you take your supplements?

00:22:05.929 --> 00:22:08.014
I did. Yes, thank you.

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:10.225
I'm with a client now.

00:22:10.725 --> 00:22:12.185
Of course. See you later.

00:22:13.145 --> 00:22:14.896
Gosh, my apologies.

00:22:15.397 --> 00:22:18.942
That was my wife,
checking if I'd taken my supplements.

00:22:20.735 --> 00:22:22.404
You must be good to her.

00:22:23.697 --> 00:22:26.074
So you're not just good
for investment advice.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.328
Honey, when you read mystery novels…

00:22:33.457 --> 00:22:35.167
do you skip to the last page?

00:22:38.128 --> 00:22:39.546
I ran into Eun-su today

00:22:40.338 --> 00:22:41.631
at the department store.

00:22:44.092 --> 00:22:44.926
And still,

00:22:46.178 --> 00:22:47.596
I'm not a fan of hers.

00:22:49.806 --> 00:22:51.266
Your coffee's almost ready.

00:23:16.708 --> 00:23:17.709
It's pretty.

00:23:19.211 --> 00:23:20.086
Turn around.

00:24:27.821 --> 00:24:28.822
Hi, Mom.

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:37.080
We're going out tomorrow.

00:25:22.584 --> 00:25:24.085
Make sure your makeup is perfect.

00:25:24.794 --> 00:25:27.881
Last night, he slammed me against the wall

00:25:28.798 --> 00:25:30.258
and began to choke me.

00:25:31.593 --> 00:25:33.094
It felt like a nightmare.

00:25:33.637 --> 00:25:35.930
I could hardly believe it was happening.

00:25:38.975 --> 00:25:42.604
In the morning,
I woke up aching, covered in bruises.

00:25:44.022 --> 00:25:45.273
But I know for a fact

00:25:45.815 --> 00:25:48.443
that he must feel guilty for what he did.

00:25:49.778 --> 00:25:50.612
Because

00:25:51.946 --> 00:25:52.947
today,

00:25:54.074 --> 00:25:55.533
he sent me flowers.

00:25:58.036 --> 00:25:59.412
At first,

00:26:00.205 --> 00:26:02.707
you genuinely believe it's still love.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.086
After all, he used to be so warm

00:26:07.045 --> 00:26:09.464
and would put you first above all else.

00:26:11.508 --> 00:26:12.842
Then comes the moment

00:26:12.926 --> 00:26:16.221
when you finally realize
you've been abused.

00:26:16.721 --> 00:26:19.683
When you experience violence
that almost kills you.

00:26:27.315 --> 00:26:28.191
By then,

00:26:28.733 --> 00:26:33.029
your self-esteem is already so low
that you can't get out on your own.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.491
You must seek help from those around you.

00:26:37.075 --> 00:26:40.537
It may seem like no one will help,
but that's not true.

00:26:41.037 --> 00:26:44.874
More people than you can imagine
will step in and offer help.

00:26:46.376 --> 00:26:47.752
Let me see your other arm.

00:26:47.836 --> 00:26:50.255
THREE MONTHS AGO

00:26:53.717 --> 00:26:55.385
And your legs, please.

00:26:57.137 --> 00:26:59.973
Here's your medical certificate
and a CD copy of your X-rays.

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:19.033
-Hey, Choi Gyeong-gu.
-Yes, sir.

00:27:19.117 --> 00:27:20.034
You have a guest.

00:27:20.535 --> 00:27:22.245
I didn't know you were assigned here.

00:27:22.328 --> 00:27:25.415
Hey! What brings you here?

00:27:25.498 --> 00:27:26.875
My brother lives nearby.

00:27:27.375 --> 00:27:28.877
In your jurisdiction, I guess.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.170
Oh, does he?

00:27:34.841 --> 00:27:35.675
Hui-su?

00:27:38.845 --> 00:27:39.846
Jin-young.

00:27:43.892 --> 00:27:45.685
What brings you here?

00:27:47.645 --> 00:27:49.022
Do you know each other?

00:27:49.606 --> 00:27:51.191
She's my sister-in-law.

00:27:51.274 --> 00:27:53.276
I see. Hello.

00:27:53.359 --> 00:27:55.653
I was Ms. Noh's junior
at the police academy.

00:27:57.155 --> 00:28:00.450
If I'd known you were her sister-in-law,
I would've assisted you sooner.

00:28:00.533 --> 00:28:01.367
My apologies.

00:28:03.036 --> 00:28:04.162
No, it's all right.

00:28:22.722 --> 00:28:23.556
Jin-young…

00:28:25.642 --> 00:28:27.727
MEDICAL CERTIFICATE OF BODILY HARM

00:28:27.811 --> 00:28:28.812
Hui-su!

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:31.564
Yes?

00:28:33.775 --> 00:28:34.734
Is she a good friend?

00:28:38.947 --> 00:28:41.074
You must have been really worried

00:28:41.157 --> 00:28:43.201
to go as far as filing a report for her.

00:28:46.287 --> 00:28:50.208
I'm sure your friend's not like this,
but make sure you're certain.

00:28:50.834 --> 00:28:55.046
Some women file reports using certificates
from self-inflicted injuries.

00:28:57.549 --> 00:29:00.134
You could face serious charges
for false accusation.

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:07.392
You should tell your friend

00:29:07.475 --> 00:29:10.311
to try and resolve the matter privately,
if possible.

00:29:13.648 --> 00:29:14.482
Why?

00:29:18.194 --> 00:29:21.614
Because 99% of domestic violence cases
go unpunished.

00:29:24.284 --> 00:29:25.702
That's just the reality.

00:29:30.415 --> 00:29:31.249
Take care.

00:29:31.875 --> 00:29:32.709
You too.

00:29:42.802 --> 00:29:45.263
When you come across women
who ask for help,

00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:49.726
please tell them, "It's not your fault."

00:29:52.729 --> 00:29:53.563
And please,

00:29:54.647 --> 00:29:56.316
wrap them tightly in your arms.

00:29:59.485 --> 00:30:02.697
The antonym of love is not hatred.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.825
It's indifference and neglect.

00:30:17.754 --> 00:30:19.047
It was so moving.

00:30:21.549 --> 00:30:24.177
That marked
Ko Jeong-suk's 1,000th lecture.

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:28.431
I'm the eternal ally of Korean women,
so, of course, it should be moving.

00:30:30.391 --> 00:30:31.517
What did you think?

00:30:34.103 --> 00:30:35.104
It was great.

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:37.857
The topic was a bit dark, wasn't it?

00:30:37.941 --> 00:30:41.486
But still, it's a proven classic
that always works.

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:46.532
It just proves how common this is
behind closed doors.

00:30:48.034 --> 00:30:52.121
If only people avoided provoking violence
and both sides did their part.

00:30:52.622 --> 00:30:54.248
It's heartbreaking, really.

00:30:56.417 --> 00:30:57.418
Hui-su,

00:30:58.336 --> 00:30:59.754
did you fall over again?

00:31:00.338 --> 00:31:02.131
Right, yes.

00:31:02.215 --> 00:31:04.217
Down the apartment stairs again?

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:10.181
Son, you'd better go see
building management

00:31:10.264 --> 00:31:14.394
and have a serious talk with them
about fixing the anti-slip stair nosings.

00:31:14.477 --> 00:31:18.564
A man has to step up. Nothing ever changes
when a woman does the talking.

00:31:18.648 --> 00:31:19.482
Of course.

00:31:20.817 --> 00:31:21.818
I should do that.

00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:26.739
-Hi, Mom.
-There you are.

00:31:28.157 --> 00:31:30.493
-You're here early.
-Congratulations, Mom.

00:31:30.576 --> 00:31:33.329
-Thank you.
-I'm sorry I missed your lecture.

00:31:33.413 --> 00:31:36.332
I'm sorry you missed it too.
It couldn't have gone better.

00:31:36.416 --> 00:31:37.959
I'd expect nothing less of you.

00:31:38.042 --> 00:31:39.293
We ordered ages ago.

00:31:42.463 --> 00:31:43.381
You did?

00:31:45.967 --> 00:31:47.218
What's good here?

00:31:48.553 --> 00:31:50.513
Have you been well since, Hui-su?

00:31:54.767 --> 00:31:55.768
Yes.

00:32:13.411 --> 00:32:14.829
Are you leaving already?

00:32:14.912 --> 00:32:17.040
Yes, I have to get back to the station.

00:32:19.208 --> 00:32:22.795
By the way,
what happened to that friend of yours?

00:32:23.796 --> 00:32:25.214
Did you file the report?

00:32:28.634 --> 00:32:29.552
No.

00:32:30.845 --> 00:32:34.223
She said she's too exhausted
to think about any of it anymore.

00:32:35.308 --> 00:32:36.684
Wise decision.

00:32:40.646 --> 00:32:43.816
I mean your friend.
She made the right decision.

00:32:52.992 --> 00:32:55.787
Do you think Jin-young could get
the Presidential Office post?

00:32:56.496 --> 00:32:59.040
She's competent, so I'm sure she will.

00:32:59.749 --> 00:33:01.751
Was it ever even about competence?

00:33:02.877 --> 00:33:05.171
Father's dead,
but his connections got her through.

00:33:09.217 --> 00:33:11.302
Have you been staying in touch
with Jin-young?

00:33:13.888 --> 00:33:14.722
No.

00:33:16.808 --> 00:33:17.934
Earlier, she asked,

00:33:19.227 --> 00:33:22.105
-"Have you been well since?"
-Have you been well since?

00:33:28.236 --> 00:33:29.237
What about it?

00:33:30.738 --> 00:33:31.697
I'm just saying…

00:33:34.367 --> 00:33:37.286
it's not the same as a simple,
"How have you been, Hui-su?"

00:33:40.206 --> 00:33:42.166
Made me think you two share something.

00:33:43.042 --> 00:33:43.876
There's nothing--

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.920
What did you two talk about
in the restroom?

00:33:48.089 --> 00:33:49.173
About Mother's lecture.

00:33:49.257 --> 00:33:50.508
What the fuck?

00:33:52.468 --> 00:33:54.178
She could look it up online.

00:34:06.023 --> 00:34:07.316
How about another drink?

00:34:08.025 --> 00:34:10.153
I already had two drinks back there.

00:34:10.236 --> 00:34:13.698
You can have a drink or two more
when you're with me at home.

00:34:13.781 --> 00:34:16.409
I need to run to the store
to buy some beets.

00:34:17.034 --> 00:34:19.453
I have none
for your morning juice tomorrow.

00:34:20.496 --> 00:34:23.708
I forgot to ask you to drop me off
in front of the store earlier.

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:28.087
Make it quick.

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:30.131
I will.

00:34:53.696 --> 00:34:54.655
Honey.

00:35:06.959 --> 00:35:08.419
US stocks are down again.

00:35:43.746 --> 00:35:45.331
EUN-SU

00:36:32.003 --> 00:36:33.087
I'm sorry, Eun-su.

00:36:57.278 --> 00:36:59.905
YOUR SHIPMENT HAS BEEN DELIVERED

00:37:04.869 --> 00:37:05.911
Hui-su!

00:37:07.455 --> 00:37:08.998
Hui-su. It's me, Eun-su!

00:37:17.798 --> 00:37:19.216
You're in there, aren't you?

00:37:20.843 --> 00:37:21.927
What is it?

00:37:22.011 --> 00:37:23.846
Why are you acting so strange?

00:37:24.764 --> 00:37:27.058
Go, Eun-su. I'll call you later.

00:37:27.141 --> 00:37:29.560
What's going on?
Just open the door for a minute.

00:37:29.643 --> 00:37:32.605
Just… Please, just go.

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:47.161
What happened to you?

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:50.706
Eun-su, you should go now.
Let's talk later.

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:52.917
Don't tell me Jin-pyo did this to you.

00:37:53.793 --> 00:37:57.421
Eun-su. Eun-su! There's a camera here.

00:37:57.505 --> 00:37:58.339
Hurry.

00:38:00.758 --> 00:38:02.676
Please just get over here.

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:17.733
What is all this?

00:38:18.484 --> 00:38:20.194
How long has this been going on?

00:38:21.362 --> 00:38:23.531
It's nothing. These are nothing.

00:38:24.824 --> 00:38:26.158
Just go. It's nothing.

00:38:28.994 --> 00:38:30.454
That necklace you're wearing…

00:38:32.373 --> 00:38:33.374
This.

00:38:34.208 --> 00:38:35.459
Would it suit Hui-su?

00:38:36.669 --> 00:38:39.213
Don't tell me he got you gifts
every time he beat you.

00:38:42.091 --> 00:38:44.552
It's not like that. It was a gift.

00:38:44.635 --> 00:38:47.430
When did this start?
Why didn't you tell me?

00:38:50.975 --> 00:38:53.727
He might get here soon
if he saw the camera. You need to go.

00:38:54.311 --> 00:38:56.856
You need a doctor.
If this injury from the beating gets--

00:38:56.939 --> 00:38:57.773
He didn't beat me.

00:38:59.233 --> 00:39:00.359
I fell. That's all.

00:39:01.318 --> 00:39:03.654
-Then let's go to the police--
-It's not like that.

00:39:05.906 --> 00:39:07.116
So stop.

00:39:10.202 --> 00:39:12.746
What kind of fall
gets you bruised all over like this?

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:15.541
And he's keeping you under surveillance.

00:39:16.625 --> 00:39:18.127
It's all my fault.

00:39:19.712 --> 00:39:22.423
I'm to blame for everything,
so don't worry about it.

00:39:25.009 --> 00:39:26.635
How could I not worry?

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:31.891
When have you ever worried about me?

00:39:35.478 --> 00:39:36.479
Hui-su.

00:39:44.904 --> 00:39:46.572
He's coming home early. You should go.

00:39:48.157 --> 00:39:50.201
I'm going to have to see him before I do.

00:39:50.284 --> 00:39:51.952
-I told you I'm fine--
-This?

00:39:52.036 --> 00:39:53.704
This is your idea of "fine"?

00:39:56.081 --> 00:39:58.626
I thought
my mom wasn't being beaten anymore,

00:39:58.709 --> 00:39:59.710
but I was wrong.

00:40:00.544 --> 00:40:02.505
Dad hit her just yesterday.

00:40:06.926 --> 00:40:07.968
Hui-su,

00:40:08.802 --> 00:40:10.137
it's not too late.

00:40:11.347 --> 00:40:14.016
If you don't do anything,
nothing will change.

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:20.356
Why do you think I didn't do anything?

00:40:26.111 --> 00:40:27.530
I tried confronting him

00:40:28.614 --> 00:40:29.990
and tried running away.

00:40:31.659 --> 00:40:35.120
I even tried to report him,
but it was all pointless.

00:40:37.831 --> 00:40:39.500
I always ended up back here.

00:40:44.129 --> 00:40:45.256
I'll help you now.

00:40:51.679 --> 00:40:53.389
Will you get hit in my place?

00:41:00.646 --> 00:41:01.564
You see, to me…

00:41:04.233 --> 00:41:05.859
not getting beaten tonight…

00:41:08.362 --> 00:41:10.322
taking at least one less hit

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:12.199
is more important.

00:41:16.078 --> 00:41:16.912
So go.

00:41:29.008 --> 00:41:30.009
Today, I--

00:41:30.092 --> 00:41:32.678
We skipped my beet juice this morning.
Make me some now.

00:42:09.882 --> 00:42:12.468
That day we had lunch plans
at the department store,

00:42:13.344 --> 00:42:15.471
you came to tell me,
but you just left, didn't you?

00:42:17.181 --> 00:42:19.224
I should have called you that very day.

00:42:20.434 --> 00:42:21.518
I'm sorry, Hui-su.

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:25.814
How could I

00:42:26.649 --> 00:42:28.609
possibly tell you?

00:42:39.703 --> 00:42:42.831
Do you remember
our favorite color back in the day?

00:42:48.504 --> 00:42:51.465
JULY 2008

00:43:03.936 --> 00:43:05.562
Hui-su, you'd love this color.

00:43:07.189 --> 00:43:08.190
I'm good.

00:43:17.074 --> 00:43:18.575
Where do I apply this?

00:43:20.953 --> 00:43:22.079
-Do I look pretty?
-Yes.

00:43:25.999 --> 00:43:27.334
I love it.

00:43:28.669 --> 00:43:30.003
-Do I look pretty?
-So pretty.

00:43:42.725 --> 00:43:48.480
I thought Class 3, number 35, Jo Eun-su,
always had number 36, Jo Hui-su's back.

00:43:48.981 --> 00:43:50.065
I'm sorry, Hui-su.

00:43:52.359 --> 00:43:53.986
Just know that you're not alone.

00:44:00.909 --> 00:44:02.244
DELETE 7 MESSAGES

00:44:32.608 --> 00:44:34.109
Hello there.

00:44:37.196 --> 00:44:40.491
I live downstairs in unit 1401.

00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:42.785
Right.

00:44:45.454 --> 00:44:46.663
I sleep…

00:44:49.958 --> 00:44:51.168
very late at night.

00:44:52.127 --> 00:44:54.838
Feel free to come down to my place
if you'd like.

00:46:31.518 --> 00:46:32.352
Hello?

00:46:36.148 --> 00:46:39.151
Put on some more lipstick.
You look too pale.

00:46:50.495 --> 00:46:51.622
Where are we going?

00:46:52.623 --> 00:46:53.498
To a battlefield.

00:46:55.375 --> 00:46:58.253
The branch manager would've been long gone
if it weren't for me,

00:46:58.337 --> 00:47:01.381
and yet now he has the nerve
to assess my performance.

00:47:02.883 --> 00:47:05.802
Today, I'll demonstrate
how to land a major client.

00:47:05.886 --> 00:47:07.471
Shut him up for good.

00:47:09.598 --> 00:47:10.432
And Jin-young.

00:47:14.436 --> 00:47:16.188
You didn't say it was an exhibition.

00:47:16.897 --> 00:47:17.898
It's an exhibition.

00:47:19.232 --> 00:47:20.233
So what?

00:47:23.904 --> 00:47:25.739
Smile a little, will you?

00:47:39.962 --> 00:47:42.047
-Better by the day, I see.
-Goodness, hardly.

00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:43.131
Ma'am?

00:47:43.715 --> 00:47:45.592
Hello.

00:47:45.676 --> 00:47:47.552
-Well, how did you know?
-Congratulations.

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:51.098
I'd prefer not to do business
on a day like this.

00:47:51.181 --> 00:47:52.933
I'm not here on business.

00:47:53.016 --> 00:47:54.893
My wife recommended this exhibition.

00:47:55.644 --> 00:47:59.690
You mean that lovely wife of yours
who makes sure you take your supplements?

00:47:59.773 --> 00:48:00.774
Yes.

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:05.112
My wife went to art school,
so we go to a lot of exhibitions.

00:48:05.195 --> 00:48:06.238
Is that so?

00:48:06.738 --> 00:48:09.241
Well, I hope you won't judge
my work too harshly.

00:48:09.324 --> 00:48:12.995
The exhibition is great.
It's truly impressive.

00:48:14.079 --> 00:48:15.580
Take your time to look around.

00:48:15.664 --> 00:48:17.082
Yes, I'll see you later.

00:49:25.192 --> 00:49:26.693
There are lots of eyes on me.

00:49:27.611 --> 00:49:28.612
Cut it out.

00:49:40.957 --> 00:49:42.667
"There are lots of eyes on me."

00:49:43.418 --> 00:49:44.419
"Cut it out."

00:49:51.843 --> 00:49:53.845
You came? Thank you so much.

00:49:55.972 --> 00:49:58.016
She has an incredible imagination.

00:49:58.683 --> 00:49:59.768
Ms. Jo, this is for you!

00:49:59.851 --> 00:50:02.020
2022 BOLOGNA CHILDREN'S BOOK FAIR
PRIZE WINNER EXHIBITION

00:50:02.104 --> 00:50:03.313
Thank you so much!

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:10.612
Three, two, one!

00:50:11.905 --> 00:50:13.657
Three, two, one!

00:50:16.076 --> 00:50:17.077
Bologna?

00:50:22.541 --> 00:50:23.542
Bologna?

00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:26.211
Did you say Bologna?

00:50:27.796 --> 00:50:28.755
Hey.

00:50:30.507 --> 00:50:31.508
Hui-su.

00:50:34.427 --> 00:50:35.720
You want to go all alone?

00:50:43.145 --> 00:50:44.354
You could never.

00:50:53.864 --> 00:50:55.782
I'm not feeling too well.

00:50:58.577 --> 00:51:02.289
I think I'll have to skip
the book fair in Bologna.

00:51:04.457 --> 00:51:05.292
Goodbye.

00:51:54.591 --> 00:51:57.510
I feel shy about having my work
viewed by an art major.

00:52:00.889 --> 00:52:02.390
What is this a painting of?

00:52:04.601 --> 00:52:09.397
I suppose I could cut you some slack
for pretending to pay homage to Picasso.

00:52:11.816 --> 00:52:14.319
But this piece is titled Serenade of Love.

00:52:17.072 --> 00:52:19.115
Where's the love, exactly?

00:52:21.243 --> 00:52:22.452
-Here?
-You're drunk.

00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:27.332
When I was a kid,

00:52:27.958 --> 00:52:32.671
my dad enrolled me
in Gangneung's finest art academy,

00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:36.258
hoping I'd grow up to be
a renowned female artist

00:52:37.008 --> 00:52:38.426
like Shin Saimdang.

00:52:40.679 --> 00:52:41.888
If he could see me now,

00:52:43.431 --> 00:52:44.891
I bet he'd say…

00:52:49.354 --> 00:52:50.897
"They're calling this art

00:52:51.773 --> 00:52:53.275
and this an exhibition, so why…"

00:52:53.358 --> 00:52:54.526
Excuse me?

00:52:55.110 --> 00:52:55.944
Honey.

00:52:58.405 --> 00:52:59.864
Wait one moment.

00:52:59.948 --> 00:53:01.908
I haven't heard her explanation yet.

00:53:01.992 --> 00:53:03.952
So which part of this represents love?

00:53:04.452 --> 00:53:05.870
Let's go this way.

00:53:11.126 --> 00:53:12.377
Ma'am.

00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:15.714
It looks like you've only applied
one layer of gesso on the canvas,

00:53:15.797 --> 00:53:17.424
but you should apply at least--

00:53:26.182 --> 00:53:27.017
Ma'am.

00:53:28.685 --> 00:53:29.519
Forgive me.

00:53:30.395 --> 00:53:32.355
Please excuse us. I'm truly sorry, ma'am.

00:53:40.655 --> 00:53:41.740
I'm sorry.

00:53:41.823 --> 00:53:43.950
Let me go and apologize to her. Please?

00:53:44.784 --> 00:53:46.244
No, wait, please.

00:54:17.317 --> 00:54:19.569
Seat belt off, and don't puke in the car.

00:55:45.613 --> 00:55:47.532
Hui-su, please don't! No!

00:55:55.331 --> 00:55:56.332
Eun-su.

00:56:01.421 --> 00:56:03.381
I want to end it all now.

00:56:03.465 --> 00:56:07.051
No, Hui-su, you can't!

00:56:08.011 --> 00:56:08.887
Please, no!

00:56:10.054 --> 00:56:10.889
No!

00:56:11.556 --> 00:56:13.433
I don't want to die at his hands.

00:56:13.516 --> 00:56:16.478
Noh Jin-pyo's the one who should die.
Why should you have to die?

00:56:19.898 --> 00:56:23.026
Because this won't end
unless someone dies.

00:56:26.321 --> 00:56:28.239
If the worst happens to you too…

00:56:39.918 --> 00:56:40.960
Let's kill him.

00:56:46.007 --> 00:56:47.967
We'll kill your husband.

01:00:19.262 --> 01:00:24.267
