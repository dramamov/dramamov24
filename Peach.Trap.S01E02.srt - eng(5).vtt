00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.810
56 minutes.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.720
57 minutes.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.030
58 minutes.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.020
59 minutes.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.390
60 minutes.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.150
Hey, Yoo Doha!

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.590
You're an hour late.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.650
You owe me 60 ice creams.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.910
Hey, it's because I had to work overtime.
Cut me some slack.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.990
Fine.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.480
As if!

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.870
No no, we had a deal!

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.130
But how could your company

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.330
make a one-month rookie work overtime?

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.759
But work's been fun.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.229
I'm a little scared of the team leader,

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:42.780
but he's quite cool.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.900
Cool, my ass.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.390
You're so unemployed.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.190
What do you know about work life?

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.780
Hey.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.920
Are you looking down on the legendary
national jiu-jitsu athlete, Taek Gyeon?

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.610
Just with this move and I can kill you!

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.090
Code Red!

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.360
Code Red?

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.100
Don't you mean Code Blue, dummy?

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.100
No! It's Code Red between us.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.530
Code Red? What does it mean?

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.540
If I say Code Red,

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:19.820
come to me immediately.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.620
It's an alert that I'm in danger.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.600
Why should I go to you?

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.470
Am I your dog?

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.530
Yes, you're saved as Woof in my phone.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.150
Goodness. Just answer your calls well.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.829
Hey, don't touch my hair!

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:33.780
But seriously,

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.380
you can't even do that for me?

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.590
Three times.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.310
I'll do it for you three times.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.990
This is mutual, dummy!

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.190
I won't let you just order me around.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.250
Let go of me!

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.380
Gosh.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.040
Do you think I can't do a chokehold?

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.500
Wow, you're quite strong.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.600
Hey, you want a piece of me?

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.220
Don't mess with me.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.420
You want a piece of me?

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.300
Is he okay?

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.140
Where are you?

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.690
Yoo Doha!

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.720
Huh?

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:03.920
Are you okay?

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.260
What? What do you mean?

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.529
Let's talk outside.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.760
Are you here for coffee?

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.500
Or are you Doha-hyung's guest?

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.020
We're closing soon.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.780
If you want to order,
you have to do it now.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.210
Shall I take your order?

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.880
No, thanks. Let's go.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.090
What are you doing?

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.730
Uh...

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.240
That's all I have to say.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.240
Let's talk about the details later.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.510
Your friend came for you. You should go.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.850
I'll contact you again.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.050
I'll buy you a meal next time.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.070
Sure.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.330
As for the restaurant,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.520
I'll look it up and text you the location.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.720
What are you doing? Let's go.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:27.230
Doha-hyung.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.500
Don't forget to contact me too.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.630
Uh... okay.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.680
Hey, are you mad at me?

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:55.510
No.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.140
You sure? I know you're angry.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.200
I'm not.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.540
Just forgive me this time,

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.880
okay? Yeah?

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.780
You also tricked me. Twice, even.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.400
Goodness.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.720
I told you not to touch my hair.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:17.960
Oh, right.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.210
Mr. Jeon just recommended me for a job.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.980
That guy at the cafe? Why?

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.800
Wow... Why?

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.060
What do you mean "why"?

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:28.830
I may not look like it,

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.430
but I was recognized
for my competence at work.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.130
Are you sure there aren't other reasons?

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.170
What other reasons?

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.950
Do you mean he pitied me?

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.020
No, that's not what I meant...

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.930
Are you kidding me, dude?

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:44.740
Hey, wait.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.060
Goodness.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.820
I told you not to touch my hair!

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:53.740
Hurry up.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:14.040
Gyeon was a bit... weird today.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.260
I'll buy you a meal next time.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.340
Sure.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.580
Doha-hyung,
don't forget to contact me too.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.400
Uh... okay.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.410
Yoo Doha.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.850
Still sleeping?

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.500
This is driving me crazy.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.240
Why is he...

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:05.060
Why doesn't he wear his clothes properly?

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.350
What's going on? When did you come?

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.790
Get up!

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:15.790
I know you were fired,
but you can't just sleep all day.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.170
Oh my god, your belt...

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:30.440
What? You didn't explain it properly.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.970
You just told me to put it on.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:34.620
Look at you pouting.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.800
How did you even tie your belt like that?

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.200
A 27-year-old
who can't put on clothes properly.

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:54.890
This is a belt.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:23.990
Done. Let's start... with stretches.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.080
Pft. You want a piece of me?

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:01.960
Don't tell me...

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.380
he didn't save my number?

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:07.770
Wait! Hold on! I give up!

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.580
Hey, isn't this too intense
for a first lesson?

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.240
Jiu-jitsu teaches you
real-life self defense.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.420
If strange people approach you,

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.620
you must... take them down right away.

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:25.640
Can I learn too?

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.420
Oh?

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.020
What are you doing here?

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.470
Doha-hyung, are you learning jiu-jutsu?

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:42.040
Perfect. We can learn together.

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:44.340
By the way,

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.320
why didn't you call me?

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.370
Sorry, I've been a bit busy.

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:52.720
Wow, I can't believe this.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.140
I've been waiting for your call.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.530
I'm sorry. I'll save your number.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.440
Give me your phone.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.640
I'll type it for you. Save it right away.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:08.080
My phone...

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.060
Hey, over there.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:13.750
Give me a sec.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.160
Can I sign up too?

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.360
I want to learn about
real-life self defense too.

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:25.460
To sign up, go over there.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.580
Are you signing up?

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:47.120
Yes.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.790
Because you're learning here too.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.860
When do you have lessons?

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.300
Just whenever—

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:58.170
Then I'll come when you come—

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:01.890
Hey, hey... Here. You didn't fill this in.

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:06.130
Oh... Okay.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:15.230
Hello, Mr. Jeon.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:17.960
Yes.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.820
Do you spar with students too?

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.780
Have you done sports before?

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:27.540
A little.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.150
It depends on your skills.

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:30.840
If you reach the level of sparring,

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.900
I'll spar with you.

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:34.240
You spar with Doha-hyung, though.

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:37.730
Since we're both beginners,

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.020
I can spar with Doha-hyung.

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.980
You will receive coaching...

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:48.880
from him.

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:51.570
He'll take care of you from now on.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:55.970
Hello, I'm Lee Hanwool.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:05.850
I have to go.
I have to meet someone tonight.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:08.580
Finish up with your registration.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.490
Bye.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.140
It should be around here.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.200
I didn't know there was such a place.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.670
Do you have an appointment?

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.560
Under Jeon Yeonsang.

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:56.790
It's the table inside.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:24.190
You're early.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:25.780
Yes.

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.270
The ambiance is really nice.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.320
Let's order first before we talk.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.020
Uh, okay.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.780
I promised to treat him this time.

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:54.650
Can I order some wine?

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:57.890
Uh, yeah.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:04.940
It's so expensive.

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:19.390
I think you should stop drinking.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:23.589
It's so delicious I just kept drinking.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.500
One last glass.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:26.730
Okay.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.700
You're surprisingly gentle.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:36.410
Surprisingly?

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:40.080
You always look so serious.

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:42.980
I'm a little afraid of you.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.720
You always just scold me...

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.280
When did I always scold you?

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:53.670
That's why I thought
I must be really bad at my job.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:54.700
You're not bad—

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:55.760
I guess I was wrong.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:00.440
You even personally
recommended me for a job.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:06.280
It doesn't matter if it works out or not.
I'm already happy.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.100
Because you recommended me for a job.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:14.930
It makes me feel like I'm still useful.

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:16.920
After all, I got your recognition.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.280
Thank you.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.940
You're good with work.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:32.700
Why do you keep smiling?

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:36.040
You just smiled too.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.050
I didn't.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.070
No, you did smile.

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.190
Yoo Doha.

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:02.160
You just let down your guard whenever,
don't you?

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.150
I need to use the restroom.

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:36.820
He's so unpredictable when he gets drunk.

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:39.320
Excuse me.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:39.880
Yes.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:43.040
Bill, please.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.270
I said I'm fine.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.730
I'll ask you one last time.
Where do you live?

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.760
It's close...

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.800
That's why I'm taking you home.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:17.030
Where is it?

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.050
You just said it was the last time
you'd ask me.

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:28.700
I'm busy.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:30.800
Tell me before I scold you.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.150
O... Over there.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.130
Crazy.

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:17.570
This is crazy.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.810
I don't remember anything.

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:45.480
Yoo Doha!

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:51.580
Why? Is there a cockroach?

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:55.670
Then why'd you scream?

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:58.810
I...

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:01.540
I...

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:02.770
What's wrong?

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.190
I did it. It happened.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:11.960
What?

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:15.310
I had my first kiss.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.780
With my team leader!

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:16.790
[Peach Trap]

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.450
Mr. Jeon wasn't the only one there.

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:20.550
Who else was there?

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.380
Don't you remember anything?

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.640
Did you forget that
you met me that day?

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:31.770
When did you start wearing this?

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:34.060
I told you not to
tie your shoelaces like this,

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.260
but you never listen.

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:38.780
You two must be really close.

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:40.110
Because we're friends.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.190
You keep avoiding me. Scared to lose, huh?

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.080
I won't lose to you in other aspects.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.890
I don't plan to lose either.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.320
Doha-hyung, you tell us.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.120
Who do you want that person to be?

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:56.530
Mr. Jeon.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.700
Did I do anything that I shouldn't have?
