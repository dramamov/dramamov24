AS YOU STOOD BY

00:00:17.455 --> 00:00:20.375
EP 06
EUN-SU, HUI-SU, AND JANG KANG

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:57.370
Who are you?

00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:21.936
Please leave. Now.

00:01:23.104 --> 00:01:24.355
You going to report me?

00:01:29.277 --> 00:01:30.612
What will you tell them?

00:01:36.034 --> 00:01:37.660
That the husband you killed

00:01:38.244 --> 00:01:39.579
has come back to life?

00:01:41.206 --> 00:01:42.290
Well?

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:01.726
You've come to the wrong place.
Please leave.

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.064
You're looking better.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.113
You looked miserable at the café
when you broke that cup and spilled ice.

00:02:14.697 --> 00:02:16.950
You must have found a new zest for life

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.535
now that you've killed your husband.

00:02:21.162 --> 00:02:23.748
I'm not sure what you mean.
My husband's on his way home--

00:02:23.831 --> 00:02:24.832
Noh Jin-pyo?

00:02:28.962 --> 00:02:29.963
That day,

00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:32.507
I dragged him out of this house.

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.093
Just like this, no? Like this.

00:02:35.176 --> 00:02:36.844
Noh Jin-pyo, that fucker.

00:02:36.928 --> 00:02:38.388
Weighed a fucking ton.

00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:50.149
Your place doesn't smell
so luxurious today.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.163
That must've been where the camera was.

00:03:15.675 --> 00:03:17.510
It's the exact angle.

00:03:25.893 --> 00:03:27.270
It must've hurt a lot.

00:03:29.605 --> 00:03:31.566
As soon as you land, discard it.

00:03:34.444 --> 00:03:36.154
Hey, stop that.

00:03:36.237 --> 00:03:38.823
Do you know how much it cost me
to restore this thing?

00:03:39.741 --> 00:03:40.742
Why are you here?

00:03:47.373 --> 00:03:48.583
What's the rush?

00:03:49.917 --> 00:03:51.794
I haven't even had a tour of the house.

00:04:03.765 --> 00:04:04.599
Open it.

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.063
I don't know the passcode.

00:04:12.398 --> 00:04:13.232
Open it.

00:04:28.998 --> 00:04:31.167
The passcode does not match.

00:04:38.257 --> 00:04:40.218
-The passcode does not match.
-Are you shitting me?

00:04:42.136 --> 00:04:43.638
Have it open by tomorrow.

00:04:47.016 --> 00:04:47.850
And…

00:04:50.478 --> 00:04:51.479
three billion.

00:04:52.897 --> 00:04:53.731
Sorry?

00:04:53.815 --> 00:04:56.234
The price for my silence
about how you and Jo Eun-su

00:04:57.527 --> 00:04:58.778
murdered Noh Jin-pyo.

00:05:02.532 --> 00:05:05.326
It's not like that.
Eun-su had nothing to do with it.

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:07.912
Three billion.

00:05:10.873 --> 00:05:12.834
I don't have money.

00:05:15.503 --> 00:05:16.337
Is that right?

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:20.591
Guess I'll have to pay Noh Jin-young
a visit at the Seocho Police Station.

00:05:27.723 --> 00:05:28.724
Sounds like fun.

00:05:51.622 --> 00:05:52.957
It's my mother-in-law.

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:54.459
She must be nearby.

00:05:54.542 --> 00:05:56.210
MOTHER

00:06:01.716 --> 00:06:04.093
She said she'd stay over.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.477
It'd be fun to get us three together.

00:06:16.063 --> 00:06:17.273
Then what about the money?

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:27.033
Answer it.

00:06:27.533 --> 00:06:29.035
Answer and tell her not to come.

00:06:30.745 --> 00:06:33.956
She'll sense something's off
the moment I say "hello."

00:06:35.166 --> 00:06:37.001
She might even call the police.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:41.797
Fuck this.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.156
What if someone sees you?

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.035
Finally, some honesty.

00:07:21.963 --> 00:07:23.548
I can evade cameras

00:07:24.298 --> 00:07:25.675
as if I was never there.

00:07:26.342 --> 00:07:27.343
You and Jo Eun-su

00:07:28.427 --> 00:07:30.137
got real lucky, you know that?

00:07:32.682 --> 00:07:33.766
You have five days.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:36.811
Got it?

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:39.814
Okay.

00:08:04.255 --> 00:08:06.340
MOTHER

00:08:12.888 --> 00:08:15.141
Hello, Mother.
Sorry, I was getting cleaned up.

00:08:15.224 --> 00:08:16.892
Did you have a bubble bath?

00:08:17.643 --> 00:08:18.644
Any word from Jin-pyo?

00:08:19.145 --> 00:08:20.563
No, he hasn't been in touch.

00:08:21.314 --> 00:08:22.148
All right.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.627
I haven't seen you in a while.

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:44.128
Were you away somewhere?

00:08:45.838 --> 00:08:50.885
Your mother insisted
that I call as soon as I saw you.

00:08:50.968 --> 00:08:53.179
I've been keeping my eyes peeled,

00:08:53.262 --> 00:08:55.681
so it's truly a pleasure
to see you here again.

00:09:03.314 --> 00:09:04.315
So what?

00:09:05.149 --> 00:09:07.318
You want some beer money for your trouble?

00:09:07.401 --> 00:09:09.820
Goodness, sir. It's not like that at all.

00:09:15.451 --> 00:09:18.287
I have to get something from my car.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:20.665
Care to come with me?

00:10:05.376 --> 00:10:06.544
Not that way.

00:10:17.555 --> 00:10:18.931
Well, fuck me.

00:11:27.917 --> 00:11:30.544
Tell Jo Hui-su. Her phone is turned off.

00:11:36.592 --> 00:11:37.593
Who is this?

00:11:39.094 --> 00:11:42.640
The fuck are you playing at?
Didn't you know that I was back?

00:11:43.766 --> 00:11:44.600
Mr. Jang Kang?

00:11:45.142 --> 00:11:46.227
It's been a while.

00:11:46.977 --> 00:11:47.812
I'm in Seoul.

00:11:48.395 --> 00:11:50.314
Did you forget you swore never to return?

00:11:50.397 --> 00:11:51.941
Yeah, I forgot about that.

00:11:57.571 --> 00:12:00.324
I was just at Jo Hui-su's place.

00:12:00.407 --> 00:12:02.326
Are you nuts? You went to see Hui-su?

00:12:04.411 --> 00:12:06.580
Three billion won. Five days.

00:12:07.957 --> 00:12:09.124
You'd best hurry.

00:12:20.761 --> 00:12:21.679
HUI-SU

00:12:21.762 --> 00:12:25.683
The person you are calling is unavailable.
Please leave a message…

00:12:29.687 --> 00:12:31.814
Looks like something awful has happened.

00:12:33.566 --> 00:12:35.693
I did hear sirens late at night.

00:12:35.776 --> 00:12:37.111
Ma'am, we can't let you pass.

00:12:37.194 --> 00:12:39.530
-One moment, please.
-No, we can't let you on site.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.615
-Ma'am, please.
-Let me through.

00:12:41.699 --> 00:12:43.993
-I'm telling you, I can't.
-Was the victim a woman?

00:12:44.076 --> 00:12:46.328
It wasn't a woman.
It was the security guard.

00:12:46.412 --> 00:12:48.247
The security guard passed away.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.929
HUI-SU

00:13:05.014 --> 00:13:07.308
The person you are calling
is unavailable--

00:13:32.875 --> 00:13:34.043
Morning, Mr. Jin.

00:13:37.087 --> 00:13:38.255
This isn't like Hui-su.

00:13:39.089 --> 00:13:41.717
I take it you've had it easy
thanks to Hui-su lately.

00:13:52.144 --> 00:13:53.145
Hey, good morning.

00:13:53.228 --> 00:13:56.148
Yes, hello, Mr. Jin.
Has Hui-su come in today?

00:13:56.231 --> 00:13:58.442
Not yet. She's running a bit late today.

00:13:58.525 --> 00:13:59.985
Then, Mr. Jin,

00:14:00.694 --> 00:14:03.280
do you happen to know
where Mr. Jang Kang is staying?

00:14:06.867 --> 00:14:07.910
Jang Kang?

00:14:07.993 --> 00:14:09.036
Never mind.

00:14:09.119 --> 00:14:12.665
Could you please tell Hui-su to call me
when she arrives at work?

00:14:12.748 --> 00:14:13.749
Take care.

00:14:16.293 --> 00:14:17.294
What was that?

00:14:24.551 --> 00:14:25.803
Morning, Mr. Jin.

00:14:28.472 --> 00:14:29.306
Hey.

00:14:31.266 --> 00:14:32.643
Is Jang Kang back, perhaps?

00:14:33.978 --> 00:14:35.062
How did you know?

00:14:35.688 --> 00:14:37.731
He got back two days ago.
We haven't met yet.

00:15:00.254 --> 00:15:02.715
Excuse me.
Could I perhaps charge my phone?

00:15:03.215 --> 00:15:04.341
Sure, I'll take it.

00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:17.563
Sorry, could I get that?

00:15:18.063 --> 00:15:19.231
Right, one moment.

00:15:32.536 --> 00:15:33.370
Hello?

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.043
I got the safe open.

00:15:42.379 --> 00:15:43.213
Yes.

00:15:51.055 --> 00:15:52.765
-Mom.
-Hey.

00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:58.228
What's wrong?

00:15:58.312 --> 00:15:59.480
Well, the thing is…

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.523
I can't be away for too long.

00:16:03.108 --> 00:16:06.028
The security guard
at Jin-pyo's apartment is dead.

00:16:06.695 --> 00:16:07.529
And?

00:16:09.281 --> 00:16:11.241
-You should go and check.
-I'm busy.

00:16:11.325 --> 00:16:12.326
Well, you see…

00:16:13.952 --> 00:16:18.916
I had asked the guard who died
to keep an eye on Hui-su.

00:16:20.375 --> 00:16:21.251
Mom.

00:16:21.335 --> 00:16:24.046
Hui-su seems sketchy
in more ways than one.

00:16:24.129 --> 00:16:27.341
What's so sketchy about her?
Jin-pyo's the one who's really sketchy.

00:16:27.424 --> 00:16:28.258
Jin-young!

00:16:28.926 --> 00:16:31.303
How can you compare Jin-pyo
to the likes of her?

00:16:32.221 --> 00:16:36.225
Isn't it odd how she was unemployed
all this time but suddenly found a job?

00:16:36.308 --> 00:16:38.852
She's going on just fine,
as if nothing happened!

00:16:38.936 --> 00:16:41.313
Mom, seriously.
Why are you being like this?

00:16:45.943 --> 00:16:46.777
Hui-su!

00:16:47.402 --> 00:16:49.613
Where have you been?
Your phone's been off.

00:16:50.447 --> 00:16:51.698
The doors are closing.

00:16:51.782 --> 00:16:53.492
I forgot to charge it.

00:16:53.575 --> 00:16:57.788
You should've called me last night.
I would have come running right away.

00:16:57.871 --> 00:16:59.206
That's exactly why I didn't.

00:17:00.207 --> 00:17:01.667
Nothing happened, right?

00:17:02.876 --> 00:17:03.710
Yeah.

00:17:04.711 --> 00:17:05.712
I thought…

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:14.012
This won't be nearly enough for Jang Kang.

00:17:14.096 --> 00:17:15.639
Just what will you do with this?

00:17:16.807 --> 00:17:19.268
I'll put Mom's house up for urgent sale.

00:17:19.351 --> 00:17:20.686
As well as this place.

00:17:21.687 --> 00:17:24.898
I'll scrape together as much money
as I can and ask him to go back.

00:17:24.982 --> 00:17:26.525
And what if he comes back?

00:17:27.025 --> 00:17:30.487
What if we give him what he wants
and he keeps coming back to blackmail us?

00:17:32.114 --> 00:17:33.991
-I'll settle this for good.
-No, don't.

00:17:35.284 --> 00:17:38.120
-Three billion in three days is--
-Just stay out of it.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.211
What's gotten into you?

00:17:47.421 --> 00:17:48.422
Jang Kang

00:17:50.257 --> 00:17:52.759
is far more dangerous
than you can imagine.

00:17:57.973 --> 00:17:58.974
He's the one…

00:18:01.185 --> 00:18:02.978
who killed the security guard.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.735
The detectives who came this morning

00:18:09.818 --> 00:18:12.154
already went through all of Kim's things.

00:18:12.237 --> 00:18:15.032
But I did find this in here just now.

00:18:16.033 --> 00:18:17.159
This was Kim's.

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:18.827
I see.

00:18:18.911 --> 00:18:19.745
Right.

00:18:23.999 --> 00:18:25.042
Sir.

00:18:25.125 --> 00:18:25.959
Yes?

00:18:26.585 --> 00:18:28.003
I'm from unit 703.

00:18:28.086 --> 00:18:29.963
The pest control scheduled next week,

00:18:30.881 --> 00:18:32.966
which block are you starting with?

00:18:33.508 --> 00:18:35.510
Could we do it before 9:00, by any chance?

00:18:36.094 --> 00:18:37.387
Apologies, ma'am.

00:18:37.471 --> 00:18:40.557
It's done by a contractor,
so I don't think they can start…

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:54.404
Jin-young?

00:18:56.323 --> 00:18:59.618
If I were in your shoes, I wouldn't
have been able to report it either.

00:19:01.078 --> 00:19:02.996
Let's deal with Jang Kang first.

00:19:03.622 --> 00:19:07.084
He can threaten us all he wants,
but he doesn't have any concrete evidence.

00:19:07.584 --> 00:19:10.754
Noh Jin-pyo's phone won't provide proof
of what happened to him.

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:15.342
Jang Kang won't visit
Noh Jin-pyo's sister either.

00:19:15.926 --> 00:19:18.345
If he's seen,
he would have to forget about the money.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.390
He can't come here anymore either.

00:19:25.227 --> 00:19:27.354
What happened to the guard is unfortunate,

00:19:28.063 --> 00:19:31.441
but the longer this drags out,
the more it'll hurt him, not us.

00:19:33.694 --> 00:19:34.820
Still, Eun-su, I--

00:19:34.903 --> 00:19:35.904
We.

00:19:41.785 --> 00:19:42.619
Right.

00:19:46.498 --> 00:19:48.917
This is my first case
in the Violent Crimes Unit.

00:19:49.001 --> 00:19:51.628
It's funny I ran into you here, Jin-young.

00:19:51.712 --> 00:19:52.546
I know, right?

00:19:53.171 --> 00:19:56.258
I was at my brother's and swung by
when I heard about the incident.

00:19:56.341 --> 00:19:59.761
Well, it's almost uncanny
how nothing was caught on camera.

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:04.224
The video quality is already bad,
but last night's drizzle didn't help.

00:20:09.229 --> 00:20:10.063
Here.

00:20:11.148 --> 00:20:12.149
You missed this.

00:20:13.066 --> 00:20:15.319
Thank you so much, Jin-young.

00:20:17.279 --> 00:20:19.323
How could I miss something so important?

00:20:21.867 --> 00:20:22.701
Yes, hello?

00:20:23.618 --> 00:20:25.287
-I'll just take this.
-Sure.

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.205
Yes, I'm still looking into it.

00:20:59.112 --> 00:21:00.238
DELETING FILE

00:21:00.322 --> 00:21:01.406
FILE DELETED

00:21:04.409 --> 00:21:05.243
Jin-young.

00:21:06.203 --> 00:21:07.037
Yes?

00:21:07.788 --> 00:21:09.581
-Nothing much, is there?
-Yeah.

00:21:11.541 --> 00:21:12.542
The way I see it,

00:21:13.168 --> 00:21:15.712
the bastard has a knack
for avoiding security cameras.

00:21:16.713 --> 00:21:18.090
Or it could be a bitch.

00:21:18.965 --> 00:21:19.800
Sorry?

00:21:24.388 --> 00:21:28.725
Right, yes. Of course.
Man, you really are the best.

00:21:28.809 --> 00:21:30.352
Hey, do you have a minute?

00:21:31.186 --> 00:21:33.271
Remember what I asked for last time?

00:21:33.772 --> 00:21:35.732
Any new entry records since then?

00:21:42.531 --> 00:21:43.615
None yet?

00:21:45.075 --> 00:21:46.660
So this person is not in Korea?

00:21:50.372 --> 00:21:51.873
Yes, let's catch up soon.

00:21:52.874 --> 00:21:53.708
Bye.

00:21:55.961 --> 00:21:57.546
You can't come back just yet.

00:21:59.381 --> 00:22:01.508
Not until my assignment's confirmed.

00:22:04.678 --> 00:22:08.682
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
Please leave a message after the--

00:22:11.685 --> 00:22:13.687
Don't even think about going to Hui-su's.

00:22:14.187 --> 00:22:15.689
The place is teeming with cops.

00:22:16.273 --> 00:22:18.483
I'll come to you right now.
Send me your address.

00:22:26.825 --> 00:22:28.493
MS. KIM MI-GYEONG

00:22:29.536 --> 00:22:30.579
Yes, Ms. Kim?

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:33.415
Would you do this dress the honor?

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:55.103
Sorry, I'll just be one moment.
Please cover for me.

00:22:59.357 --> 00:23:01.860
Are you insane?
This place is full of people.

00:23:03.612 --> 00:23:05.697
Scared people will find out
Noh Jin-pyo's back?

00:23:06.948 --> 00:23:07.949
Follow me.

00:23:09.075 --> 00:23:10.076
The fuck?

00:23:13.538 --> 00:23:15.290
Who are you to tell me what to do?

00:23:16.124 --> 00:23:17.292
You're just a murderer.

00:23:18.585 --> 00:23:19.628
Are you insane?

00:23:25.592 --> 00:23:26.927
Someone's watching us.

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:32.224
If you want the money, follow me.

00:23:34.351 --> 00:23:35.185
Hello.

00:23:35.268 --> 00:23:36.102
Hello.

00:23:36.186 --> 00:23:38.605
Hello. Are you here to look at necklaces?

00:23:43.693 --> 00:23:44.945
Do you know me, miss?

00:23:45.695 --> 00:23:47.781
-Sorry?
-He's just joking.

00:23:47.864 --> 00:23:48.782
After you, sir.

00:23:52.285 --> 00:23:53.286
Excuse me.

00:23:55.413 --> 00:23:57.374
Fly back on the red-eye tonight.

00:23:57.457 --> 00:23:58.458
Hey.

00:23:59.084 --> 00:24:00.335
Ease up, will you?

00:24:01.836 --> 00:24:04.297
I have no interest
in the dead Noh Jin-pyo.

00:24:04.381 --> 00:24:06.716
What do you mean he's dead?
Do you have any proof?

00:24:11.596 --> 00:24:13.098
I'm not surprised you killed him.

00:24:14.474 --> 00:24:18.395
He beat her, kept her under surveillance,
and tracked her location.

00:24:21.189 --> 00:24:23.066
And you were acting so smart.

00:24:25.402 --> 00:24:29.114
So you didn't know this prick
was tracking Jo Hui-su's location?

00:24:30.282 --> 00:24:31.241
Look.

00:24:38.957 --> 00:24:39.916
Give me his phone.

00:24:41.376 --> 00:24:42.877
Hey, the bag of cash comes first.

00:24:43.587 --> 00:24:46.006
Hand it over or I report you
for murdering the guard.

00:24:46.089 --> 00:24:47.674
And if you report me?

00:24:47.757 --> 00:24:51.636
Do you think I'd go down alone?
Think I wouldn't give you two up?

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.471
What good would that do you?

00:24:53.555 --> 00:24:56.391
If the police catch us,
you won't get a single penny.

00:24:58.435 --> 00:24:59.269
Is that so?

00:25:01.271 --> 00:25:04.566
Then let's include the price of the phone.
That's 3.1 billion.

00:25:08.945 --> 00:25:11.114
Now you're as scared
as you should've been.

00:25:12.115 --> 00:25:13.950
You shouldn't have taken me lightly.

00:25:21.291 --> 00:25:22.167
Ms. Jo!

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:24.210
-Yes?
-She's been looking for you.

00:25:29.424 --> 00:25:31.051
KO JEONG-SUK'S BY YOUR SIDE

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.388
-Hello, I'm such a fan.
-Hello. Thank you so much.

00:25:36.514 --> 00:25:39.309
-I'm so happy to meet you.
-Thank you so much.

00:25:43.855 --> 00:25:45.398
Ms. Ko, I'm a huge fan.

00:25:46.983 --> 00:25:48.652
-I'm so glad to meet you.
-Thank you.

00:25:48.735 --> 00:25:50.195
-Could I take a picture?
-Sure.

00:25:52.322 --> 00:25:55.825
My friend says her marriage
has improved so much, thanks to you,

00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:57.577
but she couldn't make it today.

00:25:57.661 --> 00:26:00.622
-Could I get her an autograph?
-Of course, sure.

00:26:02.499 --> 00:26:04.751
-Hello.
-I'm a huge fan.

00:26:05.502 --> 00:26:07.962
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Of course.

00:26:16.054 --> 00:26:18.306
Mom, I'm on the run.

00:26:22.894 --> 00:26:24.396
WHERE ARE…

00:26:24.479 --> 00:26:27.482
I'm out of money.
Mom, please give me some money.

00:26:35.407 --> 00:26:38.410
Remarks like that
often worsen a relationship

00:26:38.493 --> 00:26:40.537
rather than resolve the problem.

00:26:41.413 --> 00:26:42.789
Why do you think that is?

00:26:43.289 --> 00:26:46.876
It's because we misunderstand
each other's intentions,

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.336
not their actual words.

00:26:49.254 --> 00:26:53.550
Conversation is the process
of understanding each other's intentions,

00:26:53.633 --> 00:26:56.094
but we often start by being defensive.

00:26:58.138 --> 00:27:02.475
A married couple
is at the heart of a family.

00:27:03.476 --> 00:27:06.312
If we come to understand
each other's language

00:27:06.396 --> 00:27:09.691
and even start conversing
in each other's languages…

00:27:09.774 --> 00:27:12.026
No one can know about the money or me.

00:27:12.694 --> 00:27:14.863
And don't reach out to me before I do.

00:27:14.946 --> 00:27:17.949
Having parents who actively communicate

00:27:18.032 --> 00:27:21.202
is like having
the world's greatest blessing.

00:27:21.828 --> 00:27:22.829
Hey, lady.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.708
Keep quiet for just a few more days, okay?

00:27:27.792 --> 00:27:29.961
It all begins with one little remark.

00:27:30.462 --> 00:27:36.259
You need to listen, empathize with,
and understand each other's intentions…

00:27:38.178 --> 00:27:39.179
Chairman Wang.

00:27:39.679 --> 00:27:43.808
Could you perhaps refer me
to a reliable agency to handle a job?

00:27:44.642 --> 00:27:47.729
I'm not asking for myself
but on behalf of a client.

00:27:51.649 --> 00:27:52.650
All right. Sure.

00:27:55.528 --> 00:27:56.529
Take care, sir.

00:28:04.162 --> 00:28:05.163
Hey, Jang Kang.

00:28:05.663 --> 00:28:08.416
So you're actually back?

00:28:10.794 --> 00:28:11.795
Wi.

00:28:12.462 --> 00:28:15.423
If you were going to come back so soon,
why go in the first place?

00:28:15.507 --> 00:28:19.010
Anyway, where are you staying?
Hey, come here.

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:23.348
Have a bite, yeah? It's on me.

00:28:26.518 --> 00:28:30.396
Don't worry about it.
It's been a while, so it's my treat.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.482
Ma'am, we'll take a serving of soondae.

00:28:33.274 --> 00:28:34.359
Go on. Eat up.

00:28:34.442 --> 00:28:35.276
There's no need.

00:28:37.403 --> 00:28:38.488
Ma'am, ring us up.

00:28:43.326 --> 00:28:44.327
Hey, what?

00:28:44.953 --> 00:28:47.497
Keep the change
and deduct it whenever he orders.

00:28:50.166 --> 00:28:51.167
Hey, Wi.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.378
We should grab a drink, yeah?

00:29:02.637 --> 00:29:03.763
Go easy on them.

00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:06.099
-She's the best here.
-He's a pro.

00:29:15.567 --> 00:29:16.568
Great hand.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:30.039
I don't see Manager Ma
from the PI agency here today.

00:29:30.665 --> 00:29:33.668
Let him know that
if someone named Jo Eun-su calls,

00:29:34.252 --> 00:29:36.671
he should assign his best guy to the job.

00:29:38.089 --> 00:29:39.090
Jo Eun-su, sir?

00:29:39.883 --> 00:29:41.259
Your turn, sir.

00:29:57.275 --> 00:29:58.276
Welcome, sir.

00:30:16.794 --> 00:30:19.589
This guy used to move boxes
at your warehouse, didn't he?

00:30:20.632 --> 00:30:23.718
He was going off the rails, so I left him
to drink himself into a stupor.

00:30:24.969 --> 00:30:28.806
Guess he came into some money. He could've
just had a drink and called it a night.

00:30:29.307 --> 00:30:32.185
I just redecorated the whole damn place.

00:30:47.241 --> 00:30:49.577
-With that, this should be enough, right?
-Yes, sir.

00:31:32.829 --> 00:31:35.832
He was the kind of kid
who'd save his noodle broth for later,

00:31:35.915 --> 00:31:39.002
but now he's handing out wads
of 50,000-won bills to hostesses.

00:31:39.085 --> 00:31:40.920
He used to call me "sir" out of respect.

00:31:41.004 --> 00:31:43.256
Now that he can buy fancy booze,
it's "Wi."

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.550
Well, I do get it though.

00:31:45.633 --> 00:31:49.512
He said he's landing three billion won,
so blowing cash on liquor must be nothing.

00:31:50.638 --> 00:31:51.472
Three billion?

00:31:51.973 --> 00:31:54.809
According to him,
he's playing these two bitches…

00:31:55.685 --> 00:31:57.645
I mean, two women.

00:31:58.604 --> 00:32:00.940
He says they'll cough up three billion.

00:32:02.859 --> 00:32:05.486
He's obviously either scamming
or blackmailing them.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:11.868
Damn it.

00:32:13.619 --> 00:32:15.121
Mr. Jin.

00:32:21.085 --> 00:32:22.253
The fuck?

00:32:23.087 --> 00:32:26.424
Who do you think you are,
laying your hands on my money?

00:32:37.852 --> 00:32:40.646
You wreck a place,
you pay for the damage, jackass.

00:32:42.857 --> 00:32:43.691
Also,

00:32:44.901 --> 00:32:47.320
looks like you've started doing business.

00:32:48.696 --> 00:32:52.116
What if the cops show up and bust you
for crossing the border illegally?

00:32:54.827 --> 00:32:55.995
Fucking hell.

00:32:56.079 --> 00:32:58.498
Who said I came here illegally?

00:32:58.581 --> 00:33:01.292
I have a passport. I have two, actually.

00:33:01.876 --> 00:33:03.294
Mine and his.

00:33:04.087 --> 00:33:08.049
So get that fucking prick to pay up,
and give me my damn money back.

00:33:11.094 --> 00:33:12.095
Fuck.

00:33:12.762 --> 00:33:13.763
Yeah?

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:20.061
You little…

00:33:27.443 --> 00:33:28.903
Let's talk when you're sober.

00:33:28.986 --> 00:33:30.363
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

00:33:30.446 --> 00:33:31.781
Where the fuck do you think--

00:33:36.994 --> 00:33:38.204
Fucking hell.

00:33:38.704 --> 00:33:40.706
That's for messing with
one of my employees.

00:33:48.548 --> 00:33:50.383
Fuck… Fuck!

00:33:50.925 --> 00:33:52.718
Fuck you!

00:33:53.678 --> 00:33:54.846
Fuck!

00:34:04.939 --> 00:34:06.649
Can you step outside for a moment?

00:34:18.119 --> 00:34:19.120
Hello?

00:34:21.164 --> 00:34:23.207
I'm sorry, boss. I'm still…

00:34:26.544 --> 00:34:29.172
-If anything is going on--
-Nothing is going on.

00:34:33.176 --> 00:34:34.552
If you say so. Sure.

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:39.390
Get some rest and take care of yourself.

00:34:47.315 --> 00:34:49.609
The passcode does not match.

00:35:18.387 --> 00:35:20.264
If someone named Jo Eun-su calls,

00:35:20.348 --> 00:35:22.767
he should assign his best guy to the job.

00:35:24.185 --> 00:35:25.186
Jo Eun-su, sir?

00:35:31.234 --> 00:35:32.068
MS. JO EUN-SU

00:35:50.962 --> 00:35:53.339
She should have killed her damn husband.

00:36:03.057 --> 00:36:05.768
What could they do
if there's no body to find?

00:36:06.852 --> 00:36:10.773
Keep them from knowing you killed him,
or keep them from knowing he's dead.

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.194
That's why
Eun-su dragged Jang Kang into it.

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.825
What about Hui-su's husband, then?

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:23.577
I have a passport.

00:36:23.661 --> 00:36:26.455
I have two, actually. Mine and his.

00:36:26.956 --> 00:36:29.333
Does your husband know
you want a job here?

00:36:29.959 --> 00:36:31.294
We're currently separated.

00:36:43.431 --> 00:36:46.642
Because of what I said…

00:36:50.688 --> 00:36:52.606
Hey, Ma. Have you had dinner?

00:36:53.941 --> 00:36:54.775
Yeah.

00:36:56.485 --> 00:36:58.904
I need you to look into someone.

00:36:59.613 --> 00:37:00.698
A location tracker?

00:37:01.198 --> 00:37:04.493
Luckily, I don't think Jang Kang knows
where Noh Jin-pyo's body is yet.

00:37:05.036 --> 00:37:08.289
We need to get Noh Jin-pyo's phone
before Jang Kang finds out.

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.041
But how?

00:37:15.755 --> 00:37:17.757
I'm the person who called earlier.

00:37:18.674 --> 00:37:20.718
There's a phone I need to retrieve.

00:37:22.219 --> 00:37:25.473
There are eyes everywhere,
so I'll bring you the money. Where to?

00:37:26.182 --> 00:37:28.476
-Call me later.
-Are you near your old place?

00:37:28.559 --> 00:37:30.519
I said fucking call me later!

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:48.788
MANAGER HWANG
(REFERRED BY CHAIRMAN WANG)

00:37:55.002 --> 00:37:57.630
Please begin by searching
the motels in this area.

00:39:13.414 --> 00:39:17.376
MOUNTAIN 1, DAECHI-RI, HYEONBUK-MYEON,
YANGYANG-GUN, GANGWON-DO

00:39:26.927 --> 00:39:29.263
LOCATION TRACKER

00:39:31.724 --> 00:39:34.101
CONNECTION LOST
WOULD YOU LIKE TO RECONNECT?

00:39:34.185 --> 00:39:37.229
NO RECORDED LOCATIONS

00:39:37.313 --> 00:39:38.898
OCTOBER 30

00:39:40.608 --> 00:39:41.609
That afternoon

00:39:43.444 --> 00:39:45.529
would've been the day
before Noh Jin-pyo died.

00:39:49.658 --> 00:39:51.577
What was she doing up in the mountains?

00:39:55.789 --> 00:39:58.626
MOUNTAIN 1, DAECHI-RI

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:02.379
I found the motel.

00:40:02.922 --> 00:40:05.466
But the man just grabbed a cab
and left in a hurry.

00:40:05.966 --> 00:40:07.009
Should I proceed?

00:40:07.092 --> 00:40:08.177
Please do that.

00:40:08.802 --> 00:40:11.388
He just exited at Yangyang
and is headed for Gangneung.

00:40:11.472 --> 00:40:12.723
Should I keep going?

00:40:12.806 --> 00:40:13.641
Yangyang?

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:17.311
No, please stop there.
That's enough for today.

00:40:24.276 --> 00:40:27.196
Ms. Jo wants a phone that Jang Kang has.

00:40:27.696 --> 00:40:30.950
Then she suddenly asked
to stop tailing him on the highway.

00:40:32.076 --> 00:40:34.578
Should I continue to watch him? Jang Kang?

00:40:57.476 --> 00:40:59.061
Without Jo Eun-su finding out.

00:41:28.674 --> 00:41:29.925
Processing your card.

00:41:30.009 --> 00:41:32.928
Processing your card. Please wait.

00:41:33.721 --> 00:41:35.055
Please take your cash.

00:41:45.316 --> 00:41:49.612
Hey, Hui-su. I'm heading out for work,
so I'll be unavailable for a few hours.

00:41:49.695 --> 00:41:51.071
Did you get his phone?

00:41:51.572 --> 00:41:52.948
I think I'll have it soon.

00:41:53.032 --> 00:41:55.576
If Jang Kang calls you today,
don't pick up.

00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:59.079
-But he'll probably call.
-No, don't answer.

00:41:59.163 --> 00:42:00.706
I'll call him once I get back.

00:42:09.006 --> 00:42:10.007
Jo Eun-su.

00:42:10.841 --> 00:42:12.843
Do you know where I am?

00:42:14.345 --> 00:42:15.220
I'm in Yangyang.

00:42:26.065 --> 00:42:27.775
Mount Manwol in Yangyang.

00:42:37.576 --> 00:42:40.788
Noh Jin-pyo, he's here, isn't he?

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.041
For fuck's sake.

00:42:44.958 --> 00:42:46.794
If you've seen it, say something.

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:51.674
What should I say
about an ordinary mountain?

00:42:54.176 --> 00:42:58.180
You did a great job of hiding him
in a mountain with zero reception.

00:42:59.431 --> 00:43:01.892
I'm thinking of bringing a shovel
and some tools

00:43:01.975 --> 00:43:03.435
to do some digging tomorrow.

00:43:04.645 --> 00:43:06.271
Wonder what I'll find.

00:43:09.483 --> 00:43:10.734
Do whatever you want.

00:43:11.568 --> 00:43:14.279
I have the money.
Where do you want to meet?

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:40.764
She seemed desperate for money.
Shame to sell that place so cheap.

00:43:44.184 --> 00:43:47.521
ACE REAL ESTATE

00:43:47.604 --> 00:43:50.482
I added another lock
to my front door just in case.

00:43:50.566 --> 00:43:52.443
Here's the key. Go and wait at my place.

00:43:53.444 --> 00:43:54.945
Let's go together after work.

00:43:56.238 --> 00:43:57.906
I have to work late today.

00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:02.077
We didn't even consider that Jang Kang
could show up here. We got careless.

00:44:02.161 --> 00:44:03.704
I'm not sure I should…

00:44:49.416 --> 00:44:51.418
Are you the new person in charge?

00:44:51.502 --> 00:44:54.588
Manager Hwang has personal matters,
so I'll be taking over your case.

00:44:54.671 --> 00:44:56.924
If you hand Jang Kang over to me,

00:44:57.007 --> 00:45:00.385
I'll make sure he's sent to China
by tomorrow morning.

00:45:00.469 --> 00:45:02.679
I'll be waiting
at the location you shared.

00:45:33.585 --> 00:45:34.503
Jin-pyo?

00:45:42.761 --> 00:45:44.179
It can't be.

00:45:44.263 --> 00:45:45.973
He hasn't returned to Korea yet.

00:45:54.773 --> 00:45:56.149
Are you fucking kidding me?

00:46:02.489 --> 00:46:04.116
This is all you brought?

00:46:04.199 --> 00:46:05.659
She'll load up that bag later.

00:46:11.206 --> 00:46:12.541
How much cash do you have?

00:46:12.624 --> 00:46:13.917
We still need to count it.

00:46:14.001 --> 00:46:18.046
Hui-su found it under the mattress
when she went to sell her mom's house.

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:19.506
It's probably ten times that.

00:46:20.549 --> 00:46:22.551
No wonder she ended up
in a dementia center,

00:46:22.634 --> 00:46:23.844
pulling shit like that.

00:46:27.055 --> 00:46:28.056
How much further?

00:46:28.932 --> 00:46:30.142
Still a while to go.

00:46:41.278 --> 00:46:42.905
INSPECTOR CHOI GYEONG-GU

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.578
Inspector Choi, what is it?

00:46:49.661 --> 00:46:50.621
Right.

00:46:50.704 --> 00:46:54.333
Well, I've been reviewing the materials
related to the security guard case.

00:46:57.377 --> 00:46:58.462
What?

00:46:59.671 --> 00:47:02.883
Right. Well, still hard at work, huh?

00:47:03.383 --> 00:47:04.217
The thing is,

00:47:04.718 --> 00:47:06.511
the dashcam footage from a car

00:47:06.595 --> 00:47:09.306
that passed by
around the time of the incident

00:47:09.932 --> 00:47:13.685
captured your sister-in-law.
The lady I met with you last time.

00:47:15.771 --> 00:47:16.605
What?

00:47:18.482 --> 00:47:20.484
What are you getting at?

00:47:20.567 --> 00:47:23.236
No, I wasn't implying anything.

00:47:23.737 --> 00:47:28.325
I just stumbled on it, and it seemed odd,
so I thought I'd call to check with you.

00:47:29.743 --> 00:47:31.912
Well, I'm driving at the moment.

00:47:32.412 --> 00:47:34.957
Right, sure.
I'll call you later, Jin-young.

00:47:35.707 --> 00:47:36.541
Yes. Goodbye.

00:47:42.965 --> 00:47:46.718
Damn it.
My assignment interview is tomorrow.

00:47:49.805 --> 00:47:51.974
I'll deal with the dashcam footage first.

00:47:55.978 --> 00:47:57.437
MOM

00:47:58.647 --> 00:47:59.773
Mom, I'm busy. I'll--

00:47:59.856 --> 00:48:01.274
Your brother was here.

00:48:06.279 --> 00:48:08.115
They must really be after him.

00:48:08.198 --> 00:48:10.534
He came to see me
but couldn't even get close.

00:48:11.034 --> 00:48:14.162
Anyway, make sure you find your brother
and bring him home

00:48:14.663 --> 00:48:16.957
before his office comes for him.

00:48:17.749 --> 00:48:19.584
These past two days,

00:48:20.085 --> 00:48:22.170
reading his texts
has been breaking my heart.

00:48:22.879 --> 00:48:23.880
Texts?

00:48:28.468 --> 00:48:30.053
MOM, I'M ON THE RUNN

00:48:30.137 --> 00:48:31.596
I'M OUT OF MONEE

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.348
NOONE CAN NO ABOUT THE MONEY OR ME

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:41.481
JIN-PYO

00:48:42.816 --> 00:48:45.485
I'M HAVING DINNER WITH MOM TONIGHT.
YOU CAN MAKE IT, RIGHT?

00:48:48.613 --> 00:48:50.532
Those messages weren't from Jin-pyo.

00:48:55.454 --> 00:48:56.288
Where are we?

00:49:01.585 --> 00:49:02.919
Do we have far to go?

00:49:06.173 --> 00:49:07.007
Hey.

00:49:09.968 --> 00:49:11.678
How much further do we have to go?

00:49:20.979 --> 00:49:21.897
Where are you going?

00:49:32.699 --> 00:49:33.700
Stop the car.

00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:38.205
Fucking stop!

00:49:38.288 --> 00:49:39.998
-Let go!
-You bitch!

00:49:40.082 --> 00:49:41.625
Let go of the steering wheel!

00:49:43.043 --> 00:49:44.377
You fucking… Damn it!

00:49:55.138 --> 00:49:56.306
You fucking bitch.

00:49:56.389 --> 00:49:59.559
Do you want me to fucking end you? Do you?

00:50:00.936 --> 00:50:03.021
Killing one more is no problem at all.

00:50:03.105 --> 00:50:04.981
But what about my fucking money?

00:50:05.982 --> 00:50:07.442
I should kill you once I have it.

00:50:10.654 --> 00:50:11.780
Where are you going?

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:30.048
Where the fuck is this?

00:54:10.602 --> 00:54:15.607
