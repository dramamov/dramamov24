Like, maybe you push a button and then
banana peels fly out onto the track?

Then the drivers will start freaking out.

00:13:09.018 --> 00:13:11.312
They'll crash, or maybe
their cars might explode.

Sir, our new record is 1.3 seconds.

We'll rank at the top this season
for sure.

Isn't it more fun
when there are some accidents, though?

00:13:49.183 --> 00:13:52.603
[chuckles] Uh, if our drivers
were to get hurt on the racetrack,

00:13:52.687 --> 00:13:54.188
then we'd be in serious trouble.

00:13:54.272 --> 00:13:56.149
I thought you were serious about winning.

00:13:56.983 --> 00:13:58.276
We are. We're here to win.

00:13:58.359 --> 00:14:01.237
The whole team has been working hard
and giving their best, just for you, sir.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.657
I doubt you're giving it your all
if you're this worried about accidents.

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:08.327
If you want to be victorious,
you have to be willing to risk everything.

out there

and one of our drivers gets killed,
how would we recover from that?

-It's not a problem, sir.

You don't think their lives
are worth sacrificing.

00:14:30.308 --> 00:14:31.309
We're done here.

00:14:34.228 --> 00:14:36.898

we are no longer your main sponsor.

00:14:36.981 --> 00:14:38.107

Seems I've been focusing
on all the wrong things.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.914
Now I've finally found the real deal.

00:15:34.997 --> 00:15:36.624
I'm glad to hear that.

00:15:36.707 --> 00:15:38.125
May I ask what it is?

00:15:38.876 --> 00:15:40.419

Sounds like fun, right?

00:15:47.802 --> 00:15:50.304
That's exactly what I would expect
from you.

00:15:50.388 --> 00:15:54.058
Which means I need a list of clients
connected to the Ministry of Justice.

00:15:57.645 --> 00:16:00.606
I'll get the list
and bring in a foreign security agency.

00:16:02.358 --> 00:16:05.027
Nanny, you're the only one
who understands my vision.

00:16:37.727 --> 00:16:38.936
What about the study?

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:40.271
Did they seize everything?

00:16:40.354 --> 00:16:41.689
[man on phone] Yes, sir.

00:16:41.772 --> 00:16:43.274
Oh, son of a bitch!

00:16:45.026 --> 00:16:47.403
Just hole up somewhere.
Keep this to yourself.

00:16:47.486 --> 00:16:49.030

-Ah, just tell me later.
-No, he's already later.

00:16:53.159 --> 00:16:55.077
No, I think we'll talk right now.

00:16:55.161 --> 00:16:58.372
-[gasping] Commissioner.
-You look like you're falling apart.

00:16:58.456 --> 00:17:01.542
-Is this job too much for you?
-To what do I owe this surprise visit?

00:17:01.625 --> 00:17:02.752
All of you...

00:17:02.835 --> 00:17:03.961
get out!

00:17:04.045 --> 00:17:05.504
-You, have a seat.
-Yes, sir.

00:17:08.841 --> 00:17:09.842
Hey.

00:17:10.676 --> 00:17:11.802
Hey. What are you doing?

00:17:11.886 --> 00:17:15.598
Wow. Did you get these awards
just for housing all those prisoners?

00:17:15.681 --> 00:17:19.226
-[chuckles] Yes, that's right.
-That's admirable.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:21.270
I thought they were just
a drain on our taxes.

00:17:22.188 --> 00:17:23.856
-Who...
-Oh, this is--

00:17:23.939 --> 00:17:25.900
Why don't you go and drink some coffee?

00:17:25.983 --> 00:17:27.943
Uh, yes. I'll come back later.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:32.865
Listen to me. Whatever this gentleman
orders you to do, don't argue with it.

00:17:32.948 --> 00:17:34.075
Just do it.

00:17:34.617 --> 00:17:35.618
-What?
-I'll go now.

00:17:35.701 --> 00:17:38.496
KOREA CORRECTIONAL SERVICE
GUAN CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION

00:17:38.579 --> 00:17:41.248
I heard you have the most
violent criminals in the country here.

00:17:41.332 --> 00:17:43.167
-Yes, but who are you?
-[door closes]

00:17:49.548 --> 00:17:50.675
Who do you think I am?

00:17:52.551 --> 00:17:54.470
[clears throat] I beg your pardon, sir,

00:17:54.553 --> 00:17:58.224
but may I ask what your relationship is
with the commissioner?

00:17:58.307 --> 00:18:00.059
Oh, none at all.

00:18:00.142 --> 00:18:01.185
I don't really know him.

00:18:01.268 --> 00:18:02.812
[scoffs] What do you mean by that?

00:18:02.895 --> 00:18:04.522
I don't know the Commissioner General,

00:18:04.605 --> 00:18:06.691
but I'm friends with the person
who got him appointed.

00:18:06.774 --> 00:18:08.359
I have many friends, you know.

00:18:08.442 --> 00:18:09.694
Ah, I see.

00:18:11.779 --> 00:18:13.072
So, what brings you here?

00:18:13.155 --> 00:18:17.368
Well, is this awkward for you, having to
show respect to someone younger like me?

00:18:17.451 --> 00:18:19.328
Remember what the commissioner told you.

00:18:19.412 --> 00:18:22.123
[sighs] To take care of you
during your visit.

00:18:23.207 --> 00:18:24.208
That wasn't it.

00:18:27.086 --> 00:18:29.839
The commissioner told me
I should agree to anything you ask.

00:18:29.922 --> 00:18:31.257
That's not what he said.

00:18:35.428 --> 00:18:37.596
He said to do
whatever you ordered me to do.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.432
[chuckles softly]

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:47.523
Take a look at this.

00:18:52.987 --> 00:18:55.656
PROPOSAL FOR
ENVIRONMENTAL VOLUNTEER ACTIVITIES

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.950
Doesn't it sound like a fun idea?

00:18:58.033 --> 00:19:00.327
-Sure. However this is--
-Oh, I almost forgot.

00:19:00.995 --> 00:19:02.997
-How should I say this?
-Here.

00:19:04.707 --> 00:19:07.293
I didn't have time to wrap them.
I was in a hurry today.

00:19:08.502 --> 00:19:10.337
And I don't like to waste time.

00:19:10.421 --> 00:19:13.048
Each is worth 200 million,
if I had to guess,

00:19:13.674 --> 00:19:15.968
I'll give you five more
if all this goes well.

00:19:17.762 --> 00:19:19.263
[scoffs]

00:19:21.515 --> 00:19:23.976
It seems like you've been working
really hard trying to get rich.

00:19:24.059 --> 00:19:26.562
But you use public funds
to invest in crypto

00:19:26.645 --> 00:19:29.356
and bought coins from a bunch
of scammers by mistake.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.483
Right?

00:19:31.484 --> 00:19:33.819
And you left all the money you pocketed
in your study.

00:19:33.903 --> 00:19:35.196
So it was easy to take from you.

00:19:36.322 --> 00:19:37.490
Who told you about that?

00:19:37.573 --> 00:19:41.160
Didn't I already mention?
I have a lot of friends around.

00:19:41.243 --> 00:19:43.829
As for the stuff they confiscated,

00:19:43.913 --> 00:19:45.706
would you like them returned to you?

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:47.416
I can make it happen.

00:19:48.876 --> 00:19:52.004
Or maybe, you care about
these inmates after all.

00:19:52.087 --> 00:19:53.923
No, I don't get attached to the inmates.

00:19:54.006 --> 00:19:55.257
Well, that's good to hear.

00:19:55.341 --> 00:19:56.926
Then you've got nothing to lose.

00:20:01.847 --> 00:20:03.307
This is an opportunity.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.768
You can either agree to it
and become a very rich man,

00:20:05.851 --> 00:20:08.562
or maybe you'll lose everything
and they'll fire you.

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:11.524
-[sighs]
-If you're out, tell me now.

00:20:11.607 --> 00:20:13.734
I'll find someone
to take your place easily.

00:20:13.818 --> 00:20:15.319
Oh, no, I can do it, sir.

00:20:17.905 --> 00:20:19.448
Tell me what you want done.

00:20:21.951 --> 00:20:24.370
[chuckles softly] Now we're talking.

00:20:25.329 --> 00:20:28.332
You can authorize your inmates
for work outside the prison, right?

00:20:28.415 --> 00:20:29.416
Yes, that's right.

00:20:30.501 --> 00:20:32.920
Inmates should be selected
according to the conditions

00:20:33.003 --> 00:20:34.713
listed on the last page of that file.

00:20:38.509 --> 00:20:41.595
Violent offenders,
murderers, robbers, etcetera.

00:20:41.679 --> 00:20:43.138
And if you're short on people,

00:20:43.222 --> 00:20:45.474
anyone who pisses you off
will be just fine.

00:20:45.558 --> 00:20:46.642
We'll take them.

00:20:46.725 --> 00:20:49.061
The game gets interesting
when there's variety.

00:20:49.144 --> 00:20:50.145
You got that?

00:20:51.355 --> 00:20:52.648
Understand?

00:20:53.649 --> 00:20:55.442
Yes, sir. I'll take care of everything.

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:57.778
I'll leave it to you

00:20:59.446 --> 00:21:00.990
-Have a safe trip.
-[door closes]

00:21:01.073 --> 00:21:02.449
[mouse clicking]

00:21:02.533 --> 00:21:04.535
[indistinct chatter outside]

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.748
And grabs a change of clothes...

00:21:11.041 --> 00:21:12.293
at 3:30.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:15.671
[sighs]

00:21:20.217 --> 00:21:21.218
B.

00:21:22.678 --> 00:21:23.679
Zone B, huh?

00:21:27.558 --> 00:21:28.684
[exhales sharply]

00:21:31.061 --> 00:21:34.231
MECHANICAL ROOM

00:21:43.198 --> 00:21:44.283
[grunts]

00:21:50.623 --> 00:21:52.291
[panting]

00:22:04.803 --> 00:22:07.097
[woman speaking indistinctly]

00:22:31.455 --> 00:22:33.999
CIVIL AFFAIRS SERVICE

00:22:49.848 --> 00:22:52.810
MAIN GATE

00:23:00.234 --> 00:23:01.735
[sighs]

00:23:02.736 --> 00:23:04.488
Right out through the main gate.

00:23:06.115 --> 00:23:07.282
[chuckles]

00:23:15.749 --> 00:23:17.668
[Taejoong groans softly]

00:23:20.963 --> 00:23:22.089
Oh, you're awake.

00:23:24.842 --> 00:23:27.136
It's a good thing
that Father found you in time.

00:23:27.219 --> 00:23:29.304
If he found you any later, you'd be dead.

00:23:29.388 --> 00:23:30.931
[gagging]

00:23:35.394 --> 00:23:36.937
[continues gagging]

00:23:37.021 --> 00:23:38.147
Who made you eat it?

00:23:39.273 --> 00:23:40.524
Or did you eat it on purpose?

00:23:41.233 --> 00:23:42.276
What do you mean?

00:23:42.359 --> 00:23:44.570
We found huge amounts of warfarin
in your blood.

00:23:44.653 --> 00:23:47.031
-[groans]
-You swallowed rat poison.

00:23:47.114 --> 00:23:48.741
You know that supplement you took?

00:23:48.824 --> 00:23:51.452
All that Vitamin K3 acted as an antidote.

00:23:51.535 --> 00:23:53.203
It bought you some extra time.

00:23:53.787 --> 00:23:55.622
You should thank whoever got that for you.

00:23:55.706 --> 00:23:57.958
-They ended up saving your life.
-[grunts]

00:24:00.836 --> 00:24:02.421
[groaning]

00:24:10.429 --> 00:24:11.555
[retching]

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:14.183
Park Taejoong.

00:24:15.517 --> 00:24:16.769
[retching]

00:24:18.437 --> 00:24:19.688
You all right?

00:24:21.356 --> 00:24:22.775
[sighs]

00:24:26.278 --> 00:24:27.696
I heard a lot of stories...

00:24:29.615 --> 00:24:32.242
that you went out the main gate
dressed in plain clothes.

00:24:32.326 --> 00:24:34.244
Some are saying it was an escape attempt.

00:24:34.328 --> 00:24:37.623
Others say you collapsed
after eating food mixed with rat poison.

00:24:37.706 --> 00:24:39.458
Who knows what's true?

00:24:39.541 --> 00:24:42.461
[Taejoong groaning]

00:24:42.544 --> 00:24:44.713
I do know that something isn't adding up.

00:24:50.636 --> 00:24:52.971
I don't think
you'd poison yourself like that.

00:24:54.681 --> 00:24:55.849
Someone else did this.

00:24:56.934 --> 00:24:59.019
They must have really wanted
to put you out of commission.

00:25:00.729 --> 00:25:02.940
I should have kept
a closer watch on things.

00:25:03.774 --> 00:25:05.275
I won't let this happen again,

00:25:06.026 --> 00:25:07.027
I promise.

00:25:08.362 --> 00:25:09.363
[grunts]

00:25:09.446 --> 00:25:11.115
And another thing.

00:25:13.367 --> 00:25:14.701
If those rumors are true,

00:25:15.702 --> 00:25:19.289
that you changed clothes,
used the blind spots to reach the gate...

00:25:19.373 --> 00:25:24.628
and even managed to get outside,
escaping does seem possible after all.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:28.090
Nobody ever thinks of
just walking out the front door,

00:25:28.924 --> 00:25:31.218
so I'm sure that's the weakest point here.

00:25:32.928 --> 00:25:34.138
[grunts]

00:25:35.013 --> 00:25:38.559
I treated you too humanely, 2802.

00:25:40.144 --> 00:25:41.854
You think you're too humane?

00:25:45.274 --> 00:25:47.067
Is that your idea of a joke?

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:49.862
Wow.

00:25:52.197 --> 00:25:53.782
I'm really hurt to hear you say that.

00:25:54.658 --> 00:25:57.244
You'd be surprised to hear
what people really think.

00:26:00.455 --> 00:26:03.292
As soon as you recover,
the investigation will start.

00:26:04.835 --> 00:26:06.044
Ah.

00:26:06.962 --> 00:26:09.006
Noh Yongsik requested a visit.

00:26:09.089 --> 00:26:10.132
Maybe some other time.

00:26:10.215 --> 00:26:12.176
Please give him this message.

00:26:14.511 --> 00:26:16.263
Thank you for saving my life again.

00:26:18.473 --> 00:26:20.225
Is that some kind of secret code?

00:26:20.767 --> 00:26:22.186
It's just a word of thanks.

00:26:23.228 --> 00:26:24.313
Anyway...

00:26:25.898 --> 00:26:29.067
out of everyone here,
you probably say thank you the most.

00:26:30.944 --> 00:26:31.945
I guess that means...

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:34.740
you must have been a good man outside.

00:26:37.409 --> 00:26:40.162
[retching]

00:26:40.245 --> 00:26:43.207
You're telling me
Taejoong really said that?

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:45.709
Yes, that was it. Word for word.

00:26:47.377 --> 00:26:50.047
He said,
"Thank you for saving my life again."

00:26:51.215 --> 00:26:53.634
If that's some kind of secret code,
then I don't get it.

00:26:54.885 --> 00:26:57.429
You don't know what it means either, huh?

00:26:57.512 --> 00:26:58.972
Maybe it's not a code at all.

00:27:09.483 --> 00:27:10.859
It was a jailbreak.

00:27:12.277 --> 00:27:13.278
Jailbreak.

00:27:19.451 --> 00:27:20.702
That asshole.

00:27:21.703 --> 00:27:23.705
So that's why he said he was busy.

00:27:23.789 --> 00:27:26.833
Yeah, I heard that the priest
brought him in from outside,

00:27:26.917 --> 00:27:28.126
but the guards are keeping it quiet

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:30.003
because they're scared
of getting reprimanded.

00:27:30.087 --> 00:27:31.213
He was passed out.

00:27:31.296 --> 00:27:33.090
Apparently he ate rat poison.

00:27:33.173 --> 00:27:34.341
Is that for real?

00:27:34.424 --> 00:27:36.843
That's what they said
over at the infirmary.

00:27:36.927 --> 00:27:38.095
So I bet it's true.

00:27:38.178 --> 00:27:40.722
That asshole tried to escape
while he was dying?

00:27:40.806 --> 00:27:42.057
[men chuckle]

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:45.018

Right now, I'm sure he's up to something.
