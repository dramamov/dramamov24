I did meet with Wut, Than.

It didn't occur to me
that my dad would kill him.

Are you asking me
to report my own father to the police?

I know you can't bring yourself to do it.

the world won't become better, Than.
Villains will be evil all the same.

I didn't expect you to care so much about
the life of a lowly employee like me.

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:10.060
If you were just an ordinary bodyguard,

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.140
Pheem wouldn't keep you close to him.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.060
I bet...

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:25.420
you know much about Pheem, right?

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:31.790
You used to be a cop, didn't you?

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:33.460
Hmm?

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:34.260
Humph.

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:38.860
You had to adapt to many things
when you started working with Pheem, huh?

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:41.590
Have you settled in yet?

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.140
Not really.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.860
A cop's mindset
has become second nature to me.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:48.820
Hmm.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:52.580
I find it abhorrent,
when I see people violate the law.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.580
I'd like to do something about it.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:55.380
Hmm.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.980
If Pheem were the offender,

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.140
you'd still have the guts to interfere?

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.740
Not only Pheem, Mr. Thanet.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.560
I'd even be gutsy enough to fight you,
if you committed crimes.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:13.700
Good.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:16.940
How brave of you.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.740
Now, this is fun.

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:27.540
Get well soon.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.620
Can you put in a word for me with Than?

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.820
What else is there to say, Pheem?
We've made it all clear.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.220
Just tell him to understand what I did.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.540
How is he supposed to understand that?
You shot him.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:11.900
I know, Auntie.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:15.860
But can you just do me a favor?

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:18.300
Can you, Mrs. Nit?

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.620
I hope for Than to forgive me

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.780
and to give me a second chance.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.540
I won't hurt him again.

This is Thanavej's new core project.

It's also the future of our empire.

I believe you'll reach great heights.

I heard

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.900
your bodyguard got shot, didn't he?

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:24.100
Dad owns this hospital. He's certainly
entitled to know everything here.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.100
It doesn't matter how I found it out.

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:28.900
The important thing

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.420
is to figure out
what exactly happened to your bodyguard.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.660
It was just a small accident, Dad.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.500
Than was the guy who stood by your side

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.360
and helped you
when you fought your brother, right?

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.420
He seems to know many affairs
of our hospital.

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.100
Actually, he doesn't know much.

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.300
Dad, don't worry.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:59.620
I can have him under control.

Pheem.

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:11.420
Sometimes, love makes us weak.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.820
But the successor to Thanavej

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.140
must not be weak.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.740
I know it has cost you a lot
to finally come this far.

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.220
And this is the last step.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:34.020
It's the ultimate test where you prove

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.940
whether you deserve
to be the successor or not.

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.540
You know what I mean, right?
