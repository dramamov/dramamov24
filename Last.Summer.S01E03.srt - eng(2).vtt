There's not a single soul here.

00:00:54.784 --> 00:00:56.452
It's just the two of us.

00:00:59.914 --> 00:01:02.083
You can see it
even though it's not nighttime.

00:01:02.167 --> 00:01:04.043
The Summer Triangle.

00:01:04.544 --> 00:01:06.754
It's the Winter Triangle.

00:01:10.216 --> 00:01:12.385
Sunrise over sunset.

00:01:14.554 --> 00:01:16.055
Winter…

00:01:16.973 --> 00:01:18.016
over summer.

00:01:20.393 --> 00:01:22.520
How did you know I wanted to come here?

00:01:23.855 --> 00:01:25.356
I know everything.

00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:29.944
Actually…

00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:35.325
if you don't really tell me,
I won't know everything.

00:01:39.245 --> 00:01:40.163
So…

00:01:40.914 --> 00:01:42.498
when are you going to tell me?

00:01:59.891 --> 00:02:01.100
I like someone.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.988
I still regret my confession…

00:02:17.325 --> 00:02:19.244
that day.

00:02:22.372 --> 00:02:23.873
I knew this would happen.

00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:28.378
From the moment you showed up,
I knew it.

00:02:31.965 --> 00:02:33.675
It's always like this with you.

00:02:34.676 --> 00:02:36.511
I'm barely holding it together.

00:02:37.095 --> 00:02:39.430
I'm trying to hold it together,
but when I see you…

00:02:39.514 --> 00:02:41.057
What?

00:02:45.144 --> 00:02:46.396
We need to end this…

00:02:48.022 --> 00:02:49.607
get out of each other's life.

00:02:54.237 --> 00:02:56.114
You said that two years ago.

00:03:05.873 --> 00:03:07.125
Hey, Song Ha-gyeong.

00:03:09.544 --> 00:03:10.795
Do you know why I'm back?

00:03:14.048 --> 00:03:17.260
I want to try getting through
that unbearable summer with you.

00:03:21.514 --> 00:03:22.640
That's why I came back.

00:03:23.808 --> 00:03:24.892
I'm not leaving.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.437
I'm not leaving.

00:03:35.653 --> 00:03:36.654
Then what?

00:03:38.448 --> 00:03:39.449
I'll stay with you.

00:03:45.663 --> 00:03:47.415
Today made me even more certain.

00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:50.793
I need to be by your side.

00:03:55.256 --> 00:03:56.966
You couldn't even toss this box.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.635
What were you thinking,
staying here all this time?

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.223
I want to stay here and find out.

00:04:05.975 --> 00:04:08.269
It'll be hard for you to see me.
I know,

00:04:08.353 --> 00:04:09.228
but…

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.024
if not, you won't even talk to me.

00:04:16.652 --> 00:04:18.946
You never contacted me…

00:04:21.157 --> 00:04:22.241
or tried to find me.

00:04:23.785 --> 00:04:25.286
Don't you know why?

00:04:32.293 --> 00:04:34.003
BAEK DO-YOUNG

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.055
Are you really gonna live here with me?

00:04:45.556 --> 00:04:47.892
Who do you think you are?
What gives you the right?

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.522
No, you never had any rights
to this house.

00:04:53.564 --> 00:04:55.733
If anyone does, it's certainly not you.

00:06:03.551 --> 00:06:05.261
Under tonight's clear night sky,

00:06:05.344 --> 00:06:09.557
you'll be able to clearly see
the Summer Triangle.

00:06:09.682 --> 00:06:12.435
The three brightest stars
in the summer night sky

00:06:12.518 --> 00:06:14.979
are called the Summer Triangle.

00:06:15.605 --> 00:06:17.607
It looks like a constellation,

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.194
but this triangle
is actually Altair from Aquila,

00:06:21.277 --> 00:06:24.488
Vega from Lyra,
and Deneb from Cygnus.

00:06:24.572 --> 00:06:28.201
These three constellations
are grouped together.

00:06:28.284 --> 00:06:31.829
Tonight after the early rainy season,
please look up and see this…

00:06:45.718 --> 00:06:47.637
You'll catch a cold if you go out.

00:06:48.137 --> 00:06:49.347
On the table.

00:06:50.556 --> 00:06:52.642
MEDICINE

00:06:55.811 --> 00:06:59.273
On unlucky days,
other misfortunes follow.

00:07:01.025 --> 00:07:02.235
A flood,

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.987
and news I don't want to hear.

00:07:05.947 --> 00:07:07.198
But it's okay.

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:09.200
My summers…

00:07:10.952 --> 00:07:12.286
have always been like this.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.221
Yes.

00:07:31.264 --> 00:07:33.391
You're talking about that greenhouse?

00:07:33.474 --> 00:07:37.144
Yes, I know which one it is.
Yes, I'll head over right away.

00:07:37.895 --> 00:07:40.523
-What's all this?
-Combat uniform.

00:07:40.606 --> 00:07:42.733
-Put them on. We need to go.
-Me too?

00:07:44.777 --> 00:07:47.989
I want to try getting through
that unbearable summer with you.

00:07:49.448 --> 00:07:50.825
I need to be by your side.

00:07:52.076 --> 00:07:53.828
-Why?
-What?

00:07:53.911 --> 00:07:56.205
Did your house get flooded badly too?

00:07:56.914 --> 00:07:58.666
No, nothing like that.

00:07:59.375 --> 00:08:00.418
Hey.

00:08:01.294 --> 00:08:03.713
You need to wear a nose plug. It's a must.

00:08:05.506 --> 00:08:08.009
Why is this a must?

00:08:10.011 --> 00:08:12.638
So the property damage is…

00:08:13.222 --> 00:08:15.850
-Three iron bars collapsed.
-Yes.

00:08:15.933 --> 00:08:19.103
-And you lost two cows.
-Yes.

00:08:19.562 --> 00:08:21.606
Officer Song!

00:08:24.025 --> 00:08:25.901
Officer Song!

00:08:28.613 --> 00:08:30.865
What's this? No!

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:33.451
-Sir.
-Officer Song.

00:08:34.118 --> 00:08:35.411
Get ready. Let's go!

00:08:39.457 --> 00:08:40.499
Good boy, right?

00:08:42.376 --> 00:08:44.879
-Good boy, right?
-No.

00:08:44.962 --> 00:08:47.298
Try at least one. That's how you learn.

00:08:52.845 --> 00:08:53.721
Hey, go home.

00:08:54.472 --> 00:08:57.808
They didn't teach me this
when I studied for the exam.

00:08:57.892 --> 00:08:58.768
Go home!

00:09:07.318 --> 00:09:09.654
Mom, why'd you tell me to take the exam?

00:09:10.196 --> 00:09:12.573
You don't know it's flooding in Pacheon,
do you?

00:09:13.908 --> 00:09:18.412
I can't eat, I just caught pigs.
I'm dying from the smell!

00:09:21.874 --> 00:09:22.792
You're here?

00:09:23.292 --> 00:09:26.629
Chief Shin,
are you sure one is enough?

00:09:26.712 --> 00:09:29.131
It's fine. There are many people…

00:09:30.716 --> 00:09:31.759
-Dr. Song.
-Yes.

00:09:31.842 --> 00:09:33.678
-You went to the pig farm?
-Yes.

00:09:33.761 --> 00:09:36.847
The smell is just…

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:40.434
Is it that bad?
There are a lot of pig farms.

00:09:41.602 --> 00:09:42.436
Hey!

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.815
What, even Dr. Song is here?

00:09:46.565 --> 00:09:48.776
What do these bookworms know?

00:09:48.859 --> 00:09:50.861
I graduated from being
a bookworm a while ago.

00:09:51.404 --> 00:09:53.239
I even fixed Seul's grandpa's roof myself.

00:09:53.322 --> 00:09:55.449
That old man's still alive?

00:09:55.533 --> 00:09:57.326
Yes, fortunately.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:00.454
Someone came
and did a thorough job waterproofing it.

00:10:00.538 --> 00:10:02.581
If you're curious, why don't you call?

00:10:02.665 --> 00:10:06.961
Forget it. When he dies,
I'll decide whether or not to pay a visit.

00:10:07.044 --> 00:10:10.548
You go ahead. I'm fine here alone.

00:10:11.215 --> 00:10:12.717
Your house has problems too.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.260
Chairman, it's okay.

00:10:16.554 --> 00:10:17.722
Just a moment.

00:10:21.183 --> 00:10:22.226
SEO SU-HYEOK

00:10:22.309 --> 00:10:25.521
The date for the mediation hearing
has been set. July 7th.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.121
You're here?

00:10:42.621 --> 00:10:45.916
Looks like you pulled an all-nighter.
Five new bird cages.

00:10:49.003 --> 00:10:52.506
Now you really know everything about me.

00:10:58.095 --> 00:11:01.015
I booked a date
for the mediation hearing with Ms. Song.

00:11:01.098 --> 00:11:04.268
I'd like to recommend
a settlement before mediation,

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.520
but you won't want that, right?

00:11:08.689 --> 00:11:10.983
So, you're choosing to be the defendant?

00:11:11.066 --> 00:11:12.276
TWO MONTHS AGO

00:11:12.359 --> 00:11:16.155
The complaint isn't even filed.
There's not even a plaintiff yet.

00:11:16.739 --> 00:11:18.532
She'll definitely contact us in a month.

00:11:19.074 --> 00:11:22.119
I know
what Ha-gyeong's weakness is.

00:11:22.203 --> 00:11:25.164
So you're saying… it's okay if we lose?

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:26.874
Yes.

00:11:28.667 --> 00:11:30.002
What are you fighting for?

00:11:30.085 --> 00:11:32.046
Just protect the peanut house.

00:11:32.796 --> 00:11:37.426
So drag it out
until the end of this summer.

00:11:40.429 --> 00:11:42.223
No matter how I look at it,

00:11:42.306 --> 00:11:46.227
you two are very different
from the people I met in court.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:48.395
You're pretty unique yourself.

00:11:54.735 --> 00:11:58.030
Why are you both
so obsessed with the peanut house?

00:12:00.366 --> 00:12:04.453
You know what?
A home shows the people in it.

00:12:05.663 --> 00:12:07.540
If it's empty, we don't call it a home.

00:12:08.707 --> 00:12:10.084
It's just a building.

00:12:10.751 --> 00:12:13.420
It becomes a home
only when someone lives there.

00:12:14.213 --> 00:12:18.050
A real home has footprints, scuff marks,
and a few damages.

00:12:18.759 --> 00:12:20.219
That's what makes it a home.

00:12:21.095 --> 00:12:24.682
So when you look at a home,
you can see how someone has lived

00:12:25.224 --> 00:12:26.642
and how they'll keep living.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:31.647
Just by looking at it,
you can get a sense of their personality,

00:12:32.273 --> 00:12:36.318
habits, job, tastes, to some extent.

00:12:39.446 --> 00:12:40.489
Pretty scary, right?

00:12:42.658 --> 00:12:43.534
It is scary.

00:12:44.159 --> 00:12:46.245
Director Baek,
don't ever come to my place.

00:12:49.331 --> 00:12:50.833
As I mentioned before,

00:12:51.917 --> 00:12:55.671
between Korea and the US,
I've moved more than ten times…

00:12:56.463 --> 00:13:00.092
but there was only one place
that I considered to be my home.

00:13:03.971 --> 00:13:05.431
I've seen the defendant enough.

00:13:06.098 --> 00:13:08.309
Now I need to dig into the plaintiff.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.771
Mr. Baek, what do you plan to do next?

00:13:12.855 --> 00:13:13.897
So dirty.

00:13:13.981 --> 00:13:15.232
-Gross.
-What's this?

00:13:15.316 --> 00:13:17.151
-So gross.
-Why'd you go out?

00:13:17.234 --> 00:13:18.736
Why'd you go out?

00:13:24.575 --> 00:13:28.078
-For flood recovery.
-No ginseng this time, Ms. Song?

00:13:28.579 --> 00:13:30.372
Didn't you see the wild ginseng?

00:13:30.914 --> 00:13:31.999
The situation is a bit…

00:13:32.541 --> 00:13:35.878
The buyers are already considering
other places.

00:13:35.961 --> 00:13:37.963
What should I do about this now?

00:13:38.047 --> 00:13:42.468
I'm sorry, sir. I'll call you right back.

00:13:45.471 --> 00:13:48.474
Is the peanut house flood bad?
You keep getting calls.

00:13:48.557 --> 00:13:52.061
Chief, I need to take a half-day leave.

00:13:52.811 --> 00:13:55.564
-You can't. Headquarters wants you.
-Why?

00:13:56.273 --> 00:13:57.358
About the fence project?

00:13:57.441 --> 00:14:00.653
No, it's about the public competition
from headquarters.

00:14:00.736 --> 00:14:02.321
The Patan High remodeling?

00:14:03.238 --> 00:14:06.200
They need you
since you're in charge of that area.

00:14:06.283 --> 00:14:09.536
You're from the last graduating class
before it closed, right?

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:12.748
Wrap this up and hurry over.
They want you there by 1:00 p.m.

00:14:13.749 --> 00:14:15.918
-It's 12:30 now.
-Yeah, so hurry.

00:14:16.001 --> 00:14:18.212
If you leave now, you'll make it.

00:14:18.295 --> 00:14:19.755
If you take that for a spin…

00:14:21.632 --> 00:14:23.634
PACHEON, A HAPPY CITY
WHERE NATURE BREATHES

00:14:28.973 --> 00:14:32.476
By the way, do you smell cow manure?

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.066
I can't stand it.

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:41.110
Where are you going?

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.751
You called for me?

00:14:59.169 --> 00:15:01.547
Oh, my, what's this?

00:15:05.009 --> 00:15:08.470
Even the mayor is attending today.
You look way too casual.

00:15:09.805 --> 00:15:12.182
I've completed my morning duties.

00:15:12.266 --> 00:15:16.270
This is the biggest public competition
in the past five years.

00:15:16.353 --> 00:15:18.355
The budget is 12 billion won.

00:15:18.439 --> 00:15:20.107
And the mayor has special attention.

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:21.400
PATAN OBSERVATORY PROJECT

00:15:21.483 --> 00:15:23.902
You just need to answer a few questions
during Q&A.

00:15:24.611 --> 00:15:26.196
But don't overdo it.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:31.243
DESIGN BASED ON THE SUMMER TRIANGLE

00:15:33.954 --> 00:15:37.708
It's about renovating
the closed Patan High into an observatory.

00:15:37.791 --> 00:15:38.834
He's from New York.

00:15:38.917 --> 00:15:40.002
ARCHITECT: BAEK DO-HA

00:15:40.085 --> 00:15:43.380
So they want to hear
from a veteran like you, Officer Song.

00:15:46.091 --> 00:15:46.925
Here he comes.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.435
-Hello.
-Say hello.

00:15:57.019 --> 00:16:01.899
This is Director Baek from Pluto Atelier
who'll be handling this project.

00:16:01.982 --> 00:16:04.693
This is Officer Song Ha-gyeong
who is in charge of Patan High.

00:16:07.321 --> 00:16:08.322
Officer Song.

00:16:09.281 --> 00:16:11.366
Nice to meet you. I'm Baek Do-ha.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:18.040
When you think of abandoned schools,
what's the first thing you feel?

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.417
Fear, right?

00:16:20.501 --> 00:16:22.669
Fear. That could be it.

00:16:23.378 --> 00:16:25.172
Like how the King Sejong statue moved,

00:16:25.255 --> 00:16:28.050
or the pages of the reading girl statue
flipped by themselves.

00:16:28.801 --> 00:16:31.053
There are so many ghost tales.

00:16:31.136 --> 00:16:35.849
These days, it's normal for influencers
to visit abandoned schools or houses.

00:16:37.101 --> 00:16:37.976
But for me…

00:16:39.228 --> 00:16:41.563
I want to see something.

00:16:50.155 --> 00:16:51.782
I want to look at the stars.

00:17:12.553 --> 00:17:14.221
In a place that no one visits anymore…

00:17:15.222 --> 00:17:19.184
where no one expects anything,
I want to show people the stars there.

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:23.689
It feels like you could tear it down
since no one's there anymore,

00:17:23.772 --> 00:17:27.025
but I want to show
that the stars have always been there.

00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:35.701
The observatory renovation concept
is themed after the Summer Triangle.

00:17:36.785 --> 00:17:39.705
There will be three halls:

00:17:39.788 --> 00:17:42.291
Altair Hall, Vega Hall, and Deneb Hall.

00:17:45.335 --> 00:17:47.421
Any more questions?

00:17:49.381 --> 00:17:50.299
Officer Song…

00:17:51.842 --> 00:17:55.095
you came all the way from Patan
for this presentation.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:59.683
As the one overseeing Patan High,
is there anything you'd like to suggest?

00:18:00.642 --> 00:18:01.476
Me?

00:18:08.609 --> 00:18:09.484
Yes.

00:18:11.069 --> 00:18:13.447
I'm Song Ha-gyeong
from Patan-myeon Office.

00:18:22.956 --> 00:18:23.916
Well…

00:18:26.168 --> 00:18:29.171
who would want an observatory like this?

00:18:30.422 --> 00:18:32.382
Patan-myeon in Pacheon-si

00:18:32.466 --> 00:18:36.011
is a place where communication
with the residents is crucial.

00:18:37.387 --> 00:18:40.766
Out of its 13,000 residents,
more than half went to Patan High.

00:18:41.683 --> 00:18:44.478
Furthermore, if an outsider
with American sensibilities

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:49.233
came to a school full of their memories
and turned it into an observatory,

00:18:50.192 --> 00:18:51.235
who would welcome that?

00:18:51.735 --> 00:18:55.155
I don't think this is a project
to be taken lightly. Thank you.

00:18:56.114 --> 00:18:57.157
If it were true…

00:18:58.659 --> 00:19:01.119
there'd be no scope
for development in Patan.

00:19:02.955 --> 00:19:04.957
As a public servant,

00:19:05.666 --> 00:19:08.585
do you have no desire
to promote development in the village?

00:19:09.878 --> 00:19:10.712
I'm different.

00:19:11.713 --> 00:19:14.716
I've successfully completed
several projects in Patan-myeon.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.343
I'm not an outsider like you,

00:19:16.426 --> 00:19:19.972
and as the last graduate of Patan High,
the residents trust me…

00:19:26.395 --> 00:19:28.939
So what you're saying is
that you're the expert,

00:19:29.022 --> 00:19:31.191
so we should work together?
Is that it?

00:19:32.734 --> 00:19:34.695
You're a Patan High graduate,

00:19:34.778 --> 00:19:38.115
the local official
in charge of Suhyeon-ri in Patan,

00:19:38.198 --> 00:19:40.701
a local who can manage
the residents' complaints,

00:19:40.784 --> 00:19:44.496
and you've successfully completed
every project you've taken on.

00:19:47.082 --> 00:19:50.752
It sounds like local sentiment
plays a crucial role in this project.

00:19:51.795 --> 00:19:55.173
Then I should get a proper look
at Patan and Patan High.

00:19:55.716 --> 00:19:59.136
Officer Song, from the last graduating
class and in charge of the area…

00:20:01.471 --> 00:20:03.890
could you show me around?

00:20:16.903 --> 00:20:20.032
This is too much.
What are you trying to do?

00:20:20.115 --> 00:20:22.534
This isn't a joke.
I spent a year on this project.

00:20:23.869 --> 00:20:26.913
So, as expected, it's not a coincidence?

00:20:28.206 --> 00:20:29.249
No way.

00:20:33.003 --> 00:20:34.338
Is it guilt?

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.676
What guilt?

00:20:42.929 --> 00:20:44.139
Baek Do-young.

00:20:45.474 --> 00:20:48.018
Why should I feel guilty
because of my brother?

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.397
You mean we should build
the observatory he wanted.

00:20:54.066 --> 00:20:55.442
We made a promise.

00:20:57.819 --> 00:20:59.613
Dr. Song, what are you doing out there?

00:21:00.405 --> 00:21:03.658
-Yes, let's go in.
-Hurry up. Let's go.

00:21:11.458 --> 00:21:12.542
Well…

00:21:17.422 --> 00:21:22.010
Judging by all this stuff left behind,
it seems the school closed suddenly.

00:21:22.094 --> 00:21:24.346
It was chaos.

00:21:24.429 --> 00:21:29.434
Students called the education office,
tipping off the media…

00:21:29.518 --> 00:21:30.894
Right.

00:21:30.977 --> 00:21:35.065
Dr. Song here made the biggest fuss.

00:21:36.775 --> 00:21:40.195
For a closed school,
there are a lot of recent snack bags.

00:21:40.278 --> 00:21:43.115
Around July, for Confession Day,

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.159
a bunch of fools come up to the roof
to look at the stars.

00:21:46.243 --> 00:21:47.327
"Confession Day?"

00:21:48.995 --> 00:21:54.042
Dr. Song is the expert on that.
It's all because of her.

00:21:55.127 --> 00:21:58.463
A superstition started
that if you confessed under those stars,

00:21:58.547 --> 00:22:01.383
you'd stay together forever.

00:22:01.466 --> 00:22:05.053
We had to stand guard all the time.
It was crazy.

00:22:05.679 --> 00:22:09.266
The school shut down the following year.

00:22:13.353 --> 00:22:14.479
The name is still there.

00:22:18.567 --> 00:22:20.610
DENEB

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.115
Is it okay to name a club
after a short-lived star?

00:22:25.949 --> 00:22:29.035
That's why it's better.
Living short but bright.

00:22:29.703 --> 00:22:32.038
Dying in a supernova is cool too.

00:22:32.122 --> 00:22:36.084
But what if we live up to the name?
You want the school to close?

00:22:36.168 --> 00:22:37.210
That's no happening.

00:22:39.671 --> 00:22:43.633
DENEB

00:22:45.427 --> 00:22:46.887
Should we go in?

00:22:54.936 --> 00:22:56.229
Deneb?

00:22:56.313 --> 00:22:59.107
Then what's our club name,
the Magpie Bridge?

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.485
My love life isn't working out.

00:23:03.528 --> 00:23:05.155
That's why I said

00:23:05.697 --> 00:23:09.659
if you confess under the Summer Triangle
on July 7th…

00:23:10.285 --> 00:23:12.996
-If you confess?
-You'll never break up.

00:23:15.123 --> 00:23:17.500
Then we're definitely
stargazing that day.

00:23:18.585 --> 00:23:21.421
-Everyone, gather around!
-Stop spreading superstitions!

00:23:22.464 --> 00:23:24.674
Hey, what's a Korean high schooler
supposed to do?

00:23:24.758 --> 00:23:26.635
I don't know! Ha-gyeong.

00:23:27.844 --> 00:23:30.305
Everyone meet up on July 7th. We have to.

00:23:36.478 --> 00:23:37.395
Officer Song.

00:23:44.611 --> 00:23:45.570
Yes.

00:23:46.321 --> 00:23:49.866
Since we're here, please look around.
I'll head back now.

00:23:57.666 --> 00:23:58.750
Let's go in.

00:24:09.052 --> 00:24:10.095
LIBRA

00:24:13.682 --> 00:24:14.766
Isn't this you?

00:24:17.018 --> 00:24:20.313
You went to this school?
That's amazing.

00:24:21.314 --> 00:24:22.899
Want to see something more amazing?

00:24:36.788 --> 00:24:37.998
What's this?

00:24:39.332 --> 00:24:40.250
Ventilation hole.

00:24:41.167 --> 00:24:44.879
Old classroom floors were all wood,
so these were for ventilation.

00:24:46.631 --> 00:24:50.343
Students used them as secret storage too.

00:25:16.453 --> 00:25:18.830
ALTAIR - DENEB - VEGA

00:25:25.462 --> 00:25:28.173
BAEK DO-YOUNG

00:25:28.256 --> 00:25:30.050
This is why I didn't want to open it.

00:25:30.592 --> 00:25:31.843
In this box…

00:25:32.844 --> 00:25:35.805
all the past memories remain intact.

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:10.507
Baek Do-young?

00:26:26.106 --> 00:26:27.899
Okay, done.

00:26:30.235 --> 00:26:31.486
What are you doing?

00:26:32.028 --> 00:26:34.614
The flood made a mess, so I'm fixing it.

00:26:35.281 --> 00:26:36.699
Are you okay, though?

00:27:02.934 --> 00:27:04.269
You scared me!

00:27:04.978 --> 00:27:05.854
What are you doing?

00:27:07.772 --> 00:27:08.773
Mind your own business!

00:27:09.983 --> 00:27:13.278
And don't fix anything.
Just leave it alone.

00:27:13.778 --> 00:27:16.573
Do nothing? Leave it like this?

00:27:16.656 --> 00:27:17.949
Yeah, leave it.

00:27:18.658 --> 00:27:20.785
There's nothing precious here to fix.

00:27:22.162 --> 00:27:23.746
Who falls for that?

00:27:24.873 --> 00:27:26.875
You couldn't throw anything away?

00:27:28.626 --> 00:27:30.920
No. What do you know?

00:27:31.004 --> 00:27:32.964
What's precious to you
is precious to me too.

00:27:34.466 --> 00:27:36.593
So what's precious to me
is precious to you too.

00:27:37.802 --> 00:27:40.597
That's why you couldn't throw
anything from the box.

00:27:46.686 --> 00:27:49.147
But you're not leaving
the house again, right?

00:27:54.944 --> 00:27:55.904
Me?

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:58.490
Why would I leave my house?

00:27:58.573 --> 00:28:02.410
Exactly. Don't do that. You're not a kid.

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:21.846
Baek Do-young?

00:28:39.739 --> 00:28:41.449
As for the Haneul assault case,

00:28:41.991 --> 00:28:44.494
it's his first offense,
so he'll get probation.

00:28:46.204 --> 00:28:49.624
As for Daemyeong divorce case,
he has an account in Panama.

00:28:50.208 --> 00:28:53.253
Use that as leverage for custody,
and we can skip the appeals.

00:28:56.256 --> 00:28:57.757
Both are too boring for me.

00:28:57.841 --> 00:29:00.468
-Are you a lawyer for fun?
-Yes.

00:29:00.552 --> 00:29:01.386
CEO SEO NA-HYEON

00:29:01.469 --> 00:29:04.097
Are you sulking?

00:29:05.098 --> 00:29:06.432
Another issue with Su-chan?

00:29:06.516 --> 00:29:07.892
Do I look like a kid?

00:29:09.227 --> 00:29:12.438
Cleaning up after you guys is getting old.

00:29:13.314 --> 00:29:15.733
I want to focus on my current case.

00:29:16.943 --> 00:29:18.152
The peanut house?

00:29:19.028 --> 00:29:20.822
The property partition suit?

00:29:20.905 --> 00:29:24.409
Yes. There's more room to interpret this.

00:29:24.993 --> 00:29:26.578
-It's quite interesting.
-Really?

00:29:27.078 --> 00:29:29.831
Want something more interesting?

00:29:31.374 --> 00:29:32.750
Seo Su-hyeok's paternity suit.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.087
There it is, your classic move.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:39.007
What, you want me to dig up Dad's grave
and pull a tooth?

00:29:40.383 --> 00:29:42.719
Boss, if you don't feed a dog--

00:29:42.802 --> 00:29:44.888
-It'll bite its owner?
-No.

00:29:45.763 --> 00:29:47.140
It'll eat whatever's around.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.895
Why would it bite the owner?
To get itself put down?

00:29:52.562 --> 00:29:55.440
But the stuff I picked up randomly
turned out to be pretty fun.

00:29:55.523 --> 00:29:59.110
I'll do my best on the peanut house.

00:30:00.987 --> 00:30:02.488
So don't look for me.

00:30:09.245 --> 00:30:13.541
This place is a total mess.
The basement is insane.

00:30:15.084 --> 00:30:18.087
What's Baek Do-ha's deal?
He sets everything up,

00:30:18.963 --> 00:30:21.799
but somehow,
you're the one always reaching out.

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:23.676
You're the desperate one.

00:30:24.719 --> 00:30:28.765
He switched the house title to his name,
claimed all the rights,

00:30:29.599 --> 00:30:31.809
then just sat there,
waiting for you to call.

00:30:32.644 --> 00:30:35.229
If he won the bid
for the Patan High project,

00:30:35.313 --> 00:30:38.066
that means
he's prepared for at least a year.

00:30:39.359 --> 00:30:41.069
What's his deal?

00:30:41.653 --> 00:30:43.237
Did he say anything else?

00:30:44.405 --> 00:30:47.533
I'm not leaving. I'm not getting out.

00:30:48.701 --> 00:30:49.869
What happened again?

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:14.102
He's in amazing shape.

00:31:15.353 --> 00:31:16.938
Birds of a feather.

00:31:17.563 --> 00:31:21.567
Right, no wonder
he's defending Baek Do-ha.

00:31:21.651 --> 00:31:24.195
Don't be so cynical.

00:31:24.278 --> 00:31:26.364
-He's totally your type.
-Are you crazy?

00:31:29.659 --> 00:31:33.913
Hey, who in their right mind
would date a woman who sued their client?

00:31:34.455 --> 00:31:35.999
Actually, there are quite a few.

00:31:40.003 --> 00:31:41.337
I'll be going now.

00:31:42.714 --> 00:31:45.675
Take good care of Ha-gyeong.

00:31:46.843 --> 00:31:50.638
Have a good time, you two.

00:31:53.391 --> 00:31:54.934
I'm off.

00:31:56.102 --> 00:31:56.978
Bye.

00:31:59.564 --> 00:32:02.108
You checked everything?
You can leave then.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:04.861
That's what he meant.

00:32:05.737 --> 00:32:06.612
What?

00:32:06.696 --> 00:32:08.573
Mr. Baek says,
by looking at someone's home,

00:32:08.656 --> 00:32:10.825
you can tell what kind of person they are.

00:32:11.784 --> 00:32:13.453
It really tells a lot.

00:32:14.412 --> 00:32:15.246
Excuse me?

00:32:15.329 --> 00:32:18.458
Actually, I came to ask you something.

00:32:19.459 --> 00:32:23.379
I spent last night
going through your 50-page notice.

00:32:23.463 --> 00:32:25.048
I couldn't fall asleep.

00:32:26.132 --> 00:32:27.175
The more I read it,

00:32:27.258 --> 00:32:29.886
the more I couldn't tell
if you wanted sell the house

00:32:30.511 --> 00:32:32.555
or wanted me to stop you.
It's really unclear.

00:32:33.514 --> 00:32:35.099
What are you saying?

00:32:35.183 --> 00:32:36.642
This morning, I had my answer.

00:32:37.685 --> 00:32:39.520
It all came down to one line.

00:32:42.273 --> 00:32:43.483
Ms. Song.

00:32:44.192 --> 00:32:46.069
You like Mr. Baek that much?

00:32:46.152 --> 00:32:49.197
It reads like you like him so much,
you keep thinking of him,

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.742
so you want to leave this house.

00:32:52.825 --> 00:32:53.993
Have you lost your mind?

00:32:56.037 --> 00:32:59.540
I make money separating truth from lies.

00:33:00.208 --> 00:33:04.128
Though I earn double
making lies undetectable.

00:33:05.463 --> 00:33:08.424
So what's your real feeling?

00:33:11.427 --> 00:33:14.347
I want to sell the house.
Nothing more, nothing less.

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:17.058
It's not fake or real. It's the truth.

00:33:17.809 --> 00:33:19.894
I just want to leave this peanut house.

00:33:24.398 --> 00:33:26.943
Understood. I'll be going.

00:33:31.447 --> 00:33:33.991
Are you still curious
why I took this case?

00:33:34.075 --> 00:33:34.951
Yes.

00:33:35.034 --> 00:33:37.829
Baek Do-ha promised
to eat with me ten times.

00:33:38.538 --> 00:33:41.541
I'm an outcast at home and work.

00:33:42.792 --> 00:33:45.419
Where's my meal buddy?

00:33:45.962 --> 00:33:48.047
Eat up.

00:33:48.131 --> 00:33:49.715
-Thanks for the food.
-Sure.

00:33:49.799 --> 00:33:51.759
-I'll put this here.
-Okay.

00:33:54.846 --> 00:33:58.599
When Do-ha comes, the menu changes.

00:33:58.724 --> 00:34:01.310
No wonder I feel like having a drink.

00:34:03.354 --> 00:34:05.148
Wait, Director. Stop with the makgeolli.

00:34:06.274 --> 00:34:09.944
I know you'll be doing the concrete work
this afternoon. You're being brazen.

00:34:11.737 --> 00:34:15.575
Then you shouldn't have served
lacquer chicken. You started it.

00:34:15.658 --> 00:34:19.495
Come on, this is to get your strength up,
so you could work.

00:34:19.996 --> 00:34:22.540
If you keep this up,
no more protein for you.

00:34:25.334 --> 00:34:26.377
Fine, man.

00:34:37.513 --> 00:34:40.516
Didn't he have two sons?

00:34:42.018 --> 00:34:44.604
Two, right? That kid and this guy.

00:34:45.354 --> 00:34:47.398
Hasn't Director Baek remarried?

00:34:48.316 --> 00:34:50.902
Don't try to find out.
There's a painful history.

00:34:52.153 --> 00:34:55.573
How hard must it be
for one guy to play two roles?

00:34:57.158 --> 00:34:58.534
He must be exhausted.

00:34:59.577 --> 00:35:02.622
Now explain the dome.
It's the highlight of an observatory.

00:35:03.956 --> 00:35:07.293
Given the school's setup,
maybe make the dome simple,

00:35:09.921 --> 00:35:12.465
I was thinking
we could beam the lights inside.

00:35:12.548 --> 00:35:14.342
We need something fun
even in bad weather.

00:35:16.886 --> 00:35:18.471
Your brother would have smacked you.

00:35:19.096 --> 00:35:22.767
"We couldn't see it today,
but next time, we definitely will."

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:25.102
Isn't that
how people coming to see the stars feel?

00:35:26.938 --> 00:35:28.272
That was pretty deep, Dad.

00:35:29.106 --> 00:35:32.401
You punk. What else? Show me what you got.

00:35:32.485 --> 00:35:33.402
And…

00:35:34.153 --> 00:35:37.865
Are you really leaving?
She bought dried corvina for you.

00:35:37.949 --> 00:35:39.867
Stay over once in a while.

00:35:40.409 --> 00:35:44.664
I can't, I really have a client meeting
early tomorrow morning.

00:35:45.665 --> 00:35:46.666
Don't give me the look.

00:35:47.708 --> 00:35:50.253
No, it's not what you think.
I have two moms, two dads.

00:35:50.336 --> 00:35:52.004
I love the noise. American style.

00:35:54.215 --> 00:35:55.341
I'll stay next time.

00:35:59.679 --> 00:36:00.805
Why?

00:36:02.348 --> 00:36:03.516
Look.

00:36:06.352 --> 00:36:08.396
Thanks to you, the house is a mess.

00:36:08.479 --> 00:36:11.190
Had we sold it on time,
this wouldn't have happened.

00:36:11.274 --> 00:36:13.192
Who do I call about the moldy wallpaper?

00:36:13.276 --> 00:36:15.695
Why's she always bossing you around,
and not me?

00:36:16.279 --> 00:36:17.947
She's really nasty.

00:36:19.031 --> 00:36:22.326
She's unbelievable.
She's always hitting me where it hurts.

00:36:23.244 --> 00:36:25.871
Whenever she wants to stop me,
she brings up Do-young first.

00:36:29.166 --> 00:36:30.084
Do you remember?

00:36:31.544 --> 00:36:35.047
When Mom said she was remarrying,
you disappeared.

00:36:36.007 --> 00:36:38.843
We had a serious crisis meeting.

00:36:40.553 --> 00:36:45.766
To make teenage Baek Do-ha feel better,
we thought of camping trips or gifts.

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:47.852
It was complete chaos.

00:36:49.562 --> 00:36:53.190
Do you know what Ha-gyeong said?

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:55.026
He just…

00:36:56.068 --> 00:36:57.570
wants to come home.

00:37:00.489 --> 00:37:02.825
So don't overreact. Act normal.

00:37:03.492 --> 00:37:06.203
If we make a big deal out of it,
that stubborn dummy

00:37:06.287 --> 00:37:09.582
will force a smile and act mature
to fix the mood.

00:37:13.878 --> 00:37:15.004
She really…

00:37:20.593 --> 00:37:22.511
The peanut house is for Ha-gyeong,

00:37:22.595 --> 00:37:26.057
and Patan High is for Do-young?

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:28.642
And you're not in any of it?

00:37:32.688 --> 00:37:34.273
Yes.

00:37:35.274 --> 00:37:36.942
Oh, my!

00:37:37.526 --> 00:37:38.778
Yes.

00:37:38.861 --> 00:37:41.655
Ha-gyeong, from now on,

00:37:41.739 --> 00:37:45.076
Do-ha will take care of the peanut house,
so you focus on your work.

00:37:48.788 --> 00:37:51.874
The complaints team head's grandmother
suddenly passed away.

00:37:52.625 --> 00:37:54.460
She was on duty today.

00:37:56.462 --> 00:37:57.838
Do I have to fill in again?

00:37:59.256 --> 00:38:02.676
-Want me to take the shift then?
-Today again?

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.512
-Yes.
-You were on duty yesterday too.

00:38:04.595 --> 00:38:05.679
I really don't mind.

00:38:07.556 --> 00:38:09.350
Then I'd feel bad.

00:38:18.401 --> 00:38:20.194
This is funny.

00:38:24.698 --> 00:38:25.574
"Deneb Hall"?

00:38:26.951 --> 00:38:29.620
"Summer Triangle." What's this?

00:38:30.538 --> 00:38:32.039
The headquarters' school project.

00:38:32.123 --> 00:38:35.918
No need to care.
Some artsy, flaky architect is doing it.

00:38:39.672 --> 00:38:41.132
"Summer Triangle."

00:38:43.008 --> 00:38:45.052
Hey, do you think it's only in summer?

00:38:45.678 --> 00:38:48.013
There's a triangle in spring and winter.

00:38:48.764 --> 00:38:51.434
You just mash unrelated things
to make up a name?

00:38:52.268 --> 00:38:53.394
I can't believe it.

00:38:59.608 --> 00:39:01.318
Yes, this is Patan Office.

00:39:01.402 --> 00:39:05.906
I can't sleep with all the noise.
Someone's at Patan High again.

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:08.409
It's almost July. It's that time of year.

00:39:09.326 --> 00:39:12.163
-I see.
-I have to get to work early tomorrow.

00:39:12.246 --> 00:39:14.331
Come fix this right now.

00:39:14.415 --> 00:39:16.333
Yes, understood. I'll go right away.

00:39:22.923 --> 00:39:25.217
-Where are you going?
-Kids are at the school again.

00:39:27.261 --> 00:39:30.639
I'm going straight to the site,

00:39:31.265 --> 00:39:33.267
so if there's another call, call me.

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:35.936
Yes, Officer Pi. Where are you now?

00:39:37.396 --> 00:39:39.440
Looks like
some kids got into Patan High again.

00:39:39.565 --> 00:39:40.691
NO ENTRY

00:39:40.774 --> 00:39:42.985
No, there's no sign of
property damage yet.

00:39:44.612 --> 00:39:46.447
Yes, then I'll wait…

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:51.327
Fireworks are going off inside.

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:53.829
I'm going in. Come as fast as you can.

00:39:59.835 --> 00:40:00.753
Keys.

00:40:34.912 --> 00:40:35.829
Hold my hand.

00:41:02.773 --> 00:41:03.649
Who's there?

00:41:21.125 --> 00:41:22.751
These punks.

00:41:26.505 --> 00:41:27.339
Did he leave?

00:41:29.091 --> 00:41:33.095
Hey, is this okay?
Breaking into school at night to confess?

00:41:33.178 --> 00:41:34.930
Why not? It's nice.

00:41:36.599 --> 00:41:40.060
Don't you have one?
Someone you'd never want to break up with?

00:41:52.323 --> 00:41:54.074
This is all because of Baek Do-young.

00:41:54.158 --> 00:41:56.660
He knows all these crazy superstitions.

00:41:57.828 --> 00:41:59.747
You know
how many demerit points we'd get?

00:42:02.291 --> 00:42:03.417
Hey, you guys were here?

00:42:05.377 --> 00:42:08.005
-Hurry up.
-He's so annoying. Let's go.

00:42:18.432 --> 00:42:19.391
What took you so long?

00:42:19.475 --> 00:42:20.517
Sorry.

00:42:20.601 --> 00:42:21.644
Where's Do-young?

00:42:23.854 --> 00:42:24.730
Here.

00:42:25.939 --> 00:42:27.274
Hey, hurry up.

00:42:38.786 --> 00:42:42.164
On July 7th,
if you confess under the Summer Triangle,

00:42:42.706 --> 00:42:44.708
you'll never break up.

00:42:54.802 --> 00:42:56.804
You're right on time.

00:42:56.887 --> 00:42:58.472
Look, the Summer Triangle.

00:43:03.977 --> 00:43:05.187
You brats!

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:07.606
-Are you on the rooftop?
-Hey, he's coming!

00:43:08.399 --> 00:43:09.983
Hurry!

00:43:12.653 --> 00:43:13.570
Take a good picture.

00:43:15.614 --> 00:43:18.742
Okay, one, two, three.

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:42.933
-It's so beautiful.
-No way.

00:43:43.976 --> 00:43:44.852
Mine's not working.

00:43:46.061 --> 00:43:47.855
-Amazing.
-Mine isn't working.

00:43:50.482 --> 00:43:52.109
Who brought these?

00:43:52.192 --> 00:43:54.027
-What's over there?
-Freeze!

00:43:55.112 --> 00:43:56.697
-Hey, hurry.
-Come out!

00:43:57.573 --> 00:43:59.700
Hey, you brats, come here.

00:43:59.783 --> 00:44:01.577
It's just a warning this time.

00:44:02.911 --> 00:44:04.329
What grade and class are you in?

00:44:05.706 --> 00:44:07.124
Kids are still doing this.

00:44:08.417 --> 00:44:10.252
It happened a few times last year.

00:44:11.295 --> 00:44:13.672
You know July is now the crackdown season?

00:44:14.339 --> 00:44:17.634
We should just put up police tape here
on July 7th.

00:44:50.918 --> 00:44:52.669
Back then, my summer

00:44:54.171 --> 00:44:56.048
was always the season with guests.

00:45:00.802 --> 00:45:02.638
A summer guest named Baek Do-ha.

00:45:07.392 --> 00:45:11.313
When the summer guest came,
our summer began.

00:45:24.201 --> 00:45:28.163
Perfect timing. Let's go see the stars.
There's a meteor shower tonight.

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:33.252
These Baek brothers.

00:45:34.211 --> 00:45:35.212
Let's go.

00:45:39.967 --> 00:45:41.635
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:51.687
At the start of my summers,
there were always those twin brothers.

00:45:52.396 --> 00:45:54.189
Similar, yet completely different.

00:45:54.898 --> 00:45:55.732
Baek Do-young…

00:45:57.192 --> 00:45:58.569
and Baek Do-ha.

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:05.534
Hey, I can't see it.

00:46:07.411 --> 00:46:11.248
Calibrate the telescope
with Vega as your reference.

00:46:11.331 --> 00:46:14.626
Vega makes up the Summer Triangle
with Deneb and Altair.

00:46:15.168 --> 00:46:17.963
So look for the brightest triangle.

00:46:18.338 --> 00:46:20.632
How's she supposed to spot Vega?

00:46:20.716 --> 00:46:23.635
It'd be faster to tell her
to find the Lyra constellation.

00:46:24.469 --> 00:46:26.555
Hey, move. Let me see too.

00:46:26.638 --> 00:46:28.223
Just go look at Altair.

00:46:28.849 --> 00:46:31.810
Why do you go on about Altair
whenever you see me?

00:46:31.893 --> 00:46:32.769
What's that about?

00:46:32.853 --> 00:46:35.272
It's the dimmest of the triangle.

00:46:36.315 --> 00:46:39.526
Plus, in astrology,
Altair is a symbol of bad luck.

00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:40.944
That's so you. Bad luck.

00:46:44.448 --> 00:46:46.825
-Then what are you?
-I'm obviously Vega.

00:46:47.409 --> 00:46:50.537
Vega shines the brightest. Magnitude 0.03.

00:46:51.246 --> 00:46:53.206
Perfect for a straight-A student like me.

00:46:55.334 --> 00:46:56.293
You know what?

00:46:56.835 --> 00:46:59.546
In the East,
Altair is the Cowherd, and Vega…

00:47:00.422 --> 00:47:01.340
is the Weaver Girl.

00:47:02.633 --> 00:47:06.928
Looks like I'll have to be Deneb.
I'm the Magpie Bridge.

00:47:08.805 --> 00:47:09.848
What?

00:47:16.938 --> 00:47:17.981
A meteor shower!

00:47:18.732 --> 00:47:19.566
You're right.

00:47:20.734 --> 00:47:25.072
Back then,
the Summer Triangle referred to us.

00:47:26.365 --> 00:47:29.534
The twins were apart over 300 days a year,

00:47:29.618 --> 00:47:32.496
but they were always together
for stargazing.

00:47:37.334 --> 00:47:40.962
After their parents' divorce,
Do-ha stayed in America with his mom,

00:47:41.505 --> 00:47:43.799
and Do-young came to Korea with his dad.

00:47:44.716 --> 00:47:48.387
That's how Do-young
stayed in the peanut house.

00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:50.263
But during summer,
it was three of us.

00:47:51.306 --> 00:47:54.434
Because Do-ha always came back
in summer.

00:48:01.775 --> 00:48:03.694
-I'll join you!
-What, Ha-gyeong?

00:48:03.777 --> 00:48:07.656
-Hey, Jong-man is waiting for water.
-I want to spray too.

00:48:14.079 --> 00:48:16.164
Yes! I won!

00:48:20.669 --> 00:48:22.629
Hey, one more round. Just once.

00:48:22.713 --> 00:48:25.549
We three were always together
every summer, but…

00:48:25.632 --> 00:48:26.466
-Right.
-Hey!

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:28.927
Even when we were near,
we kept some distance.

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:33.223
Even when apart,
we tried not to drift too far.

00:48:33.932 --> 00:48:38.395
Maintaining that right distance
was the secret to our triangle working.

00:48:39.938 --> 00:48:41.064
But…

00:48:41.148 --> 00:48:44.317
Okay, one, two, three.

00:48:48.071 --> 00:48:49.990
Hey, one more.

00:48:58.165 --> 00:48:59.374
Was it from that moment

00:49:00.751 --> 00:49:03.044
that our triangle began to fall apart?

00:49:09.217 --> 00:49:11.303
You're going to fall.

00:49:11.386 --> 00:49:15.599
Hey. I'm completely sober now. Watch.

00:49:48.048 --> 00:49:53.845
And on that summer night of July 7th,
when the Cowherd and Weaver meet,

00:49:55.013 --> 00:49:59.643
for a brief moment, we became just two.

00:50:07.234 --> 00:50:09.820
And all the points of our triangle…

00:50:11.071 --> 00:50:13.073
ended up falling apart.

00:50:13.156 --> 00:50:14.825
JONG-MAN

00:50:21.665 --> 00:50:22.499
What?

00:50:24.167 --> 00:50:25.293
Do-ha?

00:50:29.798 --> 00:50:30.799
It's you, Do-young.

00:50:36.304 --> 00:50:37.430
Can't sleep?

00:50:38.849 --> 00:50:39.766
Ha-gyeong.

00:50:41.768 --> 00:50:45.522
That place you said you wanted to go,
you want to go now?

00:50:47.023 --> 00:50:48.066
Now?

00:50:49.693 --> 00:50:50.735
Let's go.

00:50:57.784 --> 00:51:00.871
So when are you going to say it?

00:51:10.505 --> 00:51:11.423
I like you.

00:51:11.548 --> 00:51:14.467
In the end,
I couldn't keep the right distance.

00:51:16.094 --> 00:51:19.514
The three of us under the Summer Triangle

00:51:20.265 --> 00:51:21.349
no longer exist.

00:51:22.684 --> 00:51:24.185
We can never go back…

00:51:25.854 --> 00:51:26.771
to that summer.

00:52:02.515 --> 00:52:04.601
-Hello.
-Ms. Song, you're here?

00:52:04.684 --> 00:52:06.227
Ms. Song!

00:52:06.311 --> 00:52:07.896
Hurry, hurry!

00:52:07.979 --> 00:52:09.272
-Come here.
-Why?

00:52:09.397 --> 00:52:10.398
SONG, KIM, TRANSFER

00:52:10.482 --> 00:52:12.484
What? Isn't this weird?

00:52:12.567 --> 00:52:16.196
A random transfer now?
The regular July transfers are coming up.

00:52:17.238 --> 00:52:21.159
Right? It's a one-for-one,
so I'm getting dragged along.

00:52:21.785 --> 00:52:24.955
-You don't want it? Want to trade with me?
-No, it's fine.

00:52:25.789 --> 00:52:27.916
I'll call my mom and be right back.

00:52:28.917 --> 00:52:29.960
She's all smiles.

00:52:31.044 --> 00:52:32.629
Just a moment.

00:52:34.464 --> 00:52:35.548
CHIEF'S OFFICE

00:52:35.632 --> 00:52:37.842
You said you wanted to go to headquarters.

00:52:37.926 --> 00:52:39.594
I just got a call from higher up.

00:52:39.678 --> 00:52:41.471
I never applied to Architecture.

00:52:41.554 --> 00:52:45.350
I really don't know either.
This is sudden for me too.

00:52:45.433 --> 00:52:48.103
How will we handle complaints
without you?

00:52:50.397 --> 00:52:53.650
But isn't this a good thing for you?

00:52:53.775 --> 00:52:54.693
ARCHITECTURE

00:52:54.776 --> 00:52:58.655
-What? I'm the project manager?
-How many times do I have to say it?

00:52:59.698 --> 00:53:02.826
Meet Director Baek from Pluto
and get the contract signed.

00:53:02.909 --> 00:53:05.578
Why am I in charge of
the observatory project?

00:53:06.621 --> 00:53:09.749
Why would they give
such a big project to me?

00:53:10.542 --> 00:53:13.253
Don't you know
you were urgently transferred for this?

00:53:13.878 --> 00:53:19.134
This is your first task as the manager, so
explain it well and have it signed today.

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:21.344
Understood.

00:53:27.225 --> 00:53:28.476
By the way,

00:53:28.977 --> 00:53:31.479
did that jerk Baek Do-ha assign me this?

00:53:33.023 --> 00:53:35.984
-I mean, the director?
-It was the mayor.

00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:39.696
Director Baek said
it had to be Officer Song.

00:53:39.779 --> 00:53:41.322
He even insisted.

00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:44.701
Did you really not hear anything
from Do-ha?

00:53:44.784 --> 00:53:47.078
He hired Su-hyeok for the house.

00:53:47.162 --> 00:53:49.706
He's definitely up to something.

00:53:50.331 --> 00:53:53.752
I haven't heard anything,
and I never asked.

00:53:54.294 --> 00:53:58.298
Last time I went to the peanut house,
it was flooded, the house was a mess.

00:53:58.381 --> 00:54:01.051
All our old boxes were taken out.

00:54:01.134 --> 00:54:04.471
There's still a lot of Do-young's stuff
in there.

00:54:06.139 --> 00:54:07.098
What?

00:54:08.349 --> 00:54:11.144
Where did the ramp go? It's gone?

00:54:11.644 --> 00:54:12.729
They changed it.

00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:17.150
They bragged about ten years
of history. Bullshit.

00:54:17.734 --> 00:54:19.736
How can it change so easily?

00:54:20.361 --> 00:54:21.613
It's your favorite place.

00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:23.740
It's a bummer.

00:54:26.451 --> 00:54:27.994
-Seung-taek.
-Yeah?

00:54:28.078 --> 00:54:31.456
Nothing beats that place, right?

00:54:34.375 --> 00:54:35.543
It's really nice.

00:54:36.086 --> 00:54:39.089
Nothing beats this place. It's great.

00:54:39.631 --> 00:54:41.216
-Should we eat?
-Yeah.

00:54:42.050 --> 00:54:44.761
Looks delicious. Good choice.

00:54:47.305 --> 00:54:50.892
By the way, Seul, has Ha-gyeong
talked to you about her feelings?

00:54:52.685 --> 00:54:54.312
She hasn't talked to you either?

00:54:55.939 --> 00:54:58.608
Song always leaves out
the most important things.

00:54:59.984 --> 00:55:03.488
I can only guess.

00:55:04.697 --> 00:55:06.616
I don't really know.

00:55:06.699 --> 00:55:10.703
What Ha-gyeong feels, what she felt…

00:55:12.122 --> 00:55:13.790
and who she liked.

00:55:36.604 --> 00:55:37.689
Yes, this way.

00:55:39.732 --> 00:55:41.109
Take a look at this.

00:55:41.693 --> 00:55:44.487
Just by looking at the models,
you can tell how stubborn he is.

00:55:45.071 --> 00:55:49.826
Director Baek spent a whole year on this.

00:55:50.118 --> 00:55:52.495
He said he'd only do this project
this summer.

00:55:52.579 --> 00:55:55.165
He worked like crazy.

00:56:11.723 --> 00:56:14.267
So where is he?

00:56:19.439 --> 00:56:21.316
You're finally here, Officer Song.

00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:25.236
That's the contract?

00:56:43.087 --> 00:56:45.089
It's exactly like the work order.

00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:49.093
Director Baek said
it had to be Officer Song.

00:56:49.177 --> 00:56:50.803
He insisted so strongly.

00:56:50.887 --> 00:56:51.721
Baek Do-ha.

00:56:53.473 --> 00:56:54.599
You're not leaving, huh?

00:56:57.936 --> 00:56:58.811
What now?

00:56:59.938 --> 00:57:02.315
You fix the fence,
fix the house, fix the school.

00:57:03.483 --> 00:57:04.567
What's next?

00:57:06.486 --> 00:57:07.570
You.

00:57:08.947 --> 00:57:10.281
And me.

00:57:13.284 --> 00:57:15.453
Everything got messed up
since I listened to you.

00:57:16.329 --> 00:57:17.163
What?

00:57:17.247 --> 00:57:19.707
I thought you'd be happy
if I left like you said.

00:57:21.584 --> 00:57:22.877
But no, you don't look happy.

00:57:24.671 --> 00:57:25.713
Of course…

00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:28.299
neither do I.

00:57:32.053 --> 00:57:35.390
Being apart, nothing's gone right for us.

00:57:37.559 --> 00:57:38.560
So?

00:57:40.353 --> 00:57:42.021
Will I be happy if I'm with you?

00:57:43.439 --> 00:57:44.315
I don't know.

00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:09.966
If I stick around and you keep hating me,

00:58:11.259 --> 00:58:12.802
maybe I'll see your true feelings.

00:58:15.054 --> 00:58:18.099
So you resent me this summer.

00:58:20.685 --> 00:58:22.312
I'll spend this summer…

00:58:23.896 --> 00:58:25.273
liking you.

00:58:36.618 --> 00:58:37.619
I like someone.

00:58:38.411 --> 00:58:41.247
I regret my confession that day.

00:58:49.213 --> 00:58:50.548
You finally said it.

00:58:53.718 --> 00:58:54.719
Do-young.

00:58:56.596 --> 00:58:57.639
Listen…

00:58:59.307 --> 00:59:00.808
I like…

00:59:02.644 --> 00:59:03.686
Do-ha.

00:59:07.815 --> 00:59:09.651
You finally said that too.

00:59:12.236 --> 00:59:13.905
You've always liked Do-ha.

00:59:28.211 --> 00:59:29.379
When are you coming back?

00:59:32.882 --> 00:59:36.052
Next time, the three of us
should go see the stars.

00:59:36.135 --> 00:59:38.680
Until then,
take good care of Do-ha and the house.

00:59:44.977 --> 00:59:46.020
Baek Do-young.

00:59:47.438 --> 00:59:49.148
I promise I'll be back in summer.

00:59:50.316 --> 00:59:52.026
The three of us will reunite then.

00:59:56.698 --> 01:00:00.284
Why can't I forget what I want to forget?

01:00:02.954 --> 01:00:04.247
I'll spend this summer…

01:00:06.082 --> 01:00:07.583
liking you.

01:00:08.751 --> 01:00:11.129
Why do you keep appearing before me…

01:00:11.879 --> 01:00:13.756
when I want to forget you?

01:00:15.591 --> 01:00:16.676
But…

01:00:17.927 --> 01:00:19.762
from the moment you came back…

01:00:21.472 --> 01:00:22.849
I like…

01:00:25.017 --> 01:00:25.935
Do-ha.

01:00:26.018 --> 01:00:27.395
I can't shake off…

01:00:29.188 --> 01:00:30.523
my confession that day.

01:01:15.026 --> 01:01:18.404
Two years of just waiting
and doing nothing is enough.

01:01:19.447 --> 01:01:22.575
What's wrong with you?
What's gotten into you today?

01:01:22.658 --> 01:01:25.453
To deal with Ha-gyeong,
I need to be this prepared.

01:01:25.536 --> 01:01:27.705
Why do you want to stay by my side so bad?

01:01:28.247 --> 01:01:30.082
Why do you want to get away from me?

01:01:30.166 --> 01:01:33.544
We keep driving each other to
make the wrong choices.

01:01:34.587 --> 01:01:35.797
You're dropping the case?

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:38.299
I'll give the house to Baek Do-ha.

01:01:38.382 --> 01:01:40.718
She needs to fight me.

01:01:40.802 --> 01:01:42.428
You asked why I took the case.

01:01:42.970 --> 01:01:44.722
That was Mr. Baek Do-ha's condition.

01:01:44.806 --> 01:01:46.682
I'll do whatever it takes.

01:01:46.766 --> 01:01:50.311
Hey, Baek Do-ha,
you're really annoying.

01:01:51.395 --> 01:01:53.231
Let's never see each other.
