AS YOU STOOD BY

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.458
EP 03
EUN-SU, HUI-SU, AND JIN-PYO

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:30.426
Be ready for me.

00:00:32.053 --> 00:00:33.388
Hit me all you want.

00:00:37.225 --> 00:00:38.685
I'm headed back there now.

00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:17.182
What am I supposed to do now?

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.650
No, Hui-su, you can't! Please, no!

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:34.157
Noh Jin-pyo's the one who should die.
Why should you have to die?

00:01:35.033 --> 00:01:38.369
Because this won't end
unless someone dies.

00:01:40.997 --> 00:01:41.956
Let's kill him.

00:01:44.542 --> 00:01:46.252
We'll kill your husband.

00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:52.467
Eun-su.

00:01:52.967 --> 00:01:54.761
No, Eun-su! Please!

00:02:06.147 --> 00:02:07.565
Damn it.

00:02:38.638 --> 00:02:39.806
Shit.

00:02:43.142 --> 00:02:44.227
This damn rain!

00:02:58.783 --> 00:03:01.619
-I made a mistake.
-And mistakes have consequences.

00:03:02.203 --> 00:03:03.204
Honey.

00:03:07.625 --> 00:03:09.043
What are you doing?

00:03:09.627 --> 00:03:11.212
It won't happen again.

00:03:25.768 --> 00:03:26.602
Honey.

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:29.063
Honey.

00:03:33.568 --> 00:03:36.112
Tomorrow, I'll go to her
and beg for forgiveness.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.036
Not a single person there
will have noticed that you beat me.

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.953
Don't worry.

00:03:46.247 --> 00:03:48.041
You really think I'd worry about that?

00:03:49.208 --> 00:03:50.209
Don't!

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.170
Please, just don't!

00:04:06.476 --> 00:04:07.477
One moment.

00:04:11.606 --> 00:04:13.107
Don't come out, no matter what.

00:04:13.191 --> 00:04:14.734
I need to have a word with him.

00:04:19.697 --> 00:04:20.948
You asked for it.

00:04:21.783 --> 00:04:23.618
You can't change your mind now.

00:04:25.036 --> 00:04:27.663
You screwed up a major deal,
so the least you can do

00:04:28.247 --> 00:04:29.957
is make the US stocks soar tonight.

00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:31.876
The day after I give you a whupping,

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:35.088
the US stock market
never fails to skyrocket.

00:04:48.893 --> 00:04:49.936
Hush.

00:04:50.019 --> 00:04:50.853
Hello.

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.439
No, I haven't been able to reach her yet.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.400
Her phone's off.

00:04:56.818 --> 00:04:57.819
Right.

00:04:58.736 --> 00:05:00.113
Her phone is off,

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.989
and it's rather late.

00:05:03.616 --> 00:05:04.617
Understood.

00:05:06.661 --> 00:05:08.162
Keep quiet, damn it.

00:05:08.246 --> 00:05:11.416
Did you see me get summoned
by that brainless idiot at this hour?

00:05:11.916 --> 00:05:13.584
If this deal falls through,

00:05:15.586 --> 00:05:16.421
what's coming

00:05:17.588 --> 00:05:18.714
will be far worse

00:05:20.508 --> 00:05:22.009
than what you're used to.

00:05:43.156 --> 00:05:44.157
Hui-su.

00:05:47.493 --> 00:05:48.494
I can't.

00:06:07.597 --> 00:06:13.978
DEARLY DEPARTED
KANG HUI-YEON

00:06:35.166 --> 00:06:36.667
I'm sorry, Mrs. Kang.

00:06:38.753 --> 00:06:40.129
Please help us.

00:07:55.871 --> 00:07:56.706
Hui-su!

00:08:13.347 --> 00:08:14.432
Hui-su.

00:08:15.016 --> 00:08:16.809
Wake up, Hui-su.

00:08:17.435 --> 00:08:18.436
Hui-su!

00:08:20.062 --> 00:08:21.063
The phone!

00:08:33.326 --> 00:08:35.703
AMBULANCE

00:09:04.774 --> 00:09:05.775
Hey, wake up.

00:09:07.276 --> 00:09:08.110
Wake up.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:11.155
Jo Hui-su, wake up. Jo Hui-su?

00:09:27.922 --> 00:09:30.800
Are you trying to ruin my life?

00:09:30.883 --> 00:09:32.259
You don't get to decide to die!

00:09:32.343 --> 00:09:33.886
If you don't want me to die…

00:09:35.888 --> 00:09:37.682
then please take that thing down.

00:09:40.768 --> 00:09:43.521
I can put up with you beating me,

00:09:45.022 --> 00:09:49.193
but I can't stand
living like some monkey in a zoo, so…

00:09:50.277 --> 00:09:52.196
That thing. Please take it down.

00:09:56.867 --> 00:09:58.494
That's never happening.

00:10:05.418 --> 00:10:06.252
Hey.

00:10:08.254 --> 00:10:09.547
Why, you!

00:10:10.214 --> 00:10:11.132
You're not dying!

00:11:20.493 --> 00:11:21.535
I can do it.

00:11:23.245 --> 00:11:24.079
I'll do it.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.554
It won't be easy.

00:11:42.473 --> 00:11:43.849
And once the deed is done,

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.852
we'll be faced
with even tougher obstacles.

00:11:47.937 --> 00:11:49.188
But if we just…

00:11:56.028 --> 00:12:01.408
EUN-SU

00:12:32.106 --> 00:12:32.940
Let's do it.

00:12:33.774 --> 00:12:34.775
We can do this.

00:13:21.447 --> 00:13:25.784
This is an announcement
from the management office.

00:13:26.368 --> 00:13:31.206
We've recently received several complaints
about indoor smoking.

00:13:31.832 --> 00:13:36.253
Smoke is drifting into other units
through balconies and bathroom vents.

00:13:37.129 --> 00:13:40.758
Residents on higher floors have been
experiencing particular discomfort,

00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:43.761
so we kindly ask all residents
to refrain from smoking indoors.

00:13:43.844 --> 00:13:45.846
Allow me to repeat.

00:13:46.347 --> 00:13:50.726
We've recently received several complaints
about indoor smoking.

00:14:30.849 --> 00:14:33.852
We've recently received
several complaints…

00:14:33.936 --> 00:14:35.020
I'm off to work.

00:14:35.104 --> 00:14:38.774
Residents on higher floors have been
experiencing particular discomfort,

00:14:38.857 --> 00:14:41.610
so we kindly ask everyone
to refrain from smoking indoors.

00:15:14.351 --> 00:15:15.352
A screwdriver?

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.190
Yes, it's about this small.

00:15:20.691 --> 00:15:23.318
I think I dropped it here
while changing your watch strap.

00:15:53.807 --> 00:15:55.684
Well, it doesn't seem to be here.

00:15:55.768 --> 00:15:59.396
Right, I guess I must have dropped it
somewhere else and got confused.

00:16:15.204 --> 00:16:17.414
I trust there are no issues
with your watch?

00:16:19.625 --> 00:16:20.709
There shouldn't be.

00:16:23.087 --> 00:16:23.962
Of course.

00:16:28.175 --> 00:16:30.010
About what you said last time,

00:16:30.969 --> 00:16:32.679
I don't think it makes sense.

00:16:33.555 --> 00:16:34.389
What did I say?

00:16:35.265 --> 00:16:38.727
"She should have killed her damn husband.
Why throw away your life?"

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:44.024
What about it?

00:16:46.568 --> 00:16:49.113
If the police catch you,
it'll all be for nothing.

00:16:57.121 --> 00:16:58.956
You shouldn't get caught, then.

00:17:02.751 --> 00:17:04.670
That's impossible in this day and age.

00:17:04.753 --> 00:17:07.047
Either keep them
from knowing you killed him

00:17:07.548 --> 00:17:09.675
or keep them from knowing he's dead.

00:17:11.426 --> 00:17:12.678
You've seen too many movies.

00:17:12.761 --> 00:17:15.472
What could they do
if there's no body to find?

00:17:27.943 --> 00:17:29.111
Anyway, why do you ask?

00:17:34.825 --> 00:17:38.453
You were at the funeral of that woman
from the news and saw her husband, right?

00:17:38.537 --> 00:17:39.663
Don't!

00:17:42.541 --> 00:17:43.375
Yes.

00:17:46.628 --> 00:17:49.506
Goddamn it.
I've suddenly lost my appetite.

00:17:53.385 --> 00:17:54.386
Let's go eat

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.848
that hangover soup we skipped last time.

00:17:57.931 --> 00:18:00.851
I have to go. Please excuse me.

00:18:11.528 --> 00:18:12.738
Hello.

00:18:17.576 --> 00:18:20.621
JINGANG CHINESE MARKET

00:18:35.469 --> 00:18:37.137
-Mr. Jin, is there--
-One second.

00:18:39.848 --> 00:18:40.849
Hey, Jang Kang.

00:18:42.851 --> 00:18:44.186
Take that out first,

00:18:46.021 --> 00:18:48.148
then you'll need to make
two trips for these.

00:18:52.027 --> 00:18:53.695
I can carry these over in one.

00:18:54.655 --> 00:18:55.781
Do it in two trips.

00:18:55.864 --> 00:18:59.326
Otherwise, you'll hurt yourself
and end up with a huge medical bill.

00:19:02.579 --> 00:19:04.373
Thank you, boss.

00:19:11.004 --> 00:19:12.256
You were saying?

00:19:13.465 --> 00:19:15.968
I think I'll stay
for some hangover soup after all.

00:19:38.699 --> 00:19:41.034
Who knows what I might pull out next?

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:56.425
Sorry.

00:19:59.094 --> 00:20:01.346
Is that man undocumented?

00:20:04.391 --> 00:20:05.225
Pretty much.

00:20:07.144 --> 00:20:08.645
What do you mean by that?

00:20:09.604 --> 00:20:10.564
He's a stowaway.

00:20:13.275 --> 00:20:14.401
So he's got no passport?

00:20:15.068 --> 00:20:17.821
He either couldn't afford one
or fled here to avoid trouble.

00:20:17.904 --> 00:20:19.781
Knowing Jang Kang, it must be the former.

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.249
What could they do
if there's no body to find?

00:20:58.695 --> 00:21:02.074
Are you sure Jin-pyo doesn't have
any cousins or relatives in China?

00:21:03.367 --> 00:21:04.409
Yes.

00:21:11.208 --> 00:21:12.542
Let's give it a try.

00:21:19.257 --> 00:21:20.092
Okay.

00:21:36.066 --> 00:21:37.067
Hello.

00:21:42.739 --> 00:21:44.616
May I have a minute of your time?

00:21:48.453 --> 00:21:49.287
How come…

00:21:51.415 --> 00:21:52.499
you're offering me

00:21:53.834 --> 00:21:58.213
such a large sum
just to go to China with a passport?

00:22:00.632 --> 00:22:04.678
It comes with the condition
that you don't ask any questions.

00:22:08.974 --> 00:22:12.477
If you do exactly as I ask,
you won't be in any danger, Mr. Jang.

00:22:14.187 --> 00:22:17.649
Though I guess there's no greater danger
than being an undocumented stowaway.

00:22:23.738 --> 00:22:27.200
You can either stay here,
living in fear, hiding, and scraping by,

00:22:27.701 --> 00:22:31.329
or make a big lump sum and go back home
to live happily with your family.

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:33.039
The choice is yours.

00:22:35.125 --> 00:22:37.878
This time, you'd be flying,
not hidden in a ship's hold.

00:22:43.758 --> 00:22:45.594
I need an answer within three days.

00:22:48.221 --> 00:22:49.347
That quickly?

00:22:50.849 --> 00:22:51.683
Yes.

00:23:00.859 --> 00:23:02.152
If I may,

00:23:03.737 --> 00:23:05.864
could I ask you just one more thing?

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.958
Is the passport's owner…

00:23:20.587 --> 00:23:21.796
still alive?

00:23:34.184 --> 00:23:35.810
Of course he's still alive.

00:23:41.608 --> 00:23:43.276
It's okay. He didn't notice.

00:23:47.989 --> 00:23:52.494
I was shocked the moment he walked
into the café. The resemblance is uncanny.

00:23:52.577 --> 00:23:54.955
Fortunately, he's very easy to read.

00:23:55.747 --> 00:23:58.583
Judging by his expression,
he may make up his mind soon.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.753
He didn't seem like a bad guy.

00:24:04.256 --> 00:24:07.801
If he does his part,
Noh Jin-pyo would be considered missing.

00:24:08.802 --> 00:24:11.972
All we need is a solid reason
for Jin-pyo to fly himself out to China.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:33.994
The person you are calling is unavailable.
Please leave a message.

00:24:36.955 --> 00:24:38.290
MS. KIM MI-GYEONG

00:24:44.713 --> 00:24:45.547
Hey.

00:24:46.798 --> 00:24:47.799
How did it go?

00:24:49.718 --> 00:24:51.177
Things will blow over soon.

00:24:52.137 --> 00:24:53.680
We'll get her to stop by soon.

00:24:56.141 --> 00:24:57.142
Great.

00:25:03.982 --> 00:25:06.401
I wholeheartedly agree with you, Ms. Kim.

00:25:07.277 --> 00:25:09.863
He's a hardworking guy,
and I want to have his back…

00:25:09.946 --> 00:25:10.947
BRANCH MANAGER'S ROOM

00:25:11.531 --> 00:25:13.658
…but the way he showed you

00:25:13.742 --> 00:25:16.536
such blatant disrespect on your big day…

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:18.913
Goodness, that behavior of his

00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:21.166
is simply unforgivable.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.919
I was thinking, Ms. Kim.
Why don't you let me take care of it?

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:29.132
I'll take Mr. Noh out of the picture
and find you the best and brightest.

00:25:29.215 --> 00:25:32.677
Of course, I'll pick out some guys
with the best attitude.

00:25:32.761 --> 00:25:34.721
How about I build you a new team?

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:37.766
Thank you for trusting me with this.

00:25:38.266 --> 00:25:39.601
Yes, goodbye.

00:25:40.101 --> 00:25:41.728
Yes, of course. "Attitude!"

00:25:45.982 --> 00:25:48.109
CLIENT PROFILE
KIM MI-GYEONG

00:26:06.044 --> 00:26:07.545
"Lavie Department Store"?

00:26:35.073 --> 00:26:37.325
DOWNLOAD COMPLETE

00:27:24.164 --> 00:27:26.249
I thought we'd dine out for a change.

00:27:28.126 --> 00:27:29.836
Wear whatever you want today.

00:27:31.796 --> 00:27:33.006
Come out when you're done.

00:27:33.631 --> 00:27:34.466
Okay.

00:27:57.489 --> 00:27:58.990
I told you to dress comfortably.

00:28:00.408 --> 00:28:02.702
I've always admired your sensibility.

00:28:16.049 --> 00:28:16.883
Hello, Eun-su.

00:28:18.134 --> 00:28:19.135
Hello.

00:28:19.219 --> 00:28:20.345
I'm good, thanks.

00:28:22.889 --> 00:28:23.932
Hey, Hui-su.

00:28:24.557 --> 00:28:25.391
Hey.

00:28:27.143 --> 00:28:30.271
Hui-su said she hasn't seen you
in a while. I wanted to surprise her.

00:28:30.772 --> 00:28:32.106
I hope that's okay with you.

00:28:32.941 --> 00:28:33.775
Yes, sure.

00:28:34.526 --> 00:28:35.693
And you, honey?

00:28:36.194 --> 00:28:37.153
Yes, of course.

00:28:39.572 --> 00:28:40.573
Excuse me.

00:28:54.212 --> 00:28:55.922
Glad to see you again, Eun-su.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:58.424
You too.

00:29:01.094 --> 00:29:02.428
Thank you as always, honey.

00:29:02.512 --> 00:29:03.847
Goodness me.

00:29:04.973 --> 00:29:06.641
Oh dear.

00:29:07.267 --> 00:29:08.268
Are you okay?

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:09.936
I'm sorry, honey.

00:29:11.062 --> 00:29:11.896
Excuse me.

00:29:15.233 --> 00:29:16.985
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

00:29:17.694 --> 00:29:19.571
-How may I help, sir?
-I spilled my drink.

00:29:20.154 --> 00:29:21.406
Let me assist you, ma'am.

00:29:22.365 --> 00:29:24.409
Go on, honey.
Eun-su and I will start without you.

00:29:26.703 --> 00:29:28.204
I'll make it quick, then.

00:29:39.173 --> 00:29:40.008
Shall we?

00:29:41.634 --> 00:29:43.386
Excuse me. I need to use the restroom.

00:29:43.469 --> 00:29:44.512
The built-in closet.

00:29:47.891 --> 00:29:49.309
You were in there, weren't you?

00:29:57.525 --> 00:30:00.278
I hope you don't think
what you saw is the entire story.

00:30:01.779 --> 00:30:02.614
Hui-su

00:30:04.365 --> 00:30:05.366
is unwell.

00:30:20.757 --> 00:30:21.591
Hui-su…

00:30:23.593 --> 00:30:25.803
has been struggling because of her mother.

00:30:28.473 --> 00:30:32.018
After her miscarriage
and giving up writing children's books,

00:30:32.602 --> 00:30:34.854
she started having
some very dark thoughts.

00:30:36.147 --> 00:30:39.484
I installed a camera at home
out of concern, but, unfortunately,

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.654
made you see her at her worst.

00:30:47.367 --> 00:30:48.368
Eun-su.

00:30:51.412 --> 00:30:52.956
Hui-su is very unwell.

00:30:54.999 --> 00:30:56.918
And yet you beat her to a pulp?

00:31:08.179 --> 00:31:10.139
Some things
only married couples know about.

00:31:11.057 --> 00:31:12.517
And violence is one of them?

00:31:24.696 --> 00:31:27.115
It's best not to meddle
in others' marriages.

00:31:28.533 --> 00:31:30.660
My Hui-su would die without me.

00:31:32.161 --> 00:31:33.413
The same goes for me.

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:36.624
That's marriage.

00:31:36.708 --> 00:31:39.585
You mean it's a bond
that only death can put an end to?

00:31:43.047 --> 00:31:44.757
Stay in your lane, lady.

00:31:50.096 --> 00:31:52.473
The more you push,
the worse it gets for Hui-su.

00:31:58.479 --> 00:32:00.815
Meaning you'll beat her again tonight?

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:16.330
Honey, looks like you won't have to beg
Ms. Kim for forgiveness after all.

00:32:17.415 --> 00:32:18.708
Is it all sorted out?

00:32:20.585 --> 00:32:22.754
It seems Eun-su will be helping us out.

00:32:39.645 --> 00:32:43.066
Isn't it amusing how things work out?

00:32:43.691 --> 00:32:48.196
Hui-su has been quite troubled by this,
so I take it you will step in, right?

00:32:56.454 --> 00:32:58.331
MS. KIM MI-GYEONG
CHEONGDAM-DONG

00:32:58.414 --> 00:33:02.794
HOPES TO HOLD SOLO EXHIBITION
BEFORE TURNING 60

00:33:02.877 --> 00:33:05.463
I've always wanted to see
your first piece.

00:33:05.546 --> 00:33:07.757
Thank you for graciously inviting me
to your studio.

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.719
Compared to what you did for me
back then, this is nothing.

00:33:11.803 --> 00:33:13.513
I didn't do anything back then.

00:33:13.596 --> 00:33:16.682
I was still new, so all I could do
was run to you as fast as I could.

00:33:16.766 --> 00:33:19.894
You arrived even before the police
and the tow truck.

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:23.898
That day, I was miserably betrayed
by my mother-in-law.

00:33:23.981 --> 00:33:27.485
If not for you, I'd have frozen out there
alone on Yeongdong-daero,

00:33:27.985 --> 00:33:29.570
feeling utterly crushed.

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:32.532
What kind of tea would you like?

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.118
Ms. Kim.

00:33:36.577 --> 00:33:39.789
Do you remember
what you said to me back then?

00:33:51.717 --> 00:33:53.427
Could you tell me what's on the menu?

00:33:57.223 --> 00:33:58.224
Thank you

00:33:59.392 --> 00:34:00.685
for agreeing to meet me.

00:34:00.768 --> 00:34:02.854
Ms. Jo is the one you should be thanking.

00:34:04.188 --> 00:34:08.109
I've accepted your apology
and forgiven you, so stop calling me.

00:34:08.943 --> 00:34:10.027
You may leave now.

00:34:15.616 --> 00:34:19.120
So this is
how you've chosen to use my offer

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:20.997
to grant you any favor?

00:34:25.751 --> 00:34:27.879
Your lifelong dream is to hold

00:34:27.962 --> 00:34:30.840
a great solo exhibition
before turning 60, isn't it?

00:34:30.923 --> 00:34:32.008
You remembered that?

00:34:32.508 --> 00:34:36.470
I had always wished for my mom
to live with her own dream,

00:34:36.971 --> 00:34:37.930
just like you.

00:34:41.392 --> 00:34:45.479
I thought you'd be happier if you could
dedicate yourself solely to painting.

00:35:15.468 --> 00:35:16.802
I've got this. You can go.

00:35:16.886 --> 00:35:19.305
Goodness, Ms. Kim.
Why didn't you call before coming?

00:35:27.355 --> 00:35:28.189
Wait, what?

00:35:30.107 --> 00:35:33.069
I'd prefer not to be involved
in any particular way.

00:35:33.569 --> 00:35:36.489
And make sure my husband doesn't find out.

00:35:37.698 --> 00:35:38.532
Yes, ma'am.

00:35:39.033 --> 00:35:42.662
Many of my clients prefer
a more hands-off approach like you.

00:35:42.745 --> 00:35:45.665
In that regard, you can rest assured.

00:35:57.593 --> 00:36:00.972
If you just stay in your lane,
Hui-su won't get hurt.

00:36:02.056 --> 00:36:04.433
Leave the marital affairs
to the married couple.

00:36:18.114 --> 00:36:20.032
I thought I banned you for a month.

00:36:21.158 --> 00:36:23.786
The gym is closed today,
so it doesn't count.

00:36:28.791 --> 00:36:30.293
Go. Come back in a month.

00:36:30.793 --> 00:36:31.794
Or don't.

00:36:32.837 --> 00:36:33.838
Sir.

00:36:36.757 --> 00:36:39.135
Let me just stay for a while.

00:37:46.077 --> 00:37:50.790
SOGANG UNIVERSITY, ECHO, JO EUN-SU

00:38:10.476 --> 00:38:12.353
MR. JANG KANG

00:38:14.063 --> 00:38:14.897
Hello?

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:16.774
Hello.

00:38:19.068 --> 00:38:19.902
That job.

00:38:20.903 --> 00:38:21.821
I'll do it.

00:38:25.866 --> 00:38:27.910
Are you sure you're set on doing this?

00:38:28.828 --> 00:38:29.829
Yes.

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:33.124
I miss my son.

00:38:58.899 --> 00:38:59.942
Thank you.

00:39:21.755 --> 00:39:22.673
I'm back, sir.

00:39:22.756 --> 00:39:24.592
Did I see you get out of a car just now?

00:39:28.012 --> 00:39:28.846
Yes.

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.474
I ran into a friend from back home.

00:39:33.434 --> 00:39:34.435
Come on.

00:39:35.436 --> 00:39:37.354
A friend from back home? Really?

00:39:40.024 --> 00:39:41.317
What a nice surprise.

00:39:42.067 --> 00:39:42.902
Yes.

00:39:44.653 --> 00:39:46.530
-Let's call it a day.
-Yes, sir.

00:40:12.681 --> 00:40:14.141
From Ms. Kim's account?

00:40:14.642 --> 00:40:18.270
Jin-pyo asked me to set up a meeting
with her, so it would seem most natural.

00:40:20.814 --> 00:40:23.234
I feel awful
that she'll be affected by this.

00:40:24.652 --> 00:40:26.070
I feel bad about it, too,

00:40:26.695 --> 00:40:27.988
but for a loss of that size,

00:40:28.072 --> 00:40:31.575
Jin-pyo's company should be able to
compensate her without word getting out.

00:40:32.243 --> 00:40:33.452
As for her feelings,

00:40:34.328 --> 00:40:35.829
I'll do my best to comfort her.

00:40:38.666 --> 00:40:40.084
Mr. Jang's coming. Talk later.

00:40:41.168 --> 00:40:42.002
Okay.

00:40:58.978 --> 00:41:01.772
I barely recognized myself
in the bathroom mirror.

00:41:02.565 --> 00:41:03.399
But

00:41:04.608 --> 00:41:05.859
I liked what I saw.

00:41:06.569 --> 00:41:07.820
Yes, it suits you.

00:41:08.654 --> 00:41:09.738
Please, let me.

00:41:11.949 --> 00:41:12.950
Gosh, all these…

00:41:15.286 --> 00:41:17.580
One second. Something's in your hair.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.085
They put a lot of stuff in my hair.

00:41:32.303 --> 00:41:33.137
Hey, stop the car.

00:41:45.149 --> 00:41:47.443
Ma'am, we have to go.

00:41:52.573 --> 00:41:53.949
Sirens on when responding.

00:41:54.033 --> 00:41:54.867
Right.

00:42:02.541 --> 00:42:04.084
Is something wrong, ma'am?

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:06.045
It's nothing.

00:42:09.131 --> 00:42:12.468
Jin-pyo, I'm on track to be reviewed
for dispatch to the presidential office…

00:42:12.551 --> 00:42:14.136
CHOI WON-HO

00:42:21.769 --> 00:42:25.773
Yes, we are currently en route.
I'll report back as soon as we arrive.

00:42:41.413 --> 00:42:42.456
MINE

00:42:42.539 --> 00:42:44.917
BREEZEHILL, 42-78
APGUJEONG-RO, GANGNAM, SEOUL

00:42:53.717 --> 00:42:55.260
Watch me bag a promotion

00:42:55.344 --> 00:42:58.138
before Jin-young ends up
at the presidential office.

00:42:59.723 --> 00:43:02.976
I must say, you're glowing these days.

00:43:05.896 --> 00:43:08.107
You're not sitting on good news, are you?

00:43:10.526 --> 00:43:12.069
No, there's no such thing.

00:43:12.778 --> 00:43:14.363
I'd be very upset if there was.

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:18.701
Hold on.

00:43:21.412 --> 00:43:22.246
One second.

00:43:35.509 --> 00:43:37.928
Which one will you wear
for your Thursday work dinner?

00:43:38.429 --> 00:43:40.973
-At his monthly branch dinners…
-This one.

00:43:41.056 --> 00:43:42.558
…he drinks more than usual.

00:43:43.934 --> 00:43:45.853
He drinks even more once he gets home,

00:43:47.646 --> 00:43:49.106
then passes out and sleeps.

00:43:49.606 --> 00:43:52.651
You'll be flying out this Friday.

00:43:56.113 --> 00:43:57.406
That soon?

00:43:58.198 --> 00:44:01.326
Isn't three days enough?
Do you have a lot to take care of?

00:44:04.747 --> 00:44:06.123
Well, not exactly.

00:44:08.125 --> 00:44:09.168
Noted, ma'am.

00:44:09.251 --> 00:44:11.920
We'll let you know the flight time
once it's confirmed.

00:44:12.004 --> 00:44:13.130
"We"?

00:44:15.257 --> 00:44:17.509
Me and the passport owner.

00:44:20.387 --> 00:44:21.221
I see.

00:44:26.477 --> 00:44:28.187
Here's the deposit we agreed on.

00:44:32.399 --> 00:44:34.485
Your son must have really missed his dad.

00:44:34.568 --> 00:44:37.321
Tell your wife and son
to come pick you up at the airport.

00:44:37.404 --> 00:44:38.989
I included their travel expenses.

00:45:06.975 --> 00:45:08.227
-Here.
-Great, thanks.

00:45:10.604 --> 00:45:11.688
MS. JO EUN-SU

00:45:20.614 --> 00:45:24.243
Isn't Mr. Jang looking quite stylish?
Maybe he has a new girlfriend.

00:45:24.326 --> 00:45:26.411
He says he's going back home.

00:45:29.164 --> 00:45:29.998
Who did?

00:45:30.499 --> 00:45:31.416
Jang Kang, sir.

00:45:32.417 --> 00:45:34.253
I doubt he managed to save much though.

00:45:39.675 --> 00:45:42.135
Please handle your affairs
as quietly as possible.

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:44.805
Watch out for Mr. Jin in particular.

00:45:44.888 --> 00:45:46.598
He seems like the perceptive type.

00:45:48.976 --> 00:45:49.810
All right.

00:46:30.517 --> 00:46:32.227
You're done with classes for the day,

00:46:32.311 --> 00:46:35.564
so the sparring and attendance ban
don't apply now, sir.

00:46:51.413 --> 00:46:55.334
Ever wonder why, after all these years,
you're the only one still a white belt?

00:46:57.961 --> 00:46:59.922
Since the moment you walked in,

00:47:00.005 --> 00:47:02.716
it was clear that you wanted
to learn martial arts out of…

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:06.094
sheer desperation.

00:47:09.264 --> 00:47:12.309
I denied your belt promotion
and gave you the sweatiest opponents,

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:15.354
and yet you stuck around,
refusing to walk away.

00:47:15.437 --> 00:47:17.940
I'd like a proper chance
to test my skills.

00:48:08.699 --> 00:48:10.367
JO EUN-SU

00:49:35.202 --> 00:49:36.286
Sir.

00:50:02.354 --> 00:50:03.355
Jo Eun-su.

00:50:06.191 --> 00:50:07.734
Today's your last day at this gym.

00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:15.283
Don't hurt yourself.

00:51:06.334 --> 00:51:09.254
Is it okay if I go visit Mom
with Eun-su today?

00:51:10.005 --> 00:51:10.964
With Eun-su?

00:51:11.464 --> 00:51:13.383
She says she misses my mom.

00:51:16.136 --> 00:51:16.970
Go along, then.

00:51:19.472 --> 00:51:20.599
I won't be too late.

00:51:21.099 --> 00:51:22.267
All right.

00:51:41.912 --> 00:51:45.040
We won't be using the GPS tomorrow.

00:51:47.417 --> 00:51:48.251
Okay.

00:52:17.864 --> 00:52:19.241
MINE

00:52:29.417 --> 00:52:30.961
Hello, Mr. Noh.

00:52:31.044 --> 00:52:32.921
Goodness, ma'am. Why, hello.

00:52:33.004 --> 00:52:34.172
Have you been well?

00:52:34.256 --> 00:52:35.382
Yes.

00:52:35.465 --> 00:52:38.260
-Did we perhaps meet last time?
-Yes, you're right.

00:52:38.343 --> 00:52:40.553
I've heard only great things, ma'am.

00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:11.459
We're almost there.

00:53:14.087 --> 00:53:15.380
Yes, we are.

00:53:16.923 --> 00:53:20.593
Don't you think Deputy Branch Manager
Noh Jin-pyo owes us a few words?

00:53:20.677 --> 00:53:22.012
There's no need for that.

00:53:22.095 --> 00:53:24.723
-Noh Jin-pyo!
-Noh Jin-pyo!

00:53:24.806 --> 00:53:26.808
-Hey, that's enough.
-Noh Jin-pyo!

00:53:26.891 --> 00:53:29.602
-Come on, everyone.
-Noh Jin-pyo!

00:53:29.686 --> 00:53:34.399
-Noh Jin-pyo!
-Noh Jin-pyo!

00:53:39.529 --> 00:53:40.363
Looking great!

00:53:40.447 --> 00:53:41.531
I'm sure some of you

00:53:43.116 --> 00:53:47.329
were secretly hoping
I'd crash and burn this time,

00:53:48.705 --> 00:53:52.625
but how could I let that happen
when our branch's success depends on me?

00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:54.794
I, Noh Jin-pyo,

00:53:56.171 --> 00:53:58.506
won't go down in flames.
Not now, not ever.

00:53:59.632 --> 00:54:01.051
So trust me,

00:54:02.385 --> 00:54:03.887
and let's move forward as one.

00:54:04.471 --> 00:54:05.930
-For Golden One!
-For Golden One!

00:54:19.778 --> 00:54:24.741
MOUNTAIN 1, DAECHI-RI, HYEONBUK-MYEON,
YANGYANG-GUN, GANGWON-DO

00:54:31.915 --> 00:54:33.458
She didn't go to the nursing home.

00:54:36.294 --> 00:54:38.004
What was she up to in the mountains?

00:54:46.304 --> 00:54:51.017
MR. NOH JIN-PYO,
YOU HAVEN'T BOOKED ACCOMMODATION

00:54:57.607 --> 00:54:59.818
YOUR TRIP IS COMING UP, MR. NOH JIN-PYO!

00:54:59.901 --> 00:55:02.946
HURRY BEFORE YOUR SHANGHAI HOTEL
DISCOUNT EXPIRES!

00:59:40.264 --> 00:59:45.269
