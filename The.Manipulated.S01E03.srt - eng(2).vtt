The Manipulated

00:00:41.146 --> 00:00:45.859
Now we have in an Arleli piece
with the starting bid at 2.3 billion won.

00:00:45.942 --> 00:00:47.194
Do I hear 2.4?

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:48.904
We have 2.4 billion.

00:00:48.987 --> 00:00:50.489
2.5?

00:00:50.572 --> 00:00:53.075
2.5 has been phoned in. Now, 2.6?

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.329
From the floor, 2.6, by bidder number 40.

00:00:57.412 --> 00:00:59.664
Now do I hear 2.7 billion won?

00:00:59.748 --> 00:01:00.874
[crunches]

00:01:00.957 --> 00:01:02.751
[beeping, whirring]

00:01:02.834 --> 00:01:06.421
Yes, we have an online bid
coming in at 2.7 billion won

00:01:06.505 --> 00:01:08.048
by bidder number 56.

00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:09.758
Now, do we have 2.8?

00:01:10.592 --> 00:01:12.928
Yes. Thank you, bidder number 39.

00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:15.972
Now, Arleli pieces
always fetch high prices

00:01:16.056 --> 00:01:17.557
as they're highly sought after.

00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:19.893
With every auction,
their genius as a sculptor

00:01:19.976 --> 00:01:21.645
is reflected by these record prices.

00:01:22.437 --> 00:01:25.732
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity
to own a part of history

00:01:25.816 --> 00:01:28.443
with this piece
from Arleli's "Wailing" series.

00:01:28.527 --> 00:01:31.613
With that in mind,
do I hear 2.9 billion won?

00:01:34.324 --> 00:01:35.367
[crunching]

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.495
We've received 2.9 from online.

00:01:38.578 --> 00:01:42.082
That bidder now holds
the highest bid at 2.9 billion won.

00:01:42.165 --> 00:01:44.543
Now, can we ask for three billion? Anyone?

00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:49.840
We have three billion won
from bidder number 39 on the floor.

00:01:49.923 --> 00:01:51.341
Since things are heating up,

00:01:51.425 --> 00:01:53.552
I think it's time
to raise the bid increment

00:01:53.635 --> 00:01:55.637
up to 500 million won.

00:01:56.388 --> 00:01:58.014
3.5 billion.

00:01:58.098 --> 00:02:00.350
Do I hear 3.5?

00:02:00.434 --> 00:02:02.561
3.5 billion won.

00:02:02.644 --> 00:02:03.979
[beeping, whirring]

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.149
Yes, from the online bidder.

00:02:07.232 --> 00:02:09.901
The online bid stands
at the highest at 3.5 billion.

00:02:09.985 --> 00:02:11.194
Do I have four?

00:02:12.654 --> 00:02:13.905
[sighs]

00:02:16.074 --> 00:02:17.659
Although it's a little unorthodox,

00:02:17.743 --> 00:02:20.495
considering the high value
of a sculpture like this,

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.998
our bidders might need
extra time to decide.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.501
So we'll take a five-minute break
and be back momentarily.

00:02:29.713 --> 00:02:32.007

CHAIRMAN SHIN MYUNGHO

00:02:39.514 --> 00:02:43.143
Is there anything else I can get you
instead of the art sculpture?

00:02:43.727 --> 00:02:46.563
Something that has a set price
so I don't have to bid for it?

00:02:46.646 --> 00:02:48.857
[Yohan] Let me ask you this, Mr. Chairman.

00:02:49.858 --> 00:02:52.819
How much are you willing to pay
for your son's innocence?

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.449
[sighs] See?

00:02:57.532 --> 00:02:59.701
It's impossible to set a price, right?

00:02:59.785 --> 00:03:01.703
[distorted] I don't want anything else.

00:03:02.788 --> 00:03:04.915
If you want your request to be fulfilled,

00:03:04.998 --> 00:03:07.626
all you have to do
is bring me Arleli's piece.

00:03:08.293 --> 00:03:09.294
If you refuse...

00:03:10.045 --> 00:03:11.713
consider your request denied.

00:03:12.631 --> 00:03:13.715
[cell phone beeps]

00:03:17.093 --> 00:03:18.094
[sighs]

00:03:23.225 --> 00:03:25.977
[auctioneer] Without further ado,
we will resume the auction.

00:03:26.061 --> 00:03:28.188
We left off at 3.5 billion won.

00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:29.981
Do I hear four billion?

00:03:31.483 --> 00:03:34.319
And we have bidder number 39
with four billion won.

00:03:34.402 --> 00:03:37.781
Our online bidder, do I have 4.5 billion?

00:03:40.992 --> 00:03:43.370
-There it is. 4.5 billion...
-[crowd murmuring]

00:03:43.453 --> 00:03:44.996
...from online bidder number 56.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.749
To our guest on the floor,
do I hear five billion?

00:03:48.583 --> 00:03:50.794
You need five billion to stay in the race.

00:03:50.877 --> 00:03:52.337
And we have five billion.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.923
Once again,
the floor now has the highest bid.

00:03:55.006 --> 00:03:58.843
To our online bidder,
do I hear 5.5 billion?

00:03:59.553 --> 00:04:03.306
And we have it. That is 5.5 billion won
from our online bidder.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.392
The highest bid is yours.

00:04:05.475 --> 00:04:06.601
[chuckles softly]

00:04:06.685 --> 00:04:08.979
To our guest. Six billion?

00:04:09.938 --> 00:04:13.191
Six billion. Bidder number 39,
I'll ask one last time.

00:04:13.942 --> 00:04:15.277
Do I hear six?

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.571
This piece can be yours for six billion.

00:04:18.238 --> 00:04:19.948
-Do we have it?
-[breathing heavily]

00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:21.449
Going once.

00:04:21.533 --> 00:04:23.159
[breath trembling]

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.413
Thank you, sir. Now, 6.5?

00:04:27.247 --> 00:04:30.375
Our online bidder? Do I have 6.5?

00:04:30.458 --> 00:04:31.835
No?

00:04:31.918 --> 00:04:35.547
If we don't hear from you,
we'll call it three times and close.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:36.631
Final chance.

00:04:37.757 --> 00:04:39.134
-Going once.
-[panting]

00:04:40.552 --> 00:04:41.803
Going twice.

00:04:43.054 --> 00:04:45.515
You hit your limit, haven't you?
That's no fun.

00:04:46.766 --> 00:04:50.729
[auctioneer] Sold to bidder number 39
on the floor for six billion won.

00:04:50.812 --> 00:04:51.980
Congratulations, sir.

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:04.177
Yes, Mr. Chairman. I received it.

00:06:05.887 --> 00:06:08.390
Ah, right.
I forgot to mention this earlier.

00:06:09.057 --> 00:06:11.643
The scapegoat who went to prison
for your son?

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.561
He's dead now.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.108
He shoved pages from a Bible in his mouth
and managed to suffocate himself.

00:06:19.818 --> 00:06:20.819
Didn't I tell you?

00:06:21.486 --> 00:06:23.655
I promised to make
this incident disappear.

00:06:25.907 --> 00:06:29.744
So now your son was never involved,
but I'm sure it's still bothering him.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.205
Why don't you two take a vacation?

00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:48.680
Building the data center
is a key national initiative.

00:06:48.763 --> 00:06:50.473
It would be good PR for us.

00:06:50.557 --> 00:06:52.851
We must do everything
in our power to win this bid.

00:06:52.934 --> 00:06:55.520
[man] Will this land acquisition costs
exceed our budget?

00:06:55.603 --> 00:06:56.938
By about 30 percent.

00:06:57.021 --> 00:06:59.733
[man exhales] It's too high
of a risk to go through with it.

00:06:59.816 --> 00:07:02.944
It's a national project, so we need
to consider more than cost alone.

00:07:03.027 --> 00:07:05.488
It won't matter what it is
if it bankrupts the company,

00:07:05.572 --> 00:07:06.990
We can't afford to pursue this.

00:07:07.073 --> 00:07:09.367
[man] Come on,
what information are you looking at?

00:07:09.451 --> 00:07:11.911
-Are we looking at the same data?

Yes?

00:07:23.006 --> 00:07:24.132
We've been compromised.

00:07:24.215 --> 00:07:25.425
I think we need cleanup.

00:07:26.968 --> 00:07:27.969
Okay.

00:07:28.052 --> 00:07:29.304
Send in the cleanup crew.

00:07:40.356 --> 00:07:42.317

Did I hear you say

00:09:02.188 --> 00:09:04.607
that "you'll pass"?
Like you have a choice?

Tteokbokki? Or jjajangmyeon?

00:12:58.174 --> 00:12:59.175
Tofu?

00:13:02.512 --> 00:13:03.513
What?

00:13:04.472 --> 00:13:06.099
[sighs] Nothing.

00:13:06.182 --> 00:13:07.475

00:13:23.533 --> 00:13:25.785
[Noh Yongsik] Oh, jeez. [laughs]

00:13:25.868 --> 00:13:28.037
You scared me, Father. Come on in.

00:13:28.746 --> 00:13:31.499
Why do you have guilt
written all over your face?

00:13:31.582 --> 00:13:33.000
Oh, it's nothing.

00:13:33.084 --> 00:13:35.420
Do you have a moment to talk right now?

00:13:35.503 --> 00:13:36.504
Sure.

00:13:38.506 --> 00:13:40.133
I'm here about Taejoong.

00:13:40.216 --> 00:13:42.343
Has there been some kind of accident or...

00:13:45.179 --> 00:13:46.722
This is mine.

00:13:50.184 --> 00:13:52.186
Don't tell me something happened to him.

00:13:54.856 --> 00:13:57.483
[inmate] Hey, what the hell
are you looking at?

00:13:57.567 --> 00:13:58.568
Eat your food.

00:13:58.651 --> 00:14:01.070
-[scrubbing]
-[inmate 2 whimpering]

00:14:01.154 --> 00:14:02.613
[grunts, whimpers]

00:14:06.325 --> 00:14:07.827
I swear I'll pay you back.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:11.205
[sobs] It's just that I need a little
more time. Please have mercy on me.

00:14:11.789 --> 00:14:13.457
[echoing] From now on,

00:14:13.541 --> 00:14:15.168
don't fuck with me.

00:14:18.754 --> 00:14:21.382
Ah, fucking shit.

00:14:21.465 --> 00:14:23.050
[inmate] Where you going, sir?

00:14:23.801 --> 00:14:24.927
[Deoksu] To take a piss.

00:14:33.811 --> 00:14:35.146
The vibe is so tense in here.

00:14:35.229 --> 00:14:37.815
Everybody's barely
touching their food today.

00:14:37.899 --> 00:14:39.317
You're clueless, aren't you?

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.861
-Didn't you hear what happened?
-No. What?

00:14:41.944 --> 00:14:44.572
The boss got spanked by 2802.

00:14:44.655 --> 00:14:45.781
Really?

00:14:45.865 --> 00:14:47.366
-He got beat up?
-Yeah.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:49.952
All he could do
was take it like a little bitch.

00:14:50.036 --> 00:14:52.246
That's why he's been hiding
behind his thugs.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:56.125
I guess we should take advantage of that
and eat our food in peace for once.

00:14:58.169 --> 00:14:59.420
It's nice.

00:14:59.503 --> 00:15:00.713
With them gone.

00:15:00.796 --> 00:15:01.881
The food tastes better.

00:15:01.964 --> 00:15:03.591
-It really does.
-[both laugh]

[grunting]

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:31.911
Hello, sir.

00:15:32.745 --> 00:15:34.121
[Gangjae] What's going on?

00:15:34.205 --> 00:15:36.332
-Deoksu is inside.
-[Deoksu grunting]

00:15:36.415 --> 00:15:37.875
[Gangjae] It's so fucking noisy.

[blows landing]

00:15:46.384 --> 00:15:48.052
Hey, Etch-a-Sketch. [screams]

00:15:48.844 --> 00:15:50.221
[inmate] Look who it is.

00:15:50.304 --> 00:15:51.806
What are you staring at? [grunts]

00:15:51.889 --> 00:15:53.766
[all grunting]

00:15:55.518 --> 00:15:57.979
-[inmates groaning]
-The fuck's he looking at?

00:15:58.062 --> 00:15:59.230
[Deoksu] Calm down, kids.

00:16:03.776 --> 00:16:04.986
Gangjae The Dickhead.

00:16:05.069 --> 00:16:06.654
Did you have a nice vacation?

00:16:06.737 --> 00:16:08.406
Long time no see.

00:16:08.489 --> 00:16:11.033
Why did you come back here?
Just to suck dick?

00:16:13.661 --> 00:16:16.122
Looks like you're still
getting your ass kicked.

00:16:24.547 --> 00:16:25.840
You've gotten weak, old man.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.552
[both laughing]

00:16:29.635 --> 00:16:31.053
[Namjoon] What's going on?

00:16:31.137 --> 00:16:33.306
Come on, break it up. Step away.

00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:34.557
What's this?

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.350
You two again. [sighs]

00:16:38.477 --> 00:16:39.478
These animals.

00:16:41.522 --> 00:16:42.857
You want to dig his grave?

00:16:43.649 --> 00:16:45.359
You can dig yours while you're at it.

00:16:45.443 --> 00:16:47.028
What? Am I gonna get a time out?

00:16:47.111 --> 00:16:48.112
Follow me.

00:16:48.654 --> 00:16:50.364
Quickly. The warden's waiting.

00:16:58.205 --> 00:16:59.206
Come in here.

00:17:08.215 --> 00:17:09.216
Fucking trash.

00:17:15.056 --> 00:17:17.058
This is supposed to be a fight club.

00:17:17.141 --> 00:17:18.601
Why isn't there any fighting?

00:17:19.852 --> 00:17:22.730
I didn't set this up
so you could make some pocket change.

00:17:23.773 --> 00:17:26.609
Listen, you need to have patience, sir.

00:17:27.443 --> 00:17:29.904
Scouting good talent takes time, you know.

00:17:29.987 --> 00:17:32.907
Yeah. And I heard you got
your ass kicked in the process.

00:17:34.075 --> 00:17:36.827
[scoffs] So the rumor
has already gotten to you.

00:17:37.411 --> 00:17:39.622
I'm the warden. I know everything.

00:17:42.166 --> 00:17:44.377
There's another rumor
making its way around.

00:17:45.211 --> 00:17:47.338
And I hope you enjoy
that one just as much.

00:17:51.175 --> 00:17:52.927
That's actually why I came to see you.

00:17:53.844 --> 00:17:54.845
Restrain yourself.

00:17:56.472 --> 00:17:59.558
We had a kid kill himself,
and now it's become a major headache.

00:18:00.559 --> 00:18:01.811
[sighs] Shit.

00:18:01.894 --> 00:18:03.729
It's nothing out of the ordinary.

00:18:05.189 --> 00:18:06.524
The timing's bad.

00:18:06.607 --> 00:18:08.734
One slip up is easy
to sweep under the rug,

00:18:08.818 --> 00:18:11.070
but two becomes a management issue.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.368
So what do you expect me to do?

00:18:19.495 --> 00:18:21.330
Sit back, relax and enjoy the sun?

00:18:22.498 --> 00:18:24.166
I've had enough of your complaining.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:25.876
Stop pouting like a little kid.

00:18:27.378 --> 00:18:28.379
That's a gift.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.759
It's a list of new inmates arriving soon.

00:18:33.843 --> 00:18:35.386
Two of them are white collar.

00:18:36.011 --> 00:18:39.724
They committed financial crimes
and their stashes were never found.

00:18:40.725 --> 00:18:42.393
Their pockets must be loaded.

00:18:42.977 --> 00:18:44.437
I assigned them to your cell.

00:18:45.771 --> 00:18:46.981
So suck them dry.

00:18:48.816 --> 00:18:50.609
Sounds like something you'd be into.

00:19:02.121 --> 00:19:04.373
-Hey.
-You cut your hair.

00:19:04.999 --> 00:19:06.167
Yeah. [chuckles]

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:07.334
Is it weird?

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:09.211
No, it looks nice.

00:19:10.129 --> 00:19:12.423
Have you been to the commissary?

00:19:12.506 --> 00:19:14.925
They added so many new things
since my time here.

00:19:15.009 --> 00:19:17.845
Oh, so instead of seeing me first,
that's where you went?

00:19:18.471 --> 00:19:20.014
Oh, and while I was there,

00:19:20.097 --> 00:19:22.933
I bought the best supplements
with the most vitamins for you.

00:19:23.017 --> 00:19:26.187
-Make sure to take them every day.
-How's your repair shop?

00:19:26.729 --> 00:19:28.481
-Is everything going well?
-Mmm-hmm.

00:19:29.398 --> 00:19:30.775
It's really taking off.

00:19:30.858 --> 00:19:32.485
Do you want some spending money?

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.071
Father came by.

00:19:36.155 --> 00:19:39.241
He visited me at my store
saying he was worried about you.

00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:41.660
I see. That's why you're here.

00:19:42.286 --> 00:19:44.580
But judging by that smile, you seem fine.

00:19:44.663 --> 00:19:46.832
Is there anything going on with you?

00:19:49.084 --> 00:19:51.462
-What do you mean by that?
-For example...

00:19:53.464 --> 00:19:55.341
you might be hearing a voice questioning

00:19:55.424 --> 00:19:58.219
what the point of life is
when you're caged up like this.

00:19:58.844 --> 00:20:00.429
And maybe it's not worth living.

00:20:01.889 --> 00:20:02.932
Never crossed my mind.

00:20:04.266 --> 00:20:05.267
That's good to hear.

00:20:06.143 --> 00:20:08.354
And there's no one giving you
a hard time, right?

00:20:08.437 --> 00:20:09.438
Right.

00:20:11.524 --> 00:20:15.778
I spend too much time in my garden
and I'm really getting sick of the view.

00:20:15.861 --> 00:20:18.489
But now I'm ready for something different.

00:20:20.449 --> 00:20:21.742
What are you implying?

00:20:27.706 --> 00:20:28.707
Taejoong.

00:20:30.251 --> 00:20:31.752
Don't be stupid.

00:20:32.628 --> 00:20:34.004
Hey, listen, Mr. Noh.

00:20:38.884 --> 00:20:40.219
I swear I'm innocent.

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:49.395
I'm getting out of this prison.

00:20:57.027 --> 00:21:00.948
[Jaedeok] You're not going to let
Park Taejoong get away with this, are you?

00:21:01.031 --> 00:21:03.784
All those assholes
are talking shit behind our backs.

00:21:03.868 --> 00:21:05.202
My hands are tied.

00:21:07.162 --> 00:21:08.789
The warden told me to back off.

00:21:10.708 --> 00:21:11.709
So I'm gonna.

00:21:12.668 --> 00:21:14.295
[blows landing]

[panting]

00:21:32.855 --> 00:21:34.648
I might have to hold back...

00:21:36.191 --> 00:21:38.986
but I can't bring myself to tell you to.

00:21:39.069 --> 00:21:41.113
So go and have some fun for me.

00:21:41.196 --> 00:21:42.281
I won't let you down.

All right. Time to get to work, everyone.

CELL BLOCK A

00:22:28.494 --> 00:22:29.495
SUPPLY STORAGE ROOM

00:22:29.578 --> 00:22:31.538
[Taejoong] I'll need civilian clothes.

00:22:36.168 --> 00:22:38.087
Security key cards for door access.

00:22:42.216 --> 00:22:44.635
[Chajoong] There's nothing new
going on with Block 7.

00:22:44.718 --> 00:22:46.762
And zero to report
with the workshop as well.

00:22:46.845 --> 00:22:47.846
Got it.

00:22:49.223 --> 00:22:51.308
[Taejoong] The guards change
shifts at 3:30.

00:22:51.392 --> 00:22:53.227
That's when I need to make my move.

00:22:54.144 --> 00:22:56.563
Zone B has the door
that leads to the outside.

00:22:57.398 --> 00:23:00.359
I have to find a way to sneak in there
without the guards noticing

00:23:01.151 --> 00:23:02.736
and utilize the ventilation ducts.

00:23:05.614 --> 00:23:08.200
END OF VISITING HOURS

00:23:09.994 --> 00:23:12.413
Visitation hours end promptly at 4:00 p.m.

00:23:16.291 --> 00:23:19.253
And that's when
the food supply truck comes too.

00:23:19.336 --> 00:23:21.964
So four's when my window closes. [gasps]

00:23:37.312 --> 00:23:38.313
[lock clicks]

00:23:41.525 --> 00:23:43.652
Let's save the introductions for tomorrow.

[grunting]

00:24:37.081 --> 00:24:39.041
I was gonna make it quick for you.

00:24:39.124 --> 00:24:40.250
Who sent you?

00:24:40.334 --> 00:24:41.710
Does it matter?

00:24:42.294 --> 00:24:44.838
Come on, I want to hear you scream.
"Someone help!"

00:24:44.922 --> 00:24:45.923
"Someone save me!"

00:24:48.258 --> 00:24:49.426
Let's get on with it.

00:24:50.177 --> 00:24:51.178
Okay.

00:24:51.845 --> 00:24:54.014
[both grunting]

00:25:11.824 --> 00:25:12.991
[guard] Roll call!

00:25:43.605 --> 00:25:46.859
[Taejoong] There's one final obstacle
that I need to overcome.

00:26:03.125 --> 00:26:04.209
Keep eating.

00:26:04.293 --> 00:26:05.294
Okay.

00:26:08.005 --> 00:26:09.673
All this shit you're doing...

00:26:10.465 --> 00:26:12.092
having fun?

00:26:12.176 --> 00:26:13.719
Does it look like I am?

00:26:13.802 --> 00:26:15.304
Let's give it a rest.

00:26:15.387 --> 00:26:16.638
If you stop now,

00:26:17.222 --> 00:26:19.433
I'll forgive everything
you've done to me so far.

00:26:19.516 --> 00:26:21.143
Forgive me?

00:26:21.226 --> 00:26:23.103
Who the fuck do you think you are?

00:26:23.187 --> 00:26:24.855
I should ask for forgiveness?

00:26:26.648 --> 00:26:28.025
[inhales] Let's see.

00:26:28.108 --> 00:26:31.069
You know, that's not gonna happen
just because you want it to.

00:26:32.738 --> 00:26:33.739
Tell you what?

00:26:34.698 --> 00:26:36.783
If you want me to ask for forgiveness,

00:26:36.867 --> 00:26:39.870
why don't you chop your dick off
and then go fuck yourself?

00:26:39.953 --> 00:26:40.996
Then I'll consider it.

00:26:46.335 --> 00:26:48.712
Wasn't your little sister sexually abused?

00:26:53.592 --> 00:26:54.885
It was you, wasn't it?

00:26:55.969 --> 00:26:57.262
You don't have to lie.

00:26:57.346 --> 00:26:59.932
You enjoyed it, didn't you?

00:27:00.015 --> 00:27:01.516
[grunts]

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.477
[breathing heavily]

00:27:06.855 --> 00:27:08.273
[grunts]

00:27:08.899 --> 00:27:09.983
Ah!

00:27:13.904 --> 00:27:16.073
-[grunting]
-[groans]

00:27:22.955 --> 00:27:24.373
[guard] Hey! Back up!

00:27:24.456 --> 00:27:25.874
Stop right now!

00:27:25.958 --> 00:27:27.459
Come on!

00:27:27.542 --> 00:27:29.795
[guards grunting]

00:27:33.757 --> 00:27:35.467
Taser! Taser! Taser!

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:37.594
[Cheolhwan] What the hell's going on?

00:27:37.678 --> 00:27:38.679
Move!

00:27:39.638 --> 00:27:41.056
Lay him down on the ground.

00:27:41.139 --> 00:27:42.140
What happened?

00:27:43.016 --> 00:27:44.559
[Deoksu groaning]

00:27:46.311 --> 00:27:47.312
You okay?

00:27:48.939 --> 00:27:50.107
[groans softly]

00:27:51.858 --> 00:27:52.859
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:27:53.944 --> 00:27:55.362
Let's get you to the infirmary.

00:27:55.445 --> 00:27:56.488
No, it's okay.

00:27:57.531 --> 00:27:59.116
I'm all good. But this guy...

00:27:59.199 --> 00:28:00.867
I think he might need a visit there.

00:28:05.163 --> 00:28:06.540
And that takes care of him.

00:28:12.671 --> 00:28:14.548
He seems like fun. [chuckles]

00:28:25.475 --> 00:28:27.894
So the inmate
who assaulted you was punished.

00:28:28.645 --> 00:28:29.771
Solitary confinement.

00:28:31.523 --> 00:28:32.524
Although...

00:28:33.108 --> 00:28:34.693
if you think that's too lenient,

00:28:35.861 --> 00:28:38.238
you can bring it up
to the Ministry of Justice.

00:28:38.321 --> 00:28:39.698
It's not that serious.

00:28:43.869 --> 00:28:46.496
I can't seem to figure you out. Hmm.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.999
What will it take for you
to raise a complaint?

00:28:49.541 --> 00:28:50.625
Maybe you never will.

00:28:53.045 --> 00:28:54.046
Here.

00:28:54.671 --> 00:28:56.840
I don't know if this is
what you requested.

00:28:56.923 --> 00:28:59.384
I asked for a green sponge
and they gave me that.

00:29:00.343 --> 00:29:01.553
No, this is perfect.

00:29:01.636 --> 00:29:04.097
I want to decorate the chapel
with some flowers.

00:29:04.181 --> 00:29:05.348
Oh, sounds nice.

00:29:05.432 --> 00:29:08.060
What's the point of flowers,
if you can't share them.

00:29:09.061 --> 00:29:11.021
I can get you anything else you need.

00:29:11.104 --> 00:29:12.731
-Just let me know.
-Thank you, sir.

00:29:13.607 --> 00:29:14.733
Oh, right.

00:29:14.816 --> 00:29:17.569
I saw that you applied
for cleaning duty in Zone B.

00:29:18.737 --> 00:29:21.198
We can't transfer you
unless there's an opening.

00:29:22.115 --> 00:29:23.200
But the way I see it,

00:29:24.159 --> 00:29:25.869
Zone A is easier to clean anyways.

00:29:26.953 --> 00:29:28.163
It's best to stay there.

00:29:55.482 --> 00:29:56.483
What's this?

00:29:57.442 --> 00:29:59.861
I'm running errands for Officer Yang.

00:29:59.945 --> 00:30:00.946
Really?

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:03.323
-Go on.
-Yes, sir.

00:30:29.391 --> 00:30:30.392
Lights out soon.

00:30:35.689 --> 00:30:38.525
Hey, should I be ready for round two?

00:30:39.234 --> 00:30:40.360
Nah, don't worry.

00:30:40.443 --> 00:30:44.364
After you slapped the shit out of me,
he just said to monitor you. So, yeah.

00:30:46.283 --> 00:30:47.284
Why did he send you?

00:30:48.034 --> 00:30:49.035
Is there a reason?

00:30:52.038 --> 00:30:53.498
I'm good at ambushing people,

00:30:53.582 --> 00:30:56.585
but with you, well,
we both know how that turned out.

00:31:00.505 --> 00:31:02.299
[inmate] I wish I didn't have to work.

00:31:02.382 --> 00:31:04.217
-Seriously.
-Let's get this over with.

00:31:04.301 --> 00:31:06.178
-We should get going.
-[quiet laughter]

00:31:06.261 --> 00:31:08.096
Go ahead. I need one more.

00:31:12.058 --> 00:31:13.059
[sighs wearily]

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:15.687
Making a living is hard in here, too.

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:17.230
[screams]

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:19.316
[panting]

00:31:22.819 --> 00:31:25.447
Where's inmate 7423?

00:31:26.698 --> 00:31:28.325
Any volunteers for Zone B?

00:31:29.201 --> 00:31:30.744
Sure. I don't mind, sir.

00:31:32.495 --> 00:31:33.788
CELL BLOCK B

00:31:47.177 --> 00:31:48.220
[blows]

00:33:01.293 --> 00:33:02.919
You got here earlier than expected.

00:33:04.379 --> 00:33:05.380
Welcome.

00:33:11.678 --> 00:33:13.888
First round of vaccines for 250 inmates.

00:33:13.972 --> 00:33:14.973
Right.

00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:16.891
Come with me.

00:33:42.876 --> 00:33:45.378
These are the inmates scheduled for today.

00:33:46.046 --> 00:33:47.422
Medical records are separated.

00:33:48.882 --> 00:33:51.134
We can proceed whenever you're ready.

00:33:51.217 --> 00:33:52.218
I'll let them know.

00:33:55.597 --> 00:33:58.850
[door opens and closes]

00:34:01.102 --> 00:34:03.563
2802 - PARK TAEJOONG

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:18.703
-[exhales]
-All right, everyone, listen up.

00:34:20.121 --> 00:34:21.831
We've got vaccinations today.

00:34:21.915 --> 00:34:23.917
Head to the infirmary after lunch.

00:34:24.793 --> 00:34:26.211
Hurry up, you guys.

00:34:26.294 --> 00:34:27.462
Come on, move out.

00:34:29.172 --> 00:34:30.173
All right, go.

00:34:31.883 --> 00:34:33.385
-[beeping]
-What's that?

00:34:33.468 --> 00:34:34.552
What are you hiding?

00:34:37.305 --> 00:34:39.015
You know you can't take that. Hey!

00:34:39.849 --> 00:34:41.059
Why are you still working?

00:34:41.142 --> 00:34:42.685
We can't eat yet because of you.

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:03.123
Sorry to make you do this.

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.042
Are you sure you're okay skipping lunch?

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:09.504
Yeah. I won't have time
if I don't do it now.

00:35:09.587 --> 00:35:13.049
It started making weird noises recently,
and I can't figure it out.

00:35:16.094 --> 00:35:18.471
I'll have it fixed
by the time you finish lunch.

00:35:19.347 --> 00:35:21.266
I'll bring you a burger for your trouble.

00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:22.892
After you eat, go get vaccinated.

00:35:23.685 --> 00:35:25.437
-Okay. Sounds good.
-Hmm.

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.521
Thanks, bud.

00:35:31.443 --> 00:35:32.444
[guard] Let's go.

00:35:56.843 --> 00:35:58.470
[electric saw whirring]

00:36:18.406 --> 00:36:19.949
Hey, you done?

00:36:20.033 --> 00:36:21.034
Get some coffee.

00:36:21.117 --> 00:36:22.952
Not now. I gotta go make a delivery.

00:37:01.115 --> 00:37:02.659
What the hell is that noise?

00:37:04.828 --> 00:37:06.329
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

00:37:06.412 --> 00:37:08.498
I never said you could
mess around in here.

00:37:13.837 --> 00:37:15.004
Already finished lunch?

00:37:16.506 --> 00:37:21.302
Well, I took a look under the hood,
and for the most part, everything is fine.

00:37:21.386 --> 00:37:23.596
But I think the issue
is with this damper pulley,

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.139
which is why I made this. But...

00:37:26.057 --> 00:37:27.809
you might still have to replace it.

00:37:31.896 --> 00:37:34.357
So will I be safe
to drive for long distances?

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:35.817
-[tool clattering]
-I think so.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.319
The noise is gone for now,
but you should still get it

00:37:38.403 --> 00:37:40.238
-checked out later.
-Thanks for the help.

00:37:40.321 --> 00:37:41.906
-Here's your burger.
-Right.

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.991
Thank you.

00:37:44.033 --> 00:37:45.952
[car door opens, closes]

00:37:46.035 --> 00:37:48.371
-[knocks hood]
-All right. I'm gonna head back.

00:37:49.706 --> 00:37:51.583
[engine starts]

00:37:53.918 --> 00:37:55.295
[guard] Hey, hold on.

00:37:55.378 --> 00:37:56.379
[door closes]

00:37:58.715 --> 00:37:59.716
You can't leave yet.

00:38:08.308 --> 00:38:09.309
Arms up.

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:30.496
Okay, go on.

00:38:31.289 --> 00:38:32.290
Thanks again.

00:38:53.186 --> 00:38:56.272
[breathing heavily]

00:39:12.497 --> 00:39:14.874
What's up, man? Do Gangjae.

00:39:18.086 --> 00:39:20.964
You better answer
when he talks to you, you fucking prick.

00:39:24.384 --> 00:39:27.303
Why did you ruin the vibe
when we were just having introductions?

00:39:31.224 --> 00:39:32.392
Sorry about that.

00:39:34.143 --> 00:39:35.520
I'm a little busy right now.

00:39:35.603 --> 00:39:38.064
You want to kill Deoksu
as much as I do, right?

00:39:39.607 --> 00:39:40.775
[exhales]

00:39:42.527 --> 00:39:43.861
You want to team up with me?

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:45.571
No, thank you.

00:39:46.739 --> 00:39:48.950
It's embarrassing
if you refuse so quickly.

00:39:49.575 --> 00:39:51.911
If you're not with us, you're against us.

00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:54.330
So choose wisely.

00:39:57.959 --> 00:39:58.960
See you around.

00:39:59.877 --> 00:40:00.878
Enjoy your food.

00:40:01.671 --> 00:40:02.672
[chuckles lightly]

00:40:06.634 --> 00:40:08.386
-What you got there?
-[grunts]

00:40:12.557 --> 00:40:13.599
Hey, let him go.

00:40:24.527 --> 00:40:25.570
[exhales]

00:40:25.653 --> 00:40:27.113
What an asshole!

00:40:27.196 --> 00:40:28.906
I want him so fucking bad.

00:40:36.539 --> 00:40:39.792
[Noh Yongsik] I don't think you truly
understand what you're up against.

00:40:39.876 --> 00:40:42.795
In order to get here,
I had to drive over two mountains.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:46.883
And when I arrived,
I had to pass through three entrances.

00:40:47.592 --> 00:40:50.970
One of them even had armed guards
stationed in a watchtower.

00:40:51.054 --> 00:40:53.431
I'm trying to make it
perfectly clear to you

00:40:53.514 --> 00:40:56.059
about how impossible of a task this is.

00:40:56.142 --> 00:40:58.853
It's not a matter of climbing
over a wall or two.

00:41:00.063 --> 00:41:02.273
[Taejoong] I'm not climbing
over any walls.

00:41:04.525 --> 00:41:06.444
I'm walking out the front door.

00:41:20.541 --> 00:41:22.418
[Namjoon] Shut the door behind you.

00:41:22.502 --> 00:41:23.961
[distant chatter]

00:41:31.677 --> 00:41:33.387
Why the hell are you so late?

00:41:36.099 --> 00:41:37.350
Skipped the vaccine, right?

00:41:38.434 --> 00:41:39.435
Yeah.

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:48.111
You're all set.

00:41:50.947 --> 00:41:52.323
[nurse] You're Park Taejoong?

00:41:52.406 --> 00:41:54.033
-Number 2802?
-[inmate] Yes.

00:41:54.117 --> 00:41:55.243
Have a seat.

00:42:05.795 --> 00:42:07.046
Listen up.

00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:10.508
There's a big match tomorrow...

00:42:12.135 --> 00:42:13.970
and I need you in top shape,

00:42:14.053 --> 00:42:16.973
so I sent somebody else
to get the vaccine in your place.

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:22.520
2802, Park Taejoong.

00:42:27.066 --> 00:42:28.860
Hurry up and get it over with.

00:42:28.943 --> 00:42:30.027
I have shit to do.

00:42:33.239 --> 00:42:34.907
I bet a lot of money on you,

00:42:35.616 --> 00:42:36.868
so you better win.

00:42:40.913 --> 00:42:41.914
See you tomorrow.

00:42:46.544 --> 00:42:48.379
[sighs] Fuck me.

00:42:55.595 --> 00:42:56.596
Hey.

00:42:57.763 --> 00:42:59.599
Ready? It's go time.

00:43:00.224 --> 00:43:02.185
Come on, hurry!

00:43:11.652 --> 00:43:13.571
[inmate] Give me one more. Come on!

00:43:13.654 --> 00:43:15.281
-Hell, yeah!
-Get out of the way.

00:43:15.364 --> 00:43:16.574
[inmate] Officer.

00:43:16.657 --> 00:43:18.910
If anything goes wrong,
the blame's on you.

00:43:18.993 --> 00:43:20.870
Sir, you shouldn't worry so much.

00:43:20.953 --> 00:43:22.955
If it goes wrong, it's my fault.

00:43:23.039 --> 00:43:26.042
And if it goes well,
it's all thanks to you and you alone.

00:43:26.125 --> 00:43:28.044
[scoffs] I love ass kissers like you.

00:43:28.127 --> 00:43:30.421
I'm gonna take a smoke break
till everyone's ready.

00:43:30.504 --> 00:43:32.423
-Okay, you got it, sir.
-All right.

00:43:39.055 --> 00:43:40.097
[exhales]

00:43:43.851 --> 00:43:46.479
The officers are gonna be so happy
you're part of this.

00:43:46.562 --> 00:43:48.439
Look how jealous those guys are.

00:43:48.522 --> 00:43:51.359
He's with us, you fucking assholes.

00:43:51.442 --> 00:43:53.736
I told you I wasn't interested.

00:43:54.362 --> 00:43:56.405
Well, I don't think
that's really up to you.

00:43:58.699 --> 00:43:59.700
Don't you see?

00:44:00.326 --> 00:44:03.204
Those fuckers won't stop
when the match is called.

00:44:05.081 --> 00:44:06.457
You gotta win at all costs.

00:44:09.001 --> 00:44:10.836
If you don't want to end up in solitary.

00:44:12.046 --> 00:44:13.256
Why's he going over there?

00:44:13.339 --> 00:44:14.674
Leave him be.

00:44:14.757 --> 00:44:16.133
He's still on our team, right?

00:44:16.217 --> 00:44:17.218
[both grunting]

00:44:17.301 --> 00:44:18.302
Hey, hey.

00:44:19.262 --> 00:44:20.429
-[grunts]
-[inmate 1] Hey!

00:44:20.513 --> 00:44:22.431
[inmate 2] Do you even know
what you doing?

00:44:22.515 --> 00:44:23.641
Are you fucking crazy?

00:44:23.724 --> 00:44:25.142
The warden will kill us.

00:44:25.726 --> 00:44:27.603
Get your ass back here, Taejoong.

00:44:27.687 --> 00:44:28.688
Satisfied?

00:44:29.272 --> 00:44:30.273
I won, right?

00:44:31.023 --> 00:44:32.858
You son of a bitch! You ruined it!

00:44:32.942 --> 00:44:34.360
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

00:44:34.443 --> 00:44:35.611
Taejoong! Come back!

00:44:35.695 --> 00:44:36.696
Sir, no wait.

00:44:36.779 --> 00:44:38.531
[indistinct shouting]

00:44:49.417 --> 00:44:51.168
Oh, there he is.

00:45:02.847 --> 00:45:06.475
They noticed someone missed their vaccine
and realized it was you.

00:45:07.643 --> 00:45:08.644
All right.

00:45:10.855 --> 00:45:13.065
Please state your inmate number and name.

00:45:13.149 --> 00:45:14.608
2802, Park Taejoong.

00:45:19.864 --> 00:45:21.866
Perfect. Can you roll up
your sleeve for me?

00:45:36.505 --> 00:45:39.258
Don't worry, it'll all be over
before you know it.

00:45:54.815 --> 00:45:56.233
[Taejoong] Thirty minutes left.

00:46:02.865 --> 00:46:04.784
