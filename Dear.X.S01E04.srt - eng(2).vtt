DEAR X

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:55.722
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:57.432
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:03.855
Ah Jin.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:07.609
Help me.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.294
You've woken up.

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:31.966
It would've been better
if you hadn't woken up at all.

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:37.097
Seeing you alive
wasn't part of my plan.

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:53.279
Dad.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.952
You understand me, don't you?

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:09.129
Even if you don't,
there's nothing I can do.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.641
You're the one who made me this way.

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:28.773
Think of this as your punishment
for ruining my childhood.

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:31.568
Repay me...

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:35.405
with your death.

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:40.368
Dad?

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:53.506
Goodbye.

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:58.887
I hope we never see each other again,
not even in Hell.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:50.438
EPISODE 4: NO TURNING BACK

00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:53.107
The bag.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.739
- Could you also check the bathroom?
- Excuse me.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:31.229
ST. JOSEPH'S UNIVERSITY
SEONGSIM HOSPITAL

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:36.234
The patient is awake.

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:37.318
Thank you.

00:04:43.157 --> 00:04:45.326
Are you saying that your father,
Baek Seon Gyu

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.830
died because Choi Jung Ho
attacked him?

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:52.792
Yes.

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:54.460
I see.

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:59.549
Baek Ah Jin claims that you hit
Baek Seon Gyu with a baseball bat.

00:05:00.174 --> 00:05:01.301
Is that true?

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.721
That baseball bat
is also yours, correct?

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:09.851
The bat's mine...

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:14.772
but I thought he was a stalker.

00:05:15.356 --> 00:05:19.193
You knew he was a stalker
even in the dark?

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.782
A man wearing a beanie
was choking Ah Jin.

00:05:25.908 --> 00:05:27.827
I charged at him, and in the scuffle

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:31.873
I swung the baseball bat
without even realizing it.

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.628
I swear I didn't mean
for that to happen.

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:39.464
A beanie?

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:44.093
A man in a beige beanie
was stalking Ah Jin.

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:48.181
When I saw him in that beanie
at Ah Jin's yesterday

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:50.475
I thought he was that stalker.

00:05:55.938 --> 00:05:59.442
We didn't find a beanie at the scene.
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:04.614
I'm telling you the truth.

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:09.660
He was wearing a beige beanie.

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:13.623
It was the same one
that Ah Jin's stalker wore.

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:16.000
A beanie?

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:21.589
I never saw anything like that.

00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:26.552
I don't know what Mr. Choi saw.

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:32.225
You saw him bleeding
after you hit him with your bat

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:35.144
and you just ran home.
That's what you did, right?

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:37.814
Ah Jin!

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:39.565
You son of a bitch!

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:44.654
My father lunged at Mr. Choi
with a pair of scissors.

00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:06.467
And Mr. Choi was holding a bat.

00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:12.890
Hey.

00:07:21.023 --> 00:07:22.024
Are you okay?

00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:25.027
Shit.

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:30.908
Mr. Choi.

00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:34.495
Don't.

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:36.497
What are you saying?

00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:42.795
Stalker or not,
the man is losing a lot of blood.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.341
Mr. Choi!

00:07:49.343 --> 00:07:50.386
Please don't.

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:53.639
That man isn't my stalker.

00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:55.766
He's my father.

00:08:02.398 --> 00:08:04.066
He's my father.

00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:09.780
That man is my father.

00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:10.865
Your father?

00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:16.954
There was no way of knowing

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.833
what my father would do
when he woke up.

00:08:24.837 --> 00:08:27.131
Mr. Choi, go home for now.

00:08:28.674 --> 00:08:31.969
I'll... I'll handle this mess.

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:34.931
You should go. Please leave.

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:38.392
Do you want to make things worse?

00:08:39.393 --> 00:08:41.354
Leave now!

00:08:41.437 --> 00:08:43.606
I can call for help after you leave

00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:46.025
so go.

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:47.360
Go!

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:09.924
It's just...

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:12.718
It's...

00:09:14.136 --> 00:09:15.304
Ah Jin...

00:09:51.215 --> 00:09:53.217
I thought making him leave...

00:09:55.928 --> 00:09:57.888
was the right call.

00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:02.476
So it's true you fled the scene
of the incident, correct?

00:10:05.396 --> 00:10:06.606
Yes.

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:08.190
I panicked at the time.

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:11.569
A reasonable person wouldn't have
fled the scene in that situation.

00:10:11.652 --> 00:10:14.113
By then, the victim
must've been incapacitated.

00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:17.658
I honestly don't know

00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:20.995
why I did any of that.

00:10:22.204 --> 00:10:23.456
It felt like

00:10:24.665 --> 00:10:26.917
I was under
some kind of spell yesterday.

00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:31.005
As if I were a puppet
in someone's master plan.

00:10:31.505 --> 00:10:34.759
Let's not make this complicated.
Keep it simple, okay?

00:10:37.428 --> 00:10:39.889
Baek Ah Jin became an orphan
at the age of 20

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:41.724
because of you.

00:10:42.224 --> 00:10:44.644
If you witnessed a crime,
you should've reported it.

00:10:44.727 --> 00:10:45.936
Not played the hero.

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:47.480
I'm sorry.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:50.775
I'm so sorry.

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:01.327
Sir.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.121
Thanks.

00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:06.248
BAEK SEON GYU, MALE, AGE 48

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:08.042
Baek Seon Gyu's
estimated time of death

00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:10.670
is between 9 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.
on the 19th.

00:11:10.753 --> 00:11:13.339
Meanwhile, you called for help

00:11:14.548 --> 00:11:15.633
at 3 a.m.

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:22.181
Why didn't you call for help
right away?

00:11:27.853 --> 00:11:29.980
Oh, dear. Let me help you.

00:11:34.902 --> 00:11:36.112
I...

00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:39.532
I passed out
when my father beat me up.

00:11:40.741 --> 00:11:42.159
I called for help

00:11:43.494 --> 00:11:47.373
as soon as I regained consciousness.

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:51.252
After that, I passed out again.

00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:52.795
Goodness.

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:56.966
No matter what you did,
he had no right to lay a hand on you.

00:11:58.092 --> 00:11:59.677
Seriously...

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.679
There's something wrong
with people these days.

00:12:01.762 --> 00:12:06.100
You rub them the wrong way,
and they lash out, even kill.

00:12:08.644 --> 00:12:12.606
You never thought about running away?

00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:15.317
Detective.

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:16.402
Yes?

00:12:16.485 --> 00:12:20.114
I'm exhausted right now.

00:12:24.034 --> 00:12:26.620
Do you have
any more questions for me?

00:12:33.836 --> 00:12:34.837
Hello?

00:12:35.337 --> 00:12:36.964
Yes, I'm the lead detective.

00:12:37.673 --> 00:12:38.674
Who?

00:12:39.717 --> 00:12:42.887
PB Agency, CEO Im Seung Yong?

00:12:44.805 --> 00:12:45.890
Hold on.

00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:49.268
I see.

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:58.068
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:00.237
- I come bearing good news.
- Hello.

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:02.823
He's Im Seung Yong, CEO of PB Agency.

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:05.326
Mr. Choi might be signing
a new contract.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.375
- Sergeant Ham, a minute?
- Yes, sir.

00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:47.910
Choi Jung Ho hit him with the bat.
He confessed.

00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:51.580
But he's claiming
it was self-defense.

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:53.374
- It was her.
- What?

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:57.044
He beat her constantly.
Of course, she wanted him dead.

00:13:57.127 --> 00:13:58.754
I'd want him dead if I were her.

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:02.341
She's got the clearest motive.

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:05.427
What more reason do you need?

00:14:06.178 --> 00:14:08.430
What looked like an impulsive killing

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:10.349
by a former baseball player
making a comeback

00:14:11.141 --> 00:14:12.977
turned out to be something else.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.604
A tragic story about a girl

00:14:15.688 --> 00:14:17.481
who was driven to kill her father

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:19.984
after enduring years of abuse.

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:23.779
Baek Ah Jin will get off
because of extenuating circumstances.

00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:26.782
So we'll draw attention
using Choi Jung Ho.

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:29.869
That'll give him a way out,
and we can wrap up our case.

00:14:29.952 --> 00:14:32.246
It's a win-win situation, okay?

00:14:32.663 --> 00:14:33.664
Sir, but that's...

00:14:33.747 --> 00:14:34.957
Come on.

00:14:35.916 --> 00:14:38.544
It'll be fine, so grow a pair.

00:14:38.627 --> 00:14:39.670
Hey.

00:14:40.754 --> 00:14:44.008
What's a young girl like her
going to do anyway?

00:14:44.842 --> 00:14:45.843
Keep an eye on her.

00:14:46.635 --> 00:14:47.636
Don't let her run.

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:49.555
Yes, sir.

00:14:54.143 --> 00:14:56.562
Reporter Kim, you picked up fast.

00:14:57.688 --> 00:14:59.815
Do you know Choi Jung Ho,
the baseball player?

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:02.318
Yes, the guy who retired
because of Kwak Eun Hyeok.

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:04.570
That's the one!

00:15:05.112 --> 00:15:07.197
Right. You won't believe this.

00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:12.286
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:18.584
Please come by the station later
to give a brief witness statement.

00:15:19.376 --> 00:15:22.713
What will happen to Mr. Choi?

00:15:22.796 --> 00:15:26.008
Mr. Choi keeps insisting
it was self-defense.

00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:27.927
But he admitted to the assault.

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:29.845
He'll go to trial

00:15:30.638 --> 00:15:32.765
and if he's unlucky,
he could end up doing time.

00:15:34.516 --> 00:15:37.394
I'm sorry about your father.

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:40.731
I hope you get well soon. Take care.

00:15:51.742 --> 00:15:54.244
No, we're framing it
as an accidental homicide.

00:15:55.579 --> 00:15:58.332
So just build a story around that.

00:15:59.416 --> 00:16:02.336
You're the first person
I called with this scoop.

00:16:03.712 --> 00:16:04.713
Exactly.

00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:28.904
VITAMIN DRINK

00:16:34.576 --> 00:16:35.661
The personal details of Baek

00:16:35.744 --> 00:16:39.415
the victim in the Nojeong-dong
Rooftop Murder Case

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:43.711
have spread online,
drawing public attention.

00:16:43.794 --> 00:16:47.589
After serving five years in prison,
Baek was released in 2016.

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:49.383
Unable to find a steady job

00:16:49.466 --> 00:16:52.469
he visited his daughter's home,
where he was killed.

00:16:53.262 --> 00:16:55.973
Choi, a former baseball player
now being questioned

00:16:56.056 --> 00:16:57.808
for Baek's murder

00:16:57.891 --> 00:17:00.602
allegedly attacked him
at his daughter's house.

00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:02.438
The daughter worked part-time
at Choi's cafe...

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.462
ST. JOSEPH'S UNIVERSITY
SEONGSIM HOSPITAL

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.888
Ms. Baek, hold on a moment.

00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:22.101
Please come to the station with us.

00:18:23.393 --> 00:18:27.147
You are now a suspect
in the murder of Baek Seon Gyu.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.733
You have the right to remain silent.

00:18:29.817 --> 00:18:31.902
Anything you say
can and will be used against you.

00:18:31.985 --> 00:18:33.654
You have the right to an attorney.

00:18:55.384 --> 00:18:57.177
What are you suggesting?

00:18:57.261 --> 00:19:00.222
We'll spin it as you
taking justice into your own hands

00:19:00.305 --> 00:19:02.766
after being set up
by that part-timer.

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:04.434
We'll flood the media
with that angle.

00:19:04.726 --> 00:19:06.645
If the court rules it as self-defense

00:19:06.728 --> 00:19:08.063
you might dodge jail time.

00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:10.023
Then...

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:12.776
What about Ah Jin?

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:13.861
The part-timer?

00:19:13.944 --> 00:19:15.028
She'll probably do time.

00:19:18.782 --> 00:19:22.202
Why are you worried about her?
It's your ass on the line!

00:19:24.496 --> 00:19:26.498
Don't complicate things.

00:19:26.582 --> 00:19:29.126
She has no one to turn to,
so I feel bad for her.

00:19:29.459 --> 00:19:33.797
But another charge on her record
won't affect her life.

00:19:33.881 --> 00:19:35.090
Not you, though.

00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:38.802
You're trying to make a comeback,
and doing time will ruin your life.

00:19:42.389 --> 00:19:44.725
I've even settled things
with the lead detective.

00:19:44.808 --> 00:19:47.186
Fortunately, with the new evidence
found at the scene

00:19:47.269 --> 00:19:49.479
that girl is now the prime suspect

00:19:49.563 --> 00:19:51.440
which works to our advantage.

00:19:52.357 --> 00:19:55.944
The detective said
he'd make her confess

00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:58.197
before he hands her over
to the prosecution.

00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:00.532
So don't worry.

00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:17.466
Le Na?

00:20:18.008 --> 00:20:19.009
Le Na!

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:23.430
Hyang I turned herself in
and said it was her fault.

00:20:24.306 --> 00:20:27.434
You're just here to give a statement,
so watch what you say.

00:20:29.019 --> 00:20:32.022
What about the dash cam and the CCTV?

00:20:33.523 --> 00:20:34.691
What if I get caught?

00:20:35.025 --> 00:20:36.235
That's been taken care of.

00:20:37.527 --> 00:20:40.739
There wasn't anyone around,
so no one saw the accident.

00:20:40.822 --> 00:20:43.617
Be grateful Hyang I got there
before the police did.

00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:48.288
The reporters haven't caught on,
so we can keep this quiet.

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:52.501
- Don't mess this up, okay?
- Okay.

00:20:54.044 --> 00:20:55.879
- There you go.
- Okay.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.881
Goodness.

00:20:58.757 --> 00:21:00.050
Can you smell alcohol on me?

00:21:00.968 --> 00:21:03.595
Why do you keep getting into trouble?

00:21:03.679 --> 00:21:04.805
Come here.

00:21:04.888 --> 00:21:06.098
Here. Take this.

00:21:06.598 --> 00:21:07.599
Listen.

00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:09.184
If people find out about this

00:21:09.268 --> 00:21:11.144
you'll be dropped
from Director Cheon's movie.

00:21:11.228 --> 00:21:13.355
And you'll never set foot
in this industry again.

00:21:13.438 --> 00:21:14.982
- Got it?
- I hear you, okay?

00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:38.088
Don't worry about Jung Ho.
He'll be fine.

00:21:38.463 --> 00:21:41.508
How are the executives taking this?
Is Mr. Kang still in Seoul?

00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:44.303
Really? Okay.

00:21:50.809 --> 00:21:51.810
She's stunning.

00:21:53.812 --> 00:21:54.813
Let's have a look.

00:21:54.896 --> 00:21:56.606
- She's beautiful.
- I know.

00:21:57.357 --> 00:21:58.650
Put your phone in the basket.

00:22:00.902 --> 00:22:01.903
I need your phone.

00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:03.822
I can't believe this.

00:22:05.282 --> 00:22:06.825
Don't stare at her like that.

00:22:10.704 --> 00:22:12.414
You're making it so obvious.

00:22:12.497 --> 00:22:14.583
This is the only time
I'll get to see her.

00:22:15.459 --> 00:22:17.377
- Look at how small her face is.
- Have a seat.

00:22:19.379 --> 00:22:20.464
Sit down.

00:22:27.929 --> 00:22:31.767
So you admit it was your poor driving
that caused the accident, correct?

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:32.851
Yes.

00:22:32.934 --> 00:22:36.313
Ms. Kang, what were you doing
at the time of the accident?

00:22:44.321 --> 00:22:45.989
I was passed out drunk.

00:22:49.368 --> 00:22:53.038
Ms. Seok, are you sure
you were the one behind the wheel?

00:22:53.955 --> 00:22:54.956
Yes.

00:22:59.044 --> 00:23:00.712
Could you excuse me for a second?

00:23:13.767 --> 00:23:16.686
Le Na was asleep in the back seat.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.106
I crashed the car on the way back
from picking her up.

00:23:21.483 --> 00:23:22.484
Ms. Seok.

00:23:23.318 --> 00:23:27.948
If it turns out you're lying,
you could face charges.

00:23:28.657 --> 00:23:29.699
I know.

00:23:34.371 --> 00:23:36.665
Detective, you should take this call.

00:23:37.582 --> 00:23:38.792
Hello?

00:23:38.875 --> 00:23:40.127
Chief.

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:41.711
Yes.

00:23:42.587 --> 00:23:44.005
Noted, sir.

00:23:50.762 --> 00:23:52.055
Do you want an autograph?

00:23:57.811 --> 00:23:59.479
- Have a nice day.
- You too.

00:24:00.897 --> 00:24:01.940
Good job.

00:24:02.524 --> 00:24:04.651
Ms. Baek, follow me.

00:24:18.331 --> 00:24:21.209
This is the text message
you sent Baek Seon Gyu.

00:24:21.293 --> 00:24:24.337
"I'll give you the money.
Be at my place by 8 p.m."

00:24:26.798 --> 00:24:29.843
A witness stated that
you sought help from Choi Jung Ho

00:24:29.926 --> 00:24:32.304
saying you were a victim of stalking.

00:24:34.055 --> 00:24:35.182
Goodness.

00:24:35.849 --> 00:24:40.520
On the day of the incident,
you called and texted Choi Jung Ho.

00:24:40.604 --> 00:24:43.648
"Mr. Choi, I need to stop by my place
to grab a few things."

00:24:44.357 --> 00:24:46.276
"What? Right now?"

00:24:49.237 --> 00:24:51.865
So tell me. Why did you lie?

00:24:52.532 --> 00:24:55.702
You said you never saw
a beanie, right?

00:24:56.036 --> 00:24:58.079
Some fibers,
believed to be from a beanie

00:24:58.163 --> 00:25:00.165
were found in your toilet.

00:25:02.417 --> 00:25:03.627
FIBER SAMPLE

00:25:13.303 --> 00:25:15.805
All you've got are your hunches.

00:25:15.889 --> 00:25:16.973
Not really.

00:25:18.016 --> 00:25:19.643
It's called reasonable suspicions.

00:25:26.107 --> 00:25:27.776
Your father, Baek Seon Gyu

00:25:27.859 --> 00:25:30.570
died of a massive hemorrhage
caused by a skull fracture.

00:25:30.654 --> 00:25:34.824
And you claimed Choi Jung Ho hit him.

00:25:38.745 --> 00:25:42.666
But the victim
was hit more than once.

00:25:43.792 --> 00:25:46.545
There are signs of multiple blows
to the head.

00:25:47.045 --> 00:25:51.508
There was a time gap
between the second and third blows.

00:25:52.759 --> 00:25:56.513
Both times, he was struck
with a blunt object.

00:26:02.227 --> 00:26:05.313
You and Choi Jung Ho
were the only two people there.

00:26:05.939 --> 00:26:10.569
And he said he fled the scene
after hitting your father once.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:12.988
Ms. Baek.

00:26:13.071 --> 00:26:15.991
What you've said so far
doesn't add up.

00:26:21.871 --> 00:26:23.456
You still call this a hunch?

00:26:30.922 --> 00:26:32.007
Detective.

00:26:34.926 --> 00:26:37.470
Can I get a glass of water?

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.681
Sure.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.018
Get her a glass of water
and coffee for me.

00:26:43.602 --> 00:26:44.603
Sorry?

00:26:53.111 --> 00:26:56.156
Seriously? She has no respect for me.

00:26:57.324 --> 00:26:58.617
Unbelievable.

00:27:11.004 --> 00:27:13.423
NOJEONG POLICE STATION

00:27:17.552 --> 00:27:19.054
Just like you thought

00:27:19.137 --> 00:27:22.641
Baek Ah Jin is being held
on suspicion of murdering her father.

00:27:22.724 --> 00:27:27.270
They see the abuse from her father
as a clear motive for murder.

00:27:27.979 --> 00:27:31.691
It might be best to hire a lawyer
and push for a lighter sentence.

00:27:31.775 --> 00:27:35.737
It won't mean anything
unless she's cleared of all charges.

00:27:36.112 --> 00:27:38.865
Then, what do you plan to do?

00:27:38.948 --> 00:27:41.201
There's a strong chance
she killed her father.

00:27:42.118 --> 00:27:43.912
Please don't tell Grandpa.

00:27:45.246 --> 00:27:46.289
Please.

00:27:47.374 --> 00:27:48.833
Sure, my lips are sealed.

00:28:07.185 --> 00:28:08.603
All right.

00:28:18.905 --> 00:28:20.615
I'm really sorry...

00:28:20.699 --> 00:28:21.783
What?

00:28:22.117 --> 00:28:23.910
Can you get the female officer?

00:28:27.038 --> 00:28:29.207
I think I just got my period.

00:28:31.584 --> 00:28:33.878
Oh, right.

00:28:33.962 --> 00:28:35.171
Just a second.

00:28:52.105 --> 00:28:53.189
- Hey.
- Yes?

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:54.983
Where is she going?

00:28:55.608 --> 00:28:57.861
Her period just started.

00:28:58.903 --> 00:29:00.405
- Her period?
- Yes.

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:02.991
Detective, wait.

00:29:03.366 --> 00:29:06.077
Have you checked my phone?

00:29:06.494 --> 00:29:07.912
No. Why?

00:29:08.455 --> 00:29:13.626
Can't you check the photos
and the voice recording?

00:29:14.127 --> 00:29:15.670
PROPERTY STORAGE

00:29:15.754 --> 00:29:19.048
Choi Jung Ho hit him with the bat.
He confessed.

00:29:19.132 --> 00:29:22.135
But he's claiming
it was self-defense.

00:29:22.677 --> 00:29:23.762
It was her.

00:29:24.262 --> 00:29:27.098
He beat her constantly.
Of course, she wanted him dead.

00:29:27.182 --> 00:29:29.851
Baek Ah Jin will get off
because of extenuating circumstances

00:29:29.934 --> 00:29:32.103
So we'll draw attention
using Choi Jung Ho.

00:29:32.187 --> 00:29:35.023
That'll give him a way out,
and we can wrap up our case.

00:29:35.398 --> 00:29:37.942
It's a win-win situation, okay?

00:29:57.879 --> 00:30:00.423
I've already told you.
It's not someone on our team.

00:30:01.174 --> 00:30:02.175
Right.

00:30:03.468 --> 00:30:05.220
Okay, got it.

00:30:08.348 --> 00:30:09.349
What was that about?

00:30:09.432 --> 00:30:11.226
That was my friend
from Internal Affairs.

00:30:11.309 --> 00:30:13.144
He keeps probing for something.

00:30:13.812 --> 00:30:15.271
Did someone take another kickback?

00:30:16.231 --> 00:30:17.816
Gosh, are you okay?

00:30:18.733 --> 00:30:19.734
Damn it.

00:30:20.068 --> 00:30:21.444
Here you go.

00:30:21.528 --> 00:30:23.029
Why did you drink that so fast?

00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:27.617
- What is this?
- Not so fast.

00:30:29.077 --> 00:30:30.370
What's the rush?

00:30:31.704 --> 00:30:32.831
Can we check your car?

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.041
Seriously?

00:30:46.636 --> 00:30:48.096
VITAMIN DRINK

00:30:50.265 --> 00:30:53.017
You've been pocketing a lot of things

00:30:53.101 --> 00:30:54.269
so I can't say I'm surprised.

00:30:59.315 --> 00:31:00.859
My mom gave me a box of those.

00:31:00.942 --> 00:31:02.026
Want one?

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:04.320
In my 15 years on the job

00:31:04.404 --> 00:31:07.615
I've never once taken
anything from anyone!

00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:09.534
Give that back.

00:31:10.702 --> 00:31:11.828
It was from his mom.

00:31:13.788 --> 00:31:16.124
He's a disgrace
to government workers everywhere.

00:31:16.207 --> 00:31:18.376
No wonder the country's in a rut.

00:31:18.459 --> 00:31:20.336
A total waste of taxpayers' money.

00:31:34.684 --> 00:31:36.227
VITAMIN DRINK

00:31:38.062 --> 00:31:39.272
That was close.

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:43.151
Who the hell tipped them off?

00:31:51.492 --> 00:31:55.204
You probably thought
this would get me replaced

00:31:55.914 --> 00:31:58.333
and clear you of the charges
once a new detective took over.

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:00.919
Nicely played, I give you that.

00:32:10.553 --> 00:32:12.430
How dare you come after me?

00:32:13.264 --> 00:32:15.016
I'll do everything I can

00:32:16.017 --> 00:32:18.144
to convict you of this murder.

00:32:19.479 --> 00:32:20.813
You got that?

00:32:24.233 --> 00:32:25.234
Here.

00:32:32.867 --> 00:32:34.577
I haven't had a proper meal
in a while.

00:32:34.661 --> 00:32:35.662
Why's that?

00:32:35.745 --> 00:32:39.248
I had to go somewhere,
and I'll be leaving again.

00:32:40.541 --> 00:32:42.251
- Where?
- Somewhere.

00:32:44.837 --> 00:32:47.048
Did you hear the news?

00:32:47.715 --> 00:32:49.926
That jerk Baek Seon Gyu is dead.

00:32:54.222 --> 00:32:55.223
Really?

00:32:57.850 --> 00:32:58.935
That's awful.

00:33:02.063 --> 00:33:03.314
I can't shake the feeling

00:33:04.565 --> 00:33:05.566
- that she...
- Mom.

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:08.403
The rolled omelet is delicious.
Can I get some more?

00:33:13.741 --> 00:33:14.784
What's with you?

00:33:16.536 --> 00:33:19.706
It's not like you to come home
just to have dinner with me.

00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:22.417
You've always gone out of your way
to help Ah Jin.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.919
I just came to see you.
What's wrong with that?

00:33:25.795 --> 00:33:29.215
Besides, she's got nothing
to do with us anymore.

00:33:39.892 --> 00:33:41.310
VISITATION ROOM

00:33:41.394 --> 00:33:43.855
I heard you were backed
into a corner.

00:33:45.189 --> 00:33:47.150
How about I get you a good lawyer?

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:48.860
Maybe you don't need one.

00:33:48.943 --> 00:33:53.156
The charges may be dismissed
before you even need one.

00:33:55.575 --> 00:33:58.369
I know every favor has a price.

00:33:59.328 --> 00:34:02.957
Are you pretending to help me

00:34:04.375 --> 00:34:06.627
so you can profit off me later?

00:34:07.336 --> 00:34:10.631
I heard they're trying to coerce
a confession out of you.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:15.928
They're only doing that
because they can't prove I did it.

00:34:18.806 --> 00:34:20.683
I heard you wanted
to go to law school.

00:34:20.767 --> 00:34:22.518
Seems like you know a thing or two.

00:34:24.479 --> 00:34:25.480
All I'm saying is...

00:34:28.691 --> 00:34:30.610
I'm innocent.

00:34:32.028 --> 00:34:36.032
If they hand you over
to the prosecution

00:34:36.991 --> 00:34:38.785
there's nothing more we can do.

00:34:41.079 --> 00:34:42.830
Why take that risk?

00:34:44.582 --> 00:34:46.334
You'll probably need time to think.

00:34:47.877 --> 00:34:49.921
The boss wakes up before 6 a.m.

00:34:51.672 --> 00:34:53.341
so that should be plenty of time.

00:35:13.903 --> 00:35:15.113
Mr. Choi's right.

00:35:15.613 --> 00:35:19.867
Ah Jin had a stalker recently,
so he was worried about her.

00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:24.914
I think I saw the guy in the beanie
with Ah Jin at the convenience store.

00:35:25.498 --> 00:35:27.125
The guy you saw...

00:35:28.167 --> 00:35:29.168
Was it him?

00:35:30.128 --> 00:35:32.255
According to Jo Yoo Sik

00:35:32.839 --> 00:35:35.508
Baek Ah Jin had a stalker
just like Choi Jung Ho said.

00:35:36.259 --> 00:35:39.971
Turns out it was Yoon Jun Seo,
the one she called the cops on

00:35:40.263 --> 00:35:43.808
who tried to hurt Baek Seon Gyu
two days before the murder.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.101
And?

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:50.314
She reported him to the police
to protect her father.

00:35:50.398 --> 00:35:52.692
So why would she kill her dad
a few days later?

00:35:53.734 --> 00:35:55.444
If she really wanted her father dead

00:35:55.528 --> 00:35:58.239
she could've just let
Yoon Jun Seo do it.

00:35:59.031 --> 00:36:03.369
Why would she protect him then,
only to kill him later?

00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:05.913
Wait, Jo Yoo Sik did say this.

00:36:06.581 --> 00:36:10.960
He saw Baek Ah Jin with the stalker,
but she wasn't scared of him.

00:36:11.043 --> 00:36:13.212
And it didn't look like
he was trying to hurt her.

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:15.131
Weird, right?

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:25.141
Wait, stop the video.
Can you blow this up?

00:36:26.309 --> 00:36:27.435
Play it again.

00:36:32.481 --> 00:36:33.482
Freeze.

00:36:34.233 --> 00:36:36.027
That's not enough
to run facial recognition.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:39.614
Really? Could we get another angle?

00:36:45.369 --> 00:36:47.121
If you see anyone that looks like him

00:36:47.205 --> 00:36:49.790
- give us a call.
- Sure, I'll call you.

00:37:20.279 --> 00:37:21.906
NOJEONG POLICE STATION

00:37:36.545 --> 00:37:40.883
Two days ago, you were arrested
for assaulting Baek Seon Gyu.

00:37:42.843 --> 00:37:44.428
That bastard was evil.

00:37:47.265 --> 00:37:49.225
What's your relationship
to Baek Ah Jin?

00:37:50.726 --> 00:37:54.480
We used to be siblings,
but now we're complete strangers.

00:37:55.022 --> 00:37:57.108
I've been stalking Ah Jin.

00:37:57.191 --> 00:37:58.776
And that Baek Seon Gyu?

00:37:58.859 --> 00:38:00.903
I called the police on him
when I was a kid

00:38:00.987 --> 00:38:02.280
and had him locked up.

00:38:03.072 --> 00:38:05.658
He held a grudge against me
ever since.

00:38:06.367 --> 00:38:09.495
He also used to beat Ah Jin
all the time

00:38:10.413 --> 00:38:11.831
and extorted money from her.

00:38:12.581 --> 00:38:15.626
So what's your point?

00:38:19.463 --> 00:38:22.383
Where did you go
after you got out of lockup that day?

00:38:26.304 --> 00:38:29.807
I went to see Baek Seon Gyu
at the motel where he was staying.

00:38:30.308 --> 00:38:31.976
AFFORDABLE ROOMS

00:38:32.059 --> 00:38:33.769
Why did you go see him?

00:38:33.853 --> 00:38:35.896
SAVE MOTEL

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.356
To get back at him.

00:38:38.733 --> 00:38:39.942
Here you go.

00:38:40.026 --> 00:38:42.236
I fell asleep after drinking this,
and when I woke up

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:45.406
the CCTV had been tampered with
and the receiver was gone.

00:38:45.489 --> 00:38:46.824
Around what time?

00:38:47.116 --> 00:38:48.492
I don't know.

00:38:48.576 --> 00:38:50.578
I don't remember what happened
after that man got here.

00:38:51.704 --> 00:38:52.747
Is this him?

00:38:54.874 --> 00:38:55.958
Yes, it is.

00:38:56.334 --> 00:38:58.127
He asked about the guy in Room 305.

00:38:58.961 --> 00:39:01.839
After drugging him,
I intended to kill him

00:39:03.549 --> 00:39:04.967
once he passed out.

00:39:05.926 --> 00:39:10.514
You see, I meant to put
sleeping pills in his drink.

00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:12.350
HANSOL MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC

00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:16.687
But he wasn't there.

00:39:17.521 --> 00:39:19.940
That's why I went to Ah Jin's house.

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:24.278
What was she doing
when you entered the house?

00:39:25.363 --> 00:39:27.531
She was passed out on the floor.

00:39:28.616 --> 00:39:32.244
- Help me.
- But that devil was still breathing.

00:39:34.163 --> 00:39:36.999
My first thought
was to kill Baek Seon Gyu.

00:39:37.625 --> 00:39:40.586
I wanted to make sure
he wouldn't get in my way again.

00:39:41.212 --> 00:39:44.048
And I wanted to make sure
he never hurt Ah Jin again.

00:39:50.096 --> 00:39:53.974
I hit his head with the baseball bat.

00:39:55.476 --> 00:39:58.687
Are you saying you hit him
with a baseball bat

00:39:58.771 --> 00:40:00.189
while he was down?

00:40:00.272 --> 00:40:01.357
Yes, I hit him.

00:40:08.572 --> 00:40:09.907
So tell me.

00:40:14.328 --> 00:40:16.455
Why did you decide
to turn yourself in now?

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.501
What?

00:40:21.001 --> 00:40:22.002
What do you mean?

00:40:22.962 --> 00:40:24.130
Is that not allowed?

00:40:24.713 --> 00:40:25.965
Well...

00:40:29.552 --> 00:40:30.845
You are allowed to come forward.

00:40:46.444 --> 00:40:47.445
Ms. Baek.

00:40:48.279 --> 00:40:49.655
- Open it up.
- Sure.

00:40:57.121 --> 00:40:58.122
Come with me.

00:41:10.885 --> 00:41:12.011
This way, please.

00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:18.642
You're free to go.

00:41:21.103 --> 00:41:22.104
What?

00:41:24.398 --> 00:41:27.485
You were lucky
your stalker came forward.

00:41:28.652 --> 00:41:29.987
My stalker?

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:31.530
You must not have known.

00:41:32.281 --> 00:41:34.867
Yoon Jun Seo was at your house
the day of the murder.

00:41:36.327 --> 00:41:39.705
While you were passed out,
he broke into your house.

00:41:41.707 --> 00:41:44.793
He attacked your father,
who was still alive then

00:41:44.877 --> 00:41:46.795
and delivered the fatal blow.

00:41:48.964 --> 00:41:50.299
What are you saying?

00:41:50.966 --> 00:41:53.469
Yoon Jun Seo confessed.

00:41:56.764 --> 00:41:58.724
So you're free to go.

00:42:00.976 --> 00:42:04.063

Ah Jin.

You're the one who made me this way.

00:45:06.995 --> 00:45:08.789
It's over now.

00:45:48.996 --> 00:45:49.997

Mr. Baek.

00:46:24.782 --> 00:46:25.824
Mr. Baek?

How far would you go for me?

00:47:17.167 --> 00:47:18.335
Answer me.

00:47:20.671 --> 00:47:22.589
How far would you go for me?

HANSOL MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC

AUTOPSY REPORT

00:50:00.872 --> 00:50:02.290
- Hello?
- Detective.

00:50:02.374 --> 00:50:04.710
- Hello, sir.
- I think I know when

00:50:04.793 --> 00:50:07.254
the guy with the energy drink
came by the motel.

00:50:07.713 --> 00:50:09.464
It was at 1:12 a.m.

00:50:09.548 --> 00:50:12.426
I must've dropped my clock
when I passed out.

00:50:12.509 --> 00:50:14.720
The battery fell out,
so the time had stopped.

00:50:18.807 --> 00:50:19.808
Why did you lie?

00:50:24.021 --> 00:50:26.857
You said you went
to Baek Ah Jin's house

00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:29.359
after realizing Baek Seon Gyu
wasn't at the motel.

00:50:29.776 --> 00:50:32.654
But the timeline doesn't add up.
It's the other way around.

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:36.616
After finding Baek Seon Gyu dead
at Baek Ah Jin's house

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.076
you went to his motel room.

00:50:38.952 --> 00:50:40.871
You made it look like you killed him.

00:50:42.497 --> 00:50:44.791
She's not the girl you stalked.

00:50:45.292 --> 00:50:48.545
You fabricated the evidence
so you'd take the fall

00:50:48.628 --> 00:50:50.422
just so Baek Ah Jin could walk free.

00:50:55.302 --> 00:50:56.428
Is Ah Jin okay?

00:50:57.804 --> 00:51:00.348
- She was released, right?
- Mr. Yoon!

00:51:07.564 --> 00:51:10.776
Ah Jin did nothing wrong.
She's had it rough.

00:51:11.902 --> 00:51:13.904
What are you doing?
Are you kidding me?

00:51:14.654 --> 00:51:16.448
She's had a rough life, okay?

00:51:16.531 --> 00:51:17.532
So please!

00:51:17.991 --> 00:51:19.826
Please don't pin this on her.

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:21.745
I love her, okay?

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:25.916
Her father found out about it,
so I killed him out of rage.

00:51:25.999 --> 00:51:28.710
Why are you taking the fall
for something you didn't do?

00:51:29.711 --> 00:51:31.922
There's proof that Baek Ah Jin
called Choi Jung Ho out

00:51:32.005 --> 00:51:33.882
to have Baek Seon Gyu killed.

00:51:33.965 --> 00:51:36.968
Even if she didn't swing the bat,
it's still a serious crime.

00:51:37.052 --> 00:51:39.971
This isn't something you can cover up
with your lousy lies.

00:51:41.056 --> 00:51:42.057
No.

00:51:42.516 --> 00:51:44.851
Ah Jin wouldn't have done that.
She's just a poor girl.

00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:47.854
Let go of me. Let go!

00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:50.982
I killed him! I killed that bastard!

00:51:51.066 --> 00:51:53.360
Don't you feel bad for Ah Jin?

00:51:55.654 --> 00:51:56.822
- Hold still!
- I killed him.

00:51:56.905 --> 00:51:58.156
I killed him!

00:51:58.907 --> 00:52:00.117
I killed him.

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.493
He's out of his mind.

00:52:01.993 --> 00:52:04.830
We're closing it as a blunt-force
homicide by Choi Jung Ho

00:52:04.913 --> 00:52:06.248
and turning it over
to the prosecution.

00:52:06.331 --> 00:52:08.667
What? What are you talking about?

00:52:09.251 --> 00:52:11.211
We need to question
Baek Ah Jin again.

00:52:11.878 --> 00:52:13.880
NOJEONG POLICE STATION

00:52:20.178 --> 00:52:21.429
I bet you're hungry.

00:52:22.222 --> 00:52:23.223
Hop in.

00:52:25.809 --> 00:52:28.186
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

00:52:33.108 --> 00:52:35.902
The country we live in is a place

00:52:35.986 --> 00:52:39.573
where the people without power
can't clear their names

00:52:40.157 --> 00:52:42.367
or protect what's theirs.

00:52:44.202 --> 00:52:45.912
DEPUTY COMMISSIONER KIM SU IL

00:52:49.332 --> 00:52:52.085
The lead detective
tried to railroad your case.

00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:59.217
It was settled faster
than I expected.

00:53:00.719 --> 00:53:01.761
Now you know.

00:53:02.387 --> 00:53:04.806
This is what it means to have power.

00:53:06.141 --> 00:53:07.350
That power?

00:53:07.976 --> 00:53:09.769
You can have it too.

00:53:10.145 --> 00:53:11.188
I'll help you.

00:53:13.023 --> 00:53:15.525
Yoon Jun Seo will be released
in a few days.

00:53:16.776 --> 00:53:21.156
Please let me know what I can do
to repay you.

00:53:22.824 --> 00:53:23.992
Yoon Jun Seo.

00:53:24.826 --> 00:53:26.620
Stay away from him.

00:53:33.585 --> 00:53:35.962
Why should I stay away from him?

00:53:37.797 --> 00:53:42.510
What's that got to do
with my contract with your agency?

00:53:43.053 --> 00:53:45.555
Ah Jin, you're going to be
incredibly famous.

00:53:46.681 --> 00:53:48.016
I'll make sure of it.

00:53:48.850 --> 00:53:51.937
Your actions, your clothes

00:53:52.687 --> 00:53:54.981
and even the words
you absentmindedly say

00:53:55.774 --> 00:53:58.985
will have tremendous influence

00:53:59.069 --> 00:54:01.279
enough to move
hundreds of billions in capital.

00:54:02.405 --> 00:54:08.828
However, once you become famous,
people will dig up this case again.

00:54:09.704 --> 00:54:11.998
And your relationship
with Yoon Jun Seo

00:54:12.082 --> 00:54:13.625
will come to light.

00:54:13.708 --> 00:54:15.460
Not only will it reveal
your relationship

00:54:15.543 --> 00:54:20.048
but it'll also bring to light
the past you wanted to bury.

00:54:20.632 --> 00:54:21.967
And that's when you'll realize

00:54:22.842 --> 00:54:27.806
that the relationship you had
was toxic to both of you.

00:54:27.889 --> 00:54:31.309
I'm only trying to make sure
that doesn't happen.

00:54:33.478 --> 00:54:36.189
Did that answer your question?

00:54:37.816 --> 00:54:39.442
I was going to cut ties with him

00:54:41.278 --> 00:54:42.821
even if you hadn't told me to.

00:55:12.642 --> 00:55:15.687
NOJEONG-DONG
ROOFTOP HOUSE MURDER 1

00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:26.257
That was too dangerous.

00:56:32.347 --> 00:56:33.890
You could've died.

00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:39.229
I didn't,
and I broke free from my shackles.

00:56:40.647 --> 00:56:41.981
That's all that matters.

00:56:44.526 --> 00:56:46.611
Was that really the only way?

00:56:46.694 --> 00:56:48.530
That's why I told you
to stay out of it.

00:56:48.988 --> 00:56:50.865
This is exactly why
I didn't tell you.

00:56:51.616 --> 00:56:55.370
If I'd told you my plan,
you wouldn't have gone along with it.

00:56:55.453 --> 00:56:57.455
Is that why you used him...

00:56:59.582 --> 00:57:01.000
to kill your father?

00:57:03.086 --> 00:57:07.006
I didn't ask him to,
nor did I force him.

00:57:09.342 --> 00:57:11.761
He came to your house to help you.

00:57:11.845 --> 00:57:14.097
He risked his life to help you.

00:57:14.639 --> 00:57:16.933
He made his own choice.

00:57:17.016 --> 00:57:19.102
You basically forced his hand.

00:57:19.185 --> 00:57:21.271
You set it up
so he'd make that choice.

00:57:23.898 --> 00:57:25.316
Do you feel bad for him?

00:57:27.902 --> 00:57:29.571
Is that why you're yelling at me?

00:57:30.738 --> 00:57:33.992
I'm sorry to say this,
but I only pity myself.

00:57:34.951 --> 00:57:36.369
I only feel sorry for myself.

00:57:37.662 --> 00:57:39.831
I never got to have
a normal life like other people.

00:57:40.582 --> 00:57:43.042
Ever since I was little,
I spent every day wondering

00:57:43.126 --> 00:57:45.462
when I'd get kicked out
or how bad the next beating would be.

00:57:46.337 --> 00:57:52.135
So why should I care about
other people's pain?

00:57:52.594 --> 00:57:55.722
I'm tired of what this world
keeps throwing at me!

00:57:56.431 --> 00:57:57.515
Ah Jin.

00:57:58.183 --> 00:58:00.143
Ah Jin, sit down.

00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:02.770
I promised I'd make up
for my mom's sins

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:05.231
by never leaving your side.

00:58:05.315 --> 00:58:07.233
That was your mother's debt to pay.

00:58:07.317 --> 00:58:10.403
But I want so much more than that.

00:58:11.279 --> 00:58:12.614
Please don't be like this.

00:58:14.491 --> 00:58:15.492
Ah Jin, please.

00:58:16.075 --> 00:58:18.703
I'll make you happy,
just like everyone else is.

00:58:20.079 --> 00:58:21.331
Ah Jin, please don't do this.

00:58:22.207 --> 00:58:23.208
Ah Jin.

00:58:23.583 --> 00:58:24.584
Jun Seo.

00:58:26.628 --> 00:58:27.795
Don't kid yourself.

00:58:32.467 --> 00:58:35.011
You've never once protected me.

00:58:36.513 --> 00:58:38.723
If you had been serious
about protecting me

00:58:39.057 --> 00:58:40.808
you would have killed him

00:58:41.059 --> 00:58:43.311
before I took matters
into my own hands.

00:58:44.604 --> 00:58:45.605
Go tell him.

00:58:46.606 --> 00:58:48.358
Tell Choi Jung Ho the truth.

00:58:50.568 --> 00:58:53.821
I can't wait to see his face
when he finds out he was used.

00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:56.366
You...

00:58:59.410 --> 00:59:00.870
You're going to pay for this.

00:59:03.081 --> 00:59:04.999
What you did was unforgivable.

00:59:06.459 --> 00:59:10.088
I won't get what I want
if I live the way you do.

00:59:12.632 --> 00:59:13.758
Don't get in my way

00:59:15.468 --> 00:59:16.928
and don't ruin my life.

00:59:20.848 --> 00:59:22.850
For all the pain you've caused

00:59:22.934 --> 00:59:24.435
you'll be miserable
for the rest of your life.

00:59:25.019 --> 00:59:27.438
Every day of your life
will be empty and exhausting.

00:59:27.522 --> 00:59:30.900
You might be miserable
for the rest of your life.

00:59:31.526 --> 00:59:32.610
Because I...

00:59:34.821 --> 00:59:35.905
Because I know that...

00:59:42.495 --> 00:59:43.580
I can't leave you.

00:59:46.916 --> 00:59:50.587
I have to share your punishment
when that day comes.

00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:56.426
You may be right.

00:59:58.803 --> 01:00:00.263
But you don't know how I feel...

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:04.559
because you haven't walked
in my shoes.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:08.896
You're not me...

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:13.526
so you'll never understand.

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:29.584
Your kindness

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:32.795
will put me in danger.

01:00:33.713 --> 01:00:34.839
You're too kind.

01:00:35.673 --> 01:00:38.176
And to me, that's a shackle,
just like my father.

01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:40.511
You keep dragging me down.

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:42.680
What are you getting at?

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.308
I'm saying this is goodbye.

01:00:48.728 --> 01:00:49.729
Ah Jin.

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:52.940
I'll climb to the top, where no one
will dare stand in my way.

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:58.363
I want to be reborn at the very top.

01:01:00.573 --> 01:01:04.160
Where you're headed
could be the loneliest...

01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:08.998
most miserable place there is.

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:12.418
I don't care.

01:01:15.004 --> 01:01:18.424
It's not like I even know
what happiness is.

01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:26.516
If she ever finds happiness...

01:01:29.018 --> 01:01:31.729
it'll come at the cost
of someone else's pain.

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:36.859
That illusion of happiness

01:01:38.486 --> 01:01:40.196
will never last.

01:01:41.614 --> 01:01:42.907
I'm certain of it.

01:01:46.786 --> 01:01:48.746
If there is a god,
I'd like to ask him this.

01:01:49.664 --> 01:01:50.707
"Why is it

01:01:51.749 --> 01:01:53.167
that I love...

01:01:55.211 --> 01:01:56.462
someone so cruel?"

01:02:29.287 --> 01:02:31.080
Baek Ah Jin,
the rising star, turns heads

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:32.623
in the film
and entertainment industry.

01:02:32.707 --> 01:02:35.001
Baek Ah Jin, the new face
of global fashion brand Hadere...

01:02:35.084 --> 01:02:37.378
The up-and-coming icon...

01:02:37.462 --> 01:02:39.630
Actress Baek Ah Jin tops
brand image rankings.

01:02:39.714 --> 01:02:41.799
Baek Ah Jin's name has become
a cultural phenomenon.

01:02:41.883 --> 01:02:44.469
A cultural powerhouse
shaping an entire generation's

01:02:44.552 --> 01:02:47.221
- vibe and taste...
- At the Berlin Film Festival...

01:02:47.305 --> 01:02:49.348
She is gaining global attention
through her acting.

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:52.560
She's been turning heads
even in the global market.

01:02:52.643 --> 01:02:54.771
- Winning Best Actress...
- Tonight

01:02:54.854 --> 01:02:57.774
her name outshines
every trophy out there.

01:02:57.857 --> 01:03:00.860
How much more of a global sensation
will she become?

01:03:00.943 --> 01:03:03.112
I spent every night awake

01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:05.698
and every day
drowning in my own tears.

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:08.826
I tried to let it all go

01:03:10.328 --> 01:03:11.621
to forgive and move on.

01:03:12.538 --> 01:03:14.248
However, you chose to be silent.

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:17.335
Yet he lived on.

01:03:18.753 --> 01:03:19.754
And I...

01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:23.800
I alone escaped your judgment

01:03:26.594 --> 01:03:29.639
leaving me to suffer
in this agonizing Hell.

01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:43.653
DEAR X

01:06:03.751 --> 01:06:05.753
