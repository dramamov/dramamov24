00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.761
Mr. Jin, Hui-su's gone.

00:01:14.304 --> 00:01:15.180
What do you mean?

00:01:15.263 --> 00:01:16.931
What if Jang Kang took her?

00:01:17.432 --> 00:01:19.726
What if Noh Jin-young
did something bad to her?

00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:23.354
Hey, Eun-su. Pull yourself together, okay?
That would never happen.

00:01:24.856 --> 00:01:26.816
-Find him at all costs.
-Yes, sir.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.075
Someone called
Hui-su's mom's nursing home,

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.244
posing as her niece,
and asked for her address.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:39.746
It's Noh Jin-young.

00:01:40.955 --> 00:01:42.457
-Eun-su.
-Yes?

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.083
Hold on tight.

00:02:02.477 --> 00:02:04.270
MOM
I'M SORRY TO LEAVE YOU ALL ALONE

00:02:04.354 --> 00:02:06.731
I COMMITTED AN UNFORGIVABLE SIN
I KILLED JIN-PYO

EUN-SU

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.409
Let's be real. Nobody takes the stairs,
not even for a single floor.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.163
And who'd lug all their stuff up
from the parking lot by the stairs?

00:02:22.247 --> 00:02:26.000
No wonder they didn't bother fixing
the cameras in the parking lot stairwell.

00:02:27.627 --> 00:02:29.796
Which only makes our job harder.

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.300
I mean, I get it. In these complexes,
every expense needs resident approval.

00:02:35.385 --> 00:02:37.804
Something bad needs to happen.

00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:39.722
That came out wrong.

00:02:41.307 --> 00:02:45.728
The way I see it, the bastard
has a knack for avoiding security cameras.

00:02:46.562 --> 00:02:47.605
Or a bitch.

00:02:48.773 --> 00:02:49.607
Sorry?

00:02:51.276 --> 00:02:54.362
She was misleading me on purpose?

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.494
Gyeong-gu.

00:03:02.036 --> 00:03:02.870

GANGNAM POLICE STATION

00:03:51.544 --> 00:03:52.837
Do you know what time it is?

00:03:53.421 --> 00:03:55.590
Right, I apologize for calling so late.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.134
I'm calling about
the security footage you saw

00:03:58.217 --> 00:04:01.471
concerning the guard's murder
at your brother's apartment complex.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.139
Go on.

00:04:04.057 --> 00:04:07.143
Some parts were damaged,
so we tried to restore them.

00:04:08.728 --> 00:04:09.562
And?

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:14.734
Your brother actually appeared
in the restored portion.

00:04:22.158 --> 00:04:22.992
My brother?

00:04:24.994 --> 00:04:26.079
That's impossible.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.915
If I may ask,

00:04:29.415 --> 00:04:32.085
did you happen to see the part
with your brother in it?

00:04:34.212 --> 00:04:36.589
You make it sound like I deleted it.

00:04:41.344 --> 00:04:45.181
He's your family. It's perfectly natural
that you might've been caught off guard.

00:04:45.264 --> 00:04:46.891
Why would I be caught off guard?

00:04:47.392 --> 00:04:50.770
I never saw him on the footage,
and it couldn't have been him anyway.

00:04:52.688 --> 00:04:55.942
I've secured testimony that places
Mr. Noh Jin-pyo there on that day.

00:04:59.987 --> 00:05:01.197
Who, my sister-in-law?

00:05:01.906 --> 00:05:03.491
We're still mid-investigation, so--

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:04.867
Jin-pyo's travel records.

00:05:06.035 --> 00:05:07.161
Have you checked them?

00:05:11.207 --> 00:05:13.418
He wasn't in the country at the time.

00:05:15.378 --> 00:05:16.921
I told you, didn't I?

00:05:17.463 --> 00:05:19.298
My sister-in-law's a bit of a character.

00:05:20.133 --> 00:05:21.843
Last time, she faked abuse--

00:05:21.926 --> 00:05:25.972
I've confirmed that the medical report
and photos were genuine evidence of abuse.

00:05:28.224 --> 00:05:29.058
What?

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:32.353
What do you mean?

00:05:32.437 --> 00:05:34.647
Look, I'm out right now, so--

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.315
You didn't meet Hui-su, did you?

00:05:37.108 --> 00:05:38.276
I'll call you later.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.946
Look into it.

00:05:47.243 --> 00:05:48.077
Shit.

00:05:53.833 --> 00:05:55.084
MOM

00:05:57.128 --> 00:05:57.962
Hello?

00:05:58.045 --> 00:06:01.090
What's all this at the crack of dawn?
The police are out front.

00:06:01.174 --> 00:06:03.468
They're ringing the bell,
asking for Jin-pyo.

00:06:03.968 --> 00:06:05.344
Don't let them in.

00:06:06.345 --> 00:06:08.598
Ask for their name and where they're from.

00:06:08.681 --> 00:06:11.309
Just ask them who they are
and what station they're from.

00:06:13.352 --> 00:06:16.189
He says he's Detective Choi Gyeong-gu
from the Gangnam station.

00:06:16.272 --> 00:06:18.816
Don't let him in! No matter what.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.568
He's insisting it won't take long.

00:06:20.651 --> 00:06:22.195
Just don't talk to him!

00:06:22.278 --> 00:06:25.156
Don't respond to the doorbell
or pick up the phone.

00:06:25.656 --> 00:06:28.284
As soon as they leave,
head straight to my place.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.244
Why your place?

00:06:30.828 --> 00:06:33.080
Too many people know your place already.

00:06:33.581 --> 00:06:36.334
Please, just do as I say and go.

00:06:36.417 --> 00:06:38.002
I'll head over there now too.

00:06:38.085 --> 00:06:39.086
Jin-young!

00:06:52.308 --> 00:06:53.142
Gyeong-gu.

00:06:53.851 --> 00:06:57.021
-How did it go?
-Mr. Noh was abroad at that time.

00:06:57.522 --> 00:06:58.356
What?

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:00.733
He left six weeks ago
and hasn't been back since.

00:07:05.988 --> 00:07:08.533

DETECTIVE CHOI HERE
FROM GANGNAM STATION

00:07:26.842 --> 00:07:29.345
You must be swamped,
yet you still came to say hi?

00:07:29.845 --> 00:07:31.264
You sure are one of a kind.

00:07:31.764 --> 00:07:34.517
They say a real connection
is one that can pull strings.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.438
So would you do me the honor
of being my connection from now on?

00:07:40.481 --> 00:07:42.191
Please, you flatter me.

00:07:42.817 --> 00:07:46.112
But I'll be sure to personally
pass on your regards to Chief Im.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.158
By the way,

00:07:51.242 --> 00:07:53.828
do you know about
the recent security guard murder

00:07:53.911 --> 00:07:56.455
at the Breeze Hill apartments
in your jurisdiction?

00:07:56.539 --> 00:07:57.373
Of course.

00:07:58.499 --> 00:07:59.792
It's Chief Im.

00:08:01.043 --> 00:08:01.877
Yes?

00:08:03.296 --> 00:08:06.132
Her mother lives alone
in that apartment complex,

00:08:06.799 --> 00:08:09.010
so she seemed quite concerned.

00:08:09.802 --> 00:08:12.722
She said the young detective in charge
has been poking around,

00:08:12.805 --> 00:08:14.807
making the residents very uneasy.

00:08:15.766 --> 00:08:16.601
Is that so?

00:08:16.684 --> 00:08:19.937
It seemed like she wanted him
pulled from the investigation.

00:08:26.444 --> 00:08:29.071
Jin-young. Congratulations.

00:08:29.155 --> 00:08:30.865
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

00:08:30.948 --> 00:08:32.325
Congratulations, ma'am.

00:08:35.036 --> 00:08:38.080
Congratulations on your promotion

00:08:38.164 --> 00:08:41.292
Congratulations on your promotion

00:08:41.375 --> 00:08:45.379
Congratulations, dear Jin-young

00:08:45.463 --> 00:08:48.132
Congratulations on your promotion

00:09:20.623 --> 00:09:21.457
No.

00:09:37.014 --> 00:09:38.224
Hui-su is alive.

00:09:57.743 --> 00:09:59.120
That was Noh Jin-young.

00:10:07.461 --> 00:10:08.379
Hui-su!

00:10:09.046 --> 00:10:09.964
Hui-su!

00:10:12.925 --> 00:10:13.759
Hui-su!

00:10:14.593 --> 00:10:17.179
Hui-su! Wake up, Hui-su!

00:10:17.263 --> 00:10:18.222
-Eun-su.
-Hui-su!

00:10:18.973 --> 00:10:20.933
-Hui-su!
-Easy. Let's get to a hospital.

00:10:21.016 --> 00:10:22.226
Hui-su.

00:10:24.228 --> 00:10:25.146
This can't be.

00:10:34.613 --> 00:10:36.365
Excuse me, ma'am. Hey, wait!

00:10:36.866 --> 00:10:38.075
EMERGENCY ROOM

00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:40.619
Ms. Jo Hui-su
was just transferred to Seoul.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.038
Which hospital in Seoul? Where exactly?

00:10:43.122 --> 00:10:45.249
I'm afraid I can't disclose
that information.

00:10:50.087 --> 00:10:51.922
It's for an urgent investigation.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:53.716
One moment, please.

00:10:59.513 --> 00:11:00.806
HUI-SU

00:11:02.725 --> 00:11:04.769
Your call cannot be completed as dialed--

00:11:12.526 --> 00:11:13.569
Where are you?

00:11:17.114 --> 00:11:18.407
Where's Jo Hui-su?

00:11:25.247 --> 00:11:26.957
Why did you do that to her?

00:11:28.584 --> 00:11:30.002
You have some nerve to ask me that.

00:11:30.085 --> 00:11:31.921
You know what Jin-pyo did.

00:11:32.421 --> 00:11:35.925
If you hadn't turned a blind eye,
then he wouldn't have died.

00:11:37.468 --> 00:11:39.845
Well, aren't you a fucking bitch?

00:11:40.471 --> 00:11:42.431
You killed him, and now what?

00:11:42.932 --> 00:11:45.142
Why don't you try taking it to the cops?

00:11:45.226 --> 00:11:47.895
Nothing he did
would even count as a crime.

00:11:48.979 --> 00:11:49.939
It's not a crime?

00:11:50.022 --> 00:11:51.607
What, and you bitches are innocent?

00:11:53.984 --> 00:11:56.070
It's a good thing
Jo Hui-su didn't die today.

00:11:57.112 --> 00:11:59.198
I almost let you live.

00:12:00.825 --> 00:12:01.951
Did you tell her

00:12:03.244 --> 00:12:05.788
to kill herself
in exchange for sparing my life?

00:12:07.957 --> 00:12:09.375
Well, fuck this.

00:12:10.793 --> 00:12:12.545
How could I be so naive?

00:12:14.755 --> 00:12:17.842
I should have made both you bitches
kill yourselves from the start.

00:12:19.927 --> 00:12:21.804
Try something like that on Hui-su again.

00:12:21.887 --> 00:12:24.932
This fucking bitch will destroy
your precious little career.

00:12:25.015 --> 00:12:26.725
Back off while you still can.

00:12:31.897 --> 00:12:35.568
Listen. If I backed off
every time I was supposed to,

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:38.571
I wouldn't have made it this far.

00:12:40.281 --> 00:12:41.991
If this is how you two want to play,

00:12:43.617 --> 00:12:45.452
I can't back off either, can I?

It appears you gave
a false statement yesterday.

00:14:23.133 --> 00:14:24.468

Hope you're ready.

00:14:37.022 --> 00:14:38.607
Please wake up!

00:14:38.691 --> 00:14:40.025
Eun-su, get the door.

00:14:58.043 --> 00:15:00.754
Hey, are you all right?

00:15:03.924 --> 00:15:04.758
Eun-su.

00:15:06.885 --> 00:15:08.721
I know you can't eat right now,

00:15:09.304 --> 00:15:11.015
but you can at least feast your eyes.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.518
Just seeing spicy food
makes your mouth water, perks you up,

00:15:14.601 --> 00:15:16.186
and gives you the will to live.

00:15:21.608 --> 00:15:22.609
So you met Jin-young?

00:15:29.283 --> 00:15:30.284
Eun-su.

00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:35.748
This past month and a half,

00:15:37.041 --> 00:15:38.959
I actually felt truly alive.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.803
I've never felt so relaxed, calm,

00:15:50.637 --> 00:15:51.722
and at peace.

00:15:55.184 --> 00:15:56.852
That's been more than enough.

00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:09.114
Over the past month and a half…

00:16:11.992 --> 00:16:14.870
I've also felt like I've emerged
from a long, dark tunnel.

00:16:27.966 --> 00:16:30.344
I can't wait any longer. I'm digging in.

00:16:48.362 --> 00:16:49.238
Ms. Jo.

00:16:49.947 --> 00:16:50.781
Hey.

00:16:50.864 --> 00:16:52.241
Don't you have the day off?

00:16:53.408 --> 00:16:55.744
I do, but I had a feeling
someone might come for me.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.623
Keep up the good work.

00:17:01.166 --> 00:17:02.668
You must be Ms. Jo Eun-su.

00:17:04.711 --> 00:17:05.546
Yes.

00:17:06.296 --> 00:17:09.383
We need to question you
about suspected bribes from suppliers.

00:17:10.134 --> 00:17:11.760
Please come with us to the station.

00:17:26.733 --> 00:17:28.318
JO EUN-SU

00:17:44.793 --> 00:17:46.712
RECORDING

00:17:56.847 --> 00:17:58.557
STANDBY

00:18:08.317 --> 00:18:10.068
Any thoughts, now that you're here?

00:18:16.575 --> 00:18:19.077
Did you manage to hide Jang Kang well?

00:18:21.455 --> 00:18:23.749
After thinking about it,
I figured it had to be you.

00:18:25.292 --> 00:18:27.127
Is he still alive and well?

00:18:29.087 --> 00:18:31.423
I'll deal with him, don't you worry.

00:18:35.302 --> 00:18:37.346
Time to wrap up our chat from earlier.

00:18:41.558 --> 00:18:44.186
I hear your father's retirement
is coming up.

00:18:47.272 --> 00:18:49.399
He may have served
as a low-level civil servant,

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.735
but he still deserves to retire

00:18:53.111 --> 00:18:55.739
with a plaque
engraved with his name. Jo Jeong-nam.

00:18:58.325 --> 00:18:59.618
Don't you think?

00:19:05.916 --> 00:19:08.252
How quickly do you reckon
your mother will get here?

00:19:12.256 --> 00:19:13.632
Hand Jo Hui-su over.

00:19:29.731 --> 00:19:30.607
Yes, ma'am.

00:19:30.691 --> 00:19:35.320
Is it true you helped your brother,
a white-collar criminal, skip the country?

00:19:36.363 --> 00:19:38.991
-Sorry?
-And you made his firm cover it up?

00:19:42.703 --> 00:19:43.704
No, ma'am.

00:19:44.705 --> 00:19:46.039
I did no such thing.

00:19:46.123 --> 00:19:48.333
I want a crystal-clear explanation.

00:19:48.417 --> 00:19:49.584
I'll give you one hour.

00:19:49.668 --> 00:19:50.502
Ma'am.

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:56.550
Fuck.

00:20:15.819 --> 00:20:17.696
I haven't mentioned
the domestic violence yet

00:20:18.196 --> 00:20:19.823
or everything that came after.

00:20:23.535 --> 00:20:25.579
You fucking bitch.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:28.040
Ms. Jo's attorney is here.

00:20:28.123 --> 00:20:30.334
What are you doing?
This is a witness statement!

00:20:35.589 --> 00:20:36.673
Fuck.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.226
Please wait here for a moment.

00:20:56.443 --> 00:20:58.278
I'm here at the request of Mr. Jin.

00:21:29.017 --> 00:21:30.352
MOM

00:21:31.144 --> 00:21:34.106
-I'm driving. I'll call you--
-Jin-young, that man!

00:21:34.689 --> 00:21:36.441
I can't hear you. I'll call you back.

00:21:36.525 --> 00:21:37.359
Jin-young!

00:21:38.443 --> 00:21:39.986
That man is…

00:22:04.845 --> 00:22:06.263
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

00:22:06.763 --> 00:22:09.599
Go get both your and Hui-su's
passports and suitcases.

00:22:10.851 --> 00:22:13.520
Let's get you on a flight,
and I'll sort out the rest.

00:22:14.062 --> 00:22:15.772
-Mr. Jin.
-Not another word.

00:23:06.823 --> 00:23:07.657
Yes?

00:23:11.661 --> 00:23:14.247
Jang Kang might be there,
so keep a close watch.

00:23:27.636 --> 00:23:28.637
Please.

00:23:42.108 --> 00:23:43.068
Fuck.

00:24:06.299 --> 00:24:09.052
A FEW HOURS AGO

00:24:45.338 --> 00:24:46.339
Jin-pyo?

00:24:51.011 --> 00:24:52.429
Jin-pyo!

00:24:52.929 --> 00:24:56.099
Why are you lying here like this?
Get up, Jin-pyo.

00:24:56.891 --> 00:24:57.726
Wake up.

00:24:57.809 --> 00:24:59.352
Jin-pyo, please!

00:24:59.978 --> 00:25:01.730
Goodness, what on earth…

00:25:01.813 --> 00:25:02.689
Mom.

00:25:04.274 --> 00:25:05.692
Please uncuff me.

00:25:14.075 --> 00:25:14.993
Who are you?

00:25:15.076 --> 00:25:16.703
It's me, Noh Jin-pyo.

00:25:17.454 --> 00:25:20.081
Your son, Mom.

00:25:20.582 --> 00:25:21.875
Mom, I'm hurting.

00:25:22.375 --> 00:25:23.793
Please uncuff me.

00:25:23.877 --> 00:25:26.838
That watch. It's Jin-pyo's.

00:25:27.839 --> 00:25:30.383
Give it back.
Why the hell are you wearing it?

00:25:30.467 --> 00:25:32.927
You think this fucking watch
is what matters right now?

00:25:33.011 --> 00:25:34.262
For fuck's sake!

00:25:35.263 --> 00:25:37.057
Like mother, like daughter.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.559
Sure cut from the same cloth, aren't you?

00:25:41.102 --> 00:25:43.980
You don't even care
that Noh Jin-pyo's dead, do you?

00:25:47.525 --> 00:25:48.360
What?

00:25:49.694 --> 00:25:52.656
What did you just say?

00:25:55.408 --> 00:25:58.370
I said he's checked out, lady.

00:26:00.205 --> 00:26:01.998
Has been for a good while now.

00:26:03.083 --> 00:26:03.917
No.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.961
Go ask your fucking daughter
if it's true or not,

00:26:07.045 --> 00:26:10.507
and just get me
the fuck out of here right now!

00:26:11.716 --> 00:26:14.969
You. What did you do to my son?
What did you do to him?

00:26:16.971 --> 00:26:20.642
Well, you should've done a better job
of raising your damn kid.

00:26:23.728 --> 00:26:27.399
If only your son hadn't grown up
to be such a piece of shit…

00:26:28.525 --> 00:26:29.859
For fuck's sake.

00:26:29.943 --> 00:26:33.405
I wouldn't be here
looking like shit right now.

00:26:33.905 --> 00:26:38.743
Noh Jin-pyo, that bastard,
deserved to die.

00:27:09.774 --> 00:27:10.650
This bastard.

00:27:10.734 --> 00:27:13.486
He killed my Jin-pyo, didn't he?

00:27:13.987 --> 00:27:15.530
He killed Jin-pyo, didn't he?

00:27:16.781 --> 00:27:19.117
Do you want to drag us both down
with Jin-pyo?

00:27:19.993 --> 00:27:23.163
Could you manage if I don't make it
to the president's office?

00:27:23.246 --> 00:27:25.582
Do you seriously
want to get locked up for murder?

00:27:25.665 --> 00:27:27.584
Please just get a grip!

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:30.545
Pull yourself together, please.

00:27:40.013 --> 00:27:42.891
Hold on. Okay, now come. We're fine.

00:27:42.974 --> 00:27:44.350
Now lift.

00:28:08.124 --> 00:28:08.958
Yes, what's up?

00:28:09.042 --> 00:28:11.419
Noh Jin-young loaded something
in her trunk and left.

00:28:11.503 --> 00:28:12.879
I think it's Jang Kang.

00:28:13.463 --> 00:28:14.672
I think he's dead, sir.

00:28:15.173 --> 00:28:16.007
What?

00:28:18.718 --> 00:28:20.345
Ko Jeong-suk is with her.

00:28:20.428 --> 00:28:22.555
Looks like they're going to dump his body.

00:28:28.186 --> 00:28:31.898
Okay. I'm on my way now,
so keep a close watch…

00:28:32.398 --> 00:28:33.650
Hey, don't hang up yet.

00:28:33.733 --> 00:28:34.651
I'll go.

00:28:34.734 --> 00:28:36.736
No, you'll take Hui-su, and--

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:37.904
Please let me go.

00:28:40.448 --> 00:28:41.449
No.

00:28:42.992 --> 00:28:45.662
I started this,
so it's only right that I finish it.

00:28:45.745 --> 00:28:47.330
Eun-su, it'll all be over soon.

00:28:47.413 --> 00:28:50.416
You just have to leave with Hui-su.
Why would you do this?

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.710
-Mr. Jin.
-Yes, Eun-su. What?

00:29:20.738 --> 00:29:21.573
Hey, Ma.

00:29:23.283 --> 00:29:24.784
Are you sure Jang Kang is dead?

00:29:27.954 --> 00:29:29.289
Okay, hang up.

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:35.336
Please take care of Hui-su.

00:29:36.629 --> 00:29:37.630
Jo Eun-su.

00:29:46.681 --> 00:29:48.641
Take this with you, just in case.

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:56.524
Okay.

00:30:21.591 --> 00:30:23.718
You have gone off route.

00:30:26.012 --> 00:30:28.681
Eun-su's going in my place,
so keep your eyes glued to her.

00:30:30.516 --> 00:30:32.602
You have gone off course.

00:30:41.778 --> 00:30:43.613
Mr. Jin, where's Eun-su?

00:30:50.161 --> 00:30:51.412
Where did she go?

00:30:55.458 --> 00:30:56.292
What?

00:31:39.043 --> 00:31:41.045
I'm almost there. I see them.

00:31:57.854 --> 00:31:58.730
Damn it.

00:32:20.793 --> 00:32:21.794
Shit.

00:32:26.382 --> 00:32:28.593
Time to unleash that inner psycho.

00:32:37.477 --> 00:32:39.270
I killed my husband.

00:32:44.525 --> 00:32:45.485
A car accident!

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:50.031
What the heck? What just happened?

00:32:53.201 --> 00:32:54.452
That car hit it full-on!

00:32:55.661 --> 00:32:56.746
Is that a body?

00:32:57.413 --> 00:32:59.332
I think that's an actual body!

00:33:01.334 --> 00:33:02.877
What the heck? It's a body!

00:33:08.341 --> 00:33:09.509
Fuck!

00:33:11.344 --> 00:33:13.054
-Get it!
-Get closer!

00:33:14.931 --> 00:33:16.766
Hey, wait. I know her.

00:33:16.849 --> 00:33:19.185
-Isn't that Ko Jeong-suk?
-What? No way.

00:33:21.354 --> 00:33:22.814
Ms. Eun-su, are you okay?

00:33:22.897 --> 00:33:23.731
Yes.

00:33:31.739 --> 00:33:32.573
What is that?

00:33:33.282 --> 00:33:35.284
-This is unbelievable!
-That person…

00:33:38.121 --> 00:33:39.622
Should I get a photo too?

00:33:56.013 --> 00:33:57.974
On the night of October 30th,

00:33:59.392 --> 00:34:01.435
I killed my husband,

00:34:02.436 --> 00:34:03.521
Noh Jin-pyo.

00:34:08.526 --> 00:34:09.527
And yesterday…

00:34:11.529 --> 00:34:13.322
Noh Jin-young tried to kill me.

00:34:24.584 --> 00:34:26.878
MA HAE-RYONG

00:34:28.921 --> 00:34:29.755
Hey.

00:34:43.394 --> 00:34:48.691
Around 7:00 p.m. tonight in Jamsil, Seoul,
a three-car collision took a shocking turn

00:34:48.774 --> 00:34:53.487
when a male body was found
in one of the vehicles' trunks.

00:34:53.988 --> 00:34:57.450
At the scene, police placed
the three drivers and one passenger

00:34:57.533 --> 00:34:59.160
under arrest.

00:34:59.744 --> 00:35:03.623
Police identified the driver of the car
with the body as active-duty officer Noh.

00:35:03.706 --> 00:35:04.582
DELETE PERMANENTLY?
YES

00:35:04.665 --> 00:35:06.000
Noh's mother, a lecturer…

00:35:07.376 --> 00:35:10.588
Everything was caught on the dashcam,
so there's no denying this.

00:35:10.671 --> 00:35:13.216
-I just don't get why.
-Don't you have work to do?

00:35:15.301 --> 00:35:16.802
Get to work. Go on.

00:35:19.305 --> 00:35:23.643
If you're feeling overwhelmed,
we can stop for today and resume tomorrow.

00:35:24.435 --> 00:35:25.937
No, I'm good to continue.

00:35:29.523 --> 00:35:31.525
You're just like Ms. Jo Hui-su.

00:35:35.279 --> 00:35:37.698
Is she doing okay?

00:35:39.408 --> 00:35:40.284
Yes.

00:35:44.247 --> 00:35:46.958
That's all I needed to hear.
Let's keep going.

00:35:55.967 --> 00:35:58.094
If you're worried about
Ms. Jo's condition…

00:36:00.096 --> 00:36:01.889
you don't need to worry.

00:36:09.063 --> 00:36:10.231
Thank you, sir.

00:36:55.568 --> 00:36:58.070
We will present the best possible defense.

00:37:04.327 --> 00:37:06.120
LAW FIRM BAEKSAN

00:37:06.203 --> 00:37:08.873
Of course you will,
with what I'm paying you.

00:37:13.711 --> 00:37:18.215
With another murder and attempted murder
coming to light during the investigation,

00:37:18.299 --> 00:37:21.385
the police now suspect
this was not a simple traffic accident,

00:37:21.469 --> 00:37:24.597
but an incident
connected to a far more serious crime.

00:37:25.097 --> 00:37:29.226
Newly surfaced footage has shocked many,
showing Noh, an active duty officer,

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:33.981
attempting to murder her sister-in-law Jo
by staging her death as a suicide.

00:37:34.065 --> 00:37:37.902
Meanwhile, Noh stayed silent
en route to the station,

00:37:37.985 --> 00:37:41.906
ignoring journalists' questions
about her actions that shamed the force.

00:37:50.915 --> 00:37:51.749
DV BYSTANDER

00:38:02.802 --> 00:38:04.804
YOU ARE NO WOMEN'S ADVOCATE!
KO JEONG-SUK OUT

00:38:05.888 --> 00:38:06.931
Hey, you!

00:38:07.014 --> 00:38:11.310
Your selfish love for your child
is what got him killed!

00:38:11.394 --> 00:38:12.561
You got that?

00:38:15.147 --> 00:38:17.983
You… I'll sue you for defamation!

00:38:18.484 --> 00:38:20.027
My son is the one who died.

00:38:20.528 --> 00:38:23.114
I'm the victim here.
Why are you bitching at us?

00:38:25.825 --> 00:38:27.910
Ko asserted to the protestors at the scene

00:38:27.993 --> 00:38:31.956
that she was, in fact, the real victim,
sparking even greater public outrage.

00:38:37.586 --> 00:38:38.421
Hello?

00:38:38.963 --> 00:38:39.880
Hello, Ms. Kim.

00:38:40.798 --> 00:38:43.300
I'd like to sincerely apologize

00:38:44.009 --> 00:38:48.472
for the concern caused by an incident
involving one of our employees.

00:38:49.348 --> 00:38:51.475
I didn't really suffer any harm.

00:38:53.686 --> 00:38:56.313
Was Ms. Jo badly hurt?

00:38:57.982 --> 00:39:00.693
TO MASTER KIM DAE-CHEOL

00:39:41.066 --> 00:39:42.610
SUPREME COURT

00:40:06.091 --> 00:40:07.760
Please make your final statement.

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:25.319
While living with my husband, I…

00:40:28.656 --> 00:40:30.699
hoped to die every single day.

00:40:33.494 --> 00:40:35.829
I cried out to the heavens,
but no one answered.

00:40:37.998 --> 00:40:39.542
And my husband's abuse

00:40:40.751 --> 00:40:42.670
was always right there in front of me.

00:40:45.673 --> 00:40:46.840
Then I realized…

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.220
if I don't break the cycle…

00:40:53.973 --> 00:40:55.516
it will never end.

00:41:07.069 --> 00:41:08.445
In the end, I…

00:41:10.281 --> 00:41:12.032
killed my husband.

00:41:16.203 --> 00:41:19.665
I acknowledge
that everything started with me,

00:41:20.749 --> 00:41:25.087
and I know there is nothing I could say
to justify what I have done.

00:41:27.464 --> 00:41:28.966
So I am prepared…

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:33.345
to fully atone for the crimes
I have committed.

00:41:36.098 --> 00:41:39.893
Defendant Jo Eun-su,
please make your final statement.

00:41:46.984 --> 00:41:49.778
As a child, whenever I heard
my mom getting beaten,

00:41:51.238 --> 00:41:55.701
I would grab my little brother's hand
and hide in the closet.

00:41:57.411 --> 00:41:59.371
Then, once it grew quiet outside,

00:42:00.039 --> 00:42:02.416
I'd step out, act like nothing happened,

00:42:03.083 --> 00:42:06.503
and eat and watch TV
as if I were none the wiser.

00:42:09.131 --> 00:42:11.884
At the time, I thought
it was just because I was scared,

00:42:13.302 --> 00:42:14.887
but it became clear later.

00:42:16.513 --> 00:42:19.642
That was the start
of my silence and indifference.

00:42:23.604 --> 00:42:27.316
Even as a child, I knew deep down
that domestic violence was a crime.

00:42:28.942 --> 00:42:29.860
I only realized

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:33.280
long after becoming an adult

00:42:33.822 --> 00:42:36.700
that hiding behind the violence,

00:42:37.201 --> 00:42:39.244
looking away, and playing dumb…

00:42:41.914 --> 00:42:44.249
was just as much of a crime.

00:42:48.504 --> 00:42:51.965
I now know that it's not only
deliberate crimes that kill…

00:42:53.759 --> 00:42:56.595
but that lying to oneself
and turning a blind eye

00:42:56.679 --> 00:42:59.473
can, in and of itself, be just as deadly.

00:43:02.184 --> 00:43:04.228
I know this is a tragedy for all of us.

00:43:07.815 --> 00:43:08.899
I, too,

00:43:09.817 --> 00:43:11.902
will sincerely atone for my crimes.

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:37.428
Gye-sun.

00:43:56.488 --> 00:43:58.323
I left home.

00:43:59.825 --> 00:44:01.326
With Eun-hyeok.

00:44:04.705 --> 00:44:06.749
It's not what you think.

00:44:07.624 --> 00:44:11.253
I just packed my things, walked out,
and closed the front door behind me.

00:44:13.964 --> 00:44:15.883
That was all it took.

00:44:17.134 --> 00:44:19.720
Yet for all those years,
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

00:44:24.141 --> 00:44:25.642
I'm sorry

00:44:26.643 --> 00:44:29.188
for putting you
in a children's home for a while

00:44:29.855 --> 00:44:31.315
when you were a kid.

00:44:33.567 --> 00:44:36.028
I know you remember everything.

00:44:37.905 --> 00:44:40.657
Back then,
Eun-hyeok was still just a baby.

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.327
The plan was to leave you there first,

00:44:43.827 --> 00:44:46.663
then leave home with Eun-hyeok.

00:44:47.706 --> 00:44:51.126
But then Eun-hyeok suddenly fell ill…

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:55.380
so I couldn't leave right away.

00:44:58.926 --> 00:45:03.555
Then you told me you wanted to go home,
so I took you out of there immediately,

00:45:04.181 --> 00:45:05.849
but I can only imagine…

00:45:11.355 --> 00:45:14.942
how those ten days must have
left you with an eternal scar.

00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:28.413
At the time,
I thought I still needed a dad,

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:31.542
and I just wanted to live at home.

00:45:33.085 --> 00:45:34.837
I wasn't thinking about you at all.

00:45:37.881 --> 00:45:42.553
All it took were a few naive words from me
to send you back into that house.

00:45:43.637 --> 00:45:47.224
You endured a lifetime of abuse,
all to protect me and Eun-hyeok.

00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:49.852
I knew it all.

00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:54.898
Yet I was scared I'd end up like you.

00:45:57.067 --> 00:45:58.360
I didn't have

00:45:59.027 --> 00:46:01.321
the courage to face the truth…

00:46:04.157 --> 00:46:09.037
so I hid my fear by talking big,
saying I'd never live like you did.

00:46:11.748 --> 00:46:13.709
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.338
Don't say that.

00:46:19.798 --> 00:46:20.966
And

00:46:22.718 --> 00:46:24.136
I know it's long overdue…

00:46:26.555 --> 00:46:27.681
but, Mom…

00:46:29.558 --> 00:46:30.893
thank you.

00:46:43.447 --> 00:46:45.949
Mom, it's your favorite, wildflowers.

00:46:51.288 --> 00:46:52.789
I'm doing well.

00:46:53.624 --> 00:46:55.042
My heart's at ease.

00:47:02.424 --> 00:47:03.884
Inmate 2083.

00:48:22.421 --> 00:48:23.255
Hui-su!

00:48:23.338 --> 00:48:24.256
CHEONGJU WOMEN'S PRISON

00:48:25.257 --> 00:48:26.258
Eun-su!

00:48:40.397 --> 00:48:41.356
Mr. Jin.

00:48:42.274 --> 00:48:44.484
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

00:48:47.696 --> 00:48:49.489
Hey, people don't do this anymore,

00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:51.408
but she insisted we buy it.

00:48:51.908 --> 00:48:53.160
So humor her.

00:48:57.956 --> 00:48:58.790
It's good.

00:48:59.583 --> 00:49:00.417
Is it?

00:49:01.126 --> 00:49:03.420
That's enough of this stuff.
Meat is what you need.

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:04.880
-Let's go.
-Yeah?

00:49:04.963 --> 00:49:05.881
Sounds delicious.

00:49:07.507 --> 00:49:10.719
You guys have a lot of heavy lifting
ahead of you.

00:49:17.476 --> 00:49:18.727
This is nice.

00:49:22.564 --> 00:49:24.941
Mom, Dad, you like this too, don't you?

00:49:31.573 --> 00:49:33.241
Take care, okay?

00:49:35.077 --> 00:49:36.536
I'll come visit soon.

00:50:08.902 --> 00:50:10.612
JINGANG CHINESE MARKET

00:50:13.865 --> 00:50:15.450
Hui-su, check this for me.

00:50:25.669 --> 00:50:27.504
-Is this stuff good for a while?
-Sure.

00:50:27.587 --> 00:50:29.464
-We'll be off, then.
-Okay, see you!

00:50:29.548 --> 00:50:31.716
See you next time!

00:50:38.223 --> 00:50:39.724
Hello.

00:50:39.808 --> 00:50:42.102
What took you so long?

00:50:42.185 --> 00:50:45.397
Everyone's been asking
for instant noodles!

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:46.314
Sorry.

00:50:46.398 --> 00:50:49.025
Is this everything?

00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:49.943
Of course.

00:50:53.071 --> 00:50:54.156
Does this look right?

00:50:54.656 --> 00:50:56.074
It sure does. Should be enough.

00:50:56.158 --> 00:51:00.162
Honey, could you come check
if these quantities are okay?

00:51:00.245 --> 00:51:02.372
All right, let me check for you.

00:51:02.455 --> 00:51:04.958
It's hot, isn't it?
Would you like a drink or something?

00:51:05.041 --> 00:51:06.418
It's nothing we can't handle.

00:51:12.799 --> 00:51:13.633
Here.

00:51:14.342 --> 00:51:17.596
Now get ready to make your wishes.

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:21.057
It's floating!

00:51:42.579 --> 00:51:43.997
Did you make a wish?

00:51:49.753 --> 00:51:50.587
Look.

00:52:01.056 --> 00:52:08.063
THERE IS ALWAYS LIGHT
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL

00:52:13.944 --> 00:52:16.696
I never used to care about the weather,

00:52:18.406 --> 00:52:19.532
but now

00:52:20.867 --> 00:52:23.828
I find myself wondering,
"What kind of sky awaits me today?"

00:52:25.163 --> 00:52:27.749
I actually care about the weather now.

00:52:31.586 --> 00:52:33.546
-Good morning!
-Good morning.

00:52:34.631 --> 00:52:35.632
I'm off.

00:52:36.341 --> 00:52:37.884
-Have a great day.
-Okay!

00:52:50.438 --> 00:52:53.275
Even if good fortune
doesn't come crashing in like waves…

00:52:55.402 --> 00:52:58.405
even if the waves crash hard,
trying to pull me under…

00:53:00.490 --> 00:53:01.658
I've now learned

00:53:03.243 --> 00:53:05.120
how to stand

00:53:05.203 --> 00:53:07.247
and face the waves.

00:53:10.292 --> 00:53:12.210
Because whatever wave tomorrow brings…

00:53:17.007 --> 00:53:18.717
I'll just ride it.

00:56:24.569 --> 00:56:29.574
