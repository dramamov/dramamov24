[Cheolhwan] Wake up time is 6:20 a.m.

00:00:48.028 --> 00:00:50.447
After morning roll call,
you go to breakfast.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.033
Inmates with court hearings
prepare for departure.

00:00:53.116 --> 00:00:55.118
Everyone else goes
to their assigned labor.

00:00:55.202 --> 00:00:57.537
Exercises held
in the morning and afternoon.

00:00:57.621 --> 00:00:59.414
Cells are locked at 5:30 p.m.,

00:00:59.498 --> 00:01:01.875
followed by evening
roll call and then dinner.

00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.251
Lights out at 9:00 p.m.

[inmates shouting]

00:01:04.628 --> 00:01:07.047
Remember, hot water
is turned on once a week.

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:11.635
If you behave yourself
and follow the rules,

00:01:11.718 --> 00:01:13.970
you'll earn a Level One classification

00:01:14.054 --> 00:01:16.056
and receive
a padded jacket for the winter.

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:18.433
You may even be granted parole later on.

00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:20.644
If you're going to be in here a while,

00:01:21.395 --> 00:01:25.565
I would recommend that you take time
to reflect on the choices you have made.

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:26.775
Next person.

00:01:26.858 --> 00:01:28.652
[Cheolhwan] When the day finally comes

00:01:28.735 --> 00:01:31.363
for you to wear
your civilian clothes again,

00:01:31.446 --> 00:01:33.657
I hope by then you'll be a changed man.

LAWYER
KIM SANGRAK

00:01:42.165 --> 00:01:43.417
I'm a public defender.

00:01:44.126 --> 00:01:46.253
I'm not some hotshot lawyer.

00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:50.090
I had a chance to look over your case.

00:01:51.216 --> 00:01:52.467
Something caught my eye.

00:01:56.138 --> 00:01:58.432
They ruled out all other suspects
from the beginning.

00:01:58.765 --> 00:02:00.976
Everything was very calculated.

00:02:01.476 --> 00:02:02.978
It was almost as if they were...

00:02:03.645 --> 00:02:04.771
following the script.

00:02:06.314 --> 00:02:07.315
I, uh...

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.280
I've never seen Chu Nayoung before.

00:02:14.573 --> 00:02:16.158
I promise I'm not lying.

00:02:17.784 --> 00:02:18.994
Still...

00:02:22.414 --> 00:02:24.166
Nobody believes me at all.

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:26.501
I don't agree with the prosecution.

00:02:27.544 --> 00:02:29.212
That's why I wanted to speak with you.

00:02:30.046 --> 00:02:31.339
Please.

00:02:31.423 --> 00:02:33.425
Please help me, sir. I'm begging you.

00:02:33.508 --> 00:02:36.219
I'm telling you the truth.
I swear, I didn't lay a finger on her!

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:39.931
Hmm.

00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:48.732
[beeps]

00:02:48.815 --> 00:02:50.442
Think. Is there anything

00:02:50.525 --> 00:02:53.528
that might be able to corroborate
your version of what happened?

00:02:53.612 --> 00:02:55.906
You've had plenty of time
to think it over.

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.074
Uh... Uh...

00:02:58.158 --> 00:02:59.159
That's all right.

00:03:00.118 --> 00:03:02.037
Try to think through it carefully.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.705
Down to the tiniest detail.

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:05.749
Okay, any details.

00:03:06.374 --> 00:03:08.835
Come to think of it,
there was one thing that stood out.

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:11.338
And it was really concerning.

00:03:11.421 --> 00:03:13.590
-What was it?
-Well...

00:03:13.673 --> 00:03:15.425
during the trial,

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:18.094
I was really out of it,
so I didn't say anything.

00:03:18.178 --> 00:03:20.305
They said they found
a bracelet at the scene, right?

00:03:20.388 --> 00:03:21.848
EXHIBIT PHOTO 2

00:03:23.767 --> 00:03:25.268
Someone else left that.

00:03:25.352 --> 00:03:27.103
I don't know who but it's not mine.

00:03:27.187 --> 00:03:30.273
I mean, I've never been there before,
so there's no way it could be mine.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.901
My bracelet...

00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:36.154
My bracelet...

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.907
It fell off in Taejin's room that night.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.700
-Keep studying.
-I stopped by.

00:03:40.784 --> 00:03:42.452
I took a short nap at his place.

00:03:42.536 --> 00:03:44.871
Then I went straight out
for my delivery shift.

00:03:49.084 --> 00:03:50.460
Are you sure?

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:52.170
[inhales] Yes.

00:03:52.254 --> 00:03:53.255
I'm sure.

00:03:54.673 --> 00:03:56.091
Then we'll need to look into that.

00:03:57.342 --> 00:04:00.011
Do you think that now, with this proof,

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.390
they'll finally admit I didn't do it?

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:05.892
And that I'm actually not a killer?

00:04:08.103 --> 00:04:10.814
We can definitely open
a new angle of investigation.

00:04:11.815 --> 00:04:14.609
Now give me the address
of where your brother is staying.

00:04:14.693 --> 00:04:15.694
I'll look into it.

00:04:15.777 --> 00:04:18.280
Oh, and just to be safe,

00:04:19.447 --> 00:04:22.033
don't tell anyone that
we're looking into your case again.

00:04:22.117 --> 00:04:23.118
-Understood?
-Okay.

00:04:24.452 --> 00:04:25.579
Thank you so much, sir.

00:04:26.705 --> 00:04:27.873
I really appreciate it.

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:31.293

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.841
Something wrong?

00:05:25.597 --> 00:05:27.682
Hey, hey, hey. Where do you
think you're going? Come here!

00:05:27.766 --> 00:05:30.143
-Stay down and shut up.

in your room or something?

[groaning in pain]

00:05:40.153 --> 00:05:41.154
Now listen up.

00:05:41.237 --> 00:05:43.865
If you force me to repeat myself again,

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:45.367
I'll cut off that hand of yours

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.285
and use it as a soccer ball.

00:05:47.369 --> 00:05:48.370

Wow, you messed up big time, didn't ya?

00:06:02.384 --> 00:06:03.385
What for?

00:06:05.679 --> 00:06:07.931
Why? Are you ashamed?

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:10.850
Ashamed to say you raped a girl,

00:06:10.934 --> 00:06:12.143
cut her up,

00:06:12.894 --> 00:06:14.688
and dumped her body in the river?

00:06:16.272 --> 00:06:17.482
I didn't.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:21.695
I didn't do it.

You're really screwed now.

00:07:09.451 --> 00:07:11.453
I heard you raped someone, right?

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.121
Did you like it?

00:07:14.914 --> 00:07:16.082
Yeah. You liked it?

00:07:16.166 --> 00:07:18.334
You want me to give you
something you'll enjoy?

00:07:19.461 --> 00:07:21.296
You enjoying this, huh?

00:07:21.755 --> 00:07:23.548
Hey, why the hell aren't you answering me?

00:07:23.631 --> 00:07:25.049
What? Can't you talk?

00:07:25.133 --> 00:07:27.886
Look at me and I'll kill you,

Stop it! Quit staring at him.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.455
That guy over there is no joke.

Damn, your face is really messed up.

00:08:41.125 --> 00:08:42.877
That guy is Yeo Deoksu.

00:08:42.961 --> 00:08:45.797
He's in charge here.
He's got operations outside too.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.133
When he got here, he was doing life.

00:08:49.217 --> 00:08:50.760
But that asshole was filthy rich,

00:08:50.844 --> 00:08:52.595
and he got it reduced to 12 years.

Hey, hey, come here.

00:08:57.892 --> 00:09:00.270
Yeo Deoksu used to have a little sister.

00:09:00.353 --> 00:09:02.730
But then some bastard
stuck it to her and killed her.

00:09:02.814 --> 00:09:04.440
S... Stuck it?

00:09:05.024 --> 00:09:07.193
-Stuck it to her?
-[sighs in exasperation]

00:09:08.361 --> 00:09:10.155
What are you? Some kind of prude?

00:09:10.238 --> 00:09:11.406
Stuck it, you know?

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.702
That's why you're here, right?

00:09:15.785 --> 00:09:18.496
Yeo Deoksu...
he's famous for tearing apart guys

who come in for that kind of thing.

00:09:20.707 --> 00:09:22.917
Until they get out of here, it's hell.

I'll help you out, all right.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.507
Don't worry. Come on, have some food.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.509
Here. You like potatoes?

00:09:33.261 --> 00:09:35.471
I'll tell you more after we eat, okay?

-It's okay. It's okay. Let's just talk.
-Yeah. It's okay.

-We just wanna talk.
-What are we doing here?

00:09:44.772 --> 00:09:46.232
Don't worry. It's just Yeo Deoksu.

Hey, don't worry. Everything's fine.

00:21:40.571 --> 00:21:41.572
SIT-UPS

00:21:41.655 --> 00:21:43.240
PUSH-UPS
SHADOW JUMPING

00:21:43.324 --> 00:21:45.242
[grunting]

00:21:51.123 --> 00:21:54.919
[breathing heavily]

00:22:06.013 --> 00:22:07.097
Hold him still.

00:22:11.393 --> 00:22:12.394
[grunts]

00:22:13.187 --> 00:22:14.355
So, you think you're tough now?

00:22:14.438 --> 00:22:15.481
How's that?

00:22:24.031 --> 00:22:25.282
[Noh Yongsik] A gift for you.

00:22:25.366 --> 00:22:27.159
Learn to trust in the Lord.

00:22:30.955 --> 00:22:34.792
The Lord will help you build the strength
and resilience that you need to survive.

00:22:36.251 --> 00:22:37.503
And in reading his words,

00:22:37.586 --> 00:22:40.047
you will learn how
to reflect on your sins.

00:22:50.975 --> 00:22:52.851
It's good to see you eating well.

00:22:56.271 --> 00:22:57.564
Hey!

00:23:03.445 --> 00:23:04.780
2802.

00:23:29.054 --> 00:23:31.181
5 YEARS LATER

00:23:40.357 --> 00:23:41.734
[device beeping]

00:23:43.193 --> 00:23:45.654
[cell phone vibrating]

00:23:48.866 --> 00:23:50.325
[cell phone beeps]

00:23:50.409 --> 00:23:53.787
[Yohan] It's a very good thing that
you called me right away. [chuckles]

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:59.209
It'll give me more time
to handle the situation.

00:24:02.546 --> 00:24:04.882
I'll make it seem
as if it never even happened.

00:24:06.091 --> 00:24:08.010
Just think of it as a security detail.

00:24:09.094 --> 00:24:10.304
And once it's all over,

00:24:10.929 --> 00:24:12.723
you and I, Mr. Chairman,

00:24:12.806 --> 00:24:14.516
will be the closest friends.

00:24:19.646 --> 00:24:20.814
[whirring]

00:24:26.945 --> 00:24:29.198
[digital chiming]

00:24:48.008 --> 00:24:50.094
[indistinct chatter]

00:25:04.608 --> 00:25:05.609
[chuckles softly]

00:25:07.069 --> 00:25:09.822
Every time I come here,
more plants are sprouting. [chuckles]

00:25:11.782 --> 00:25:14.618
Hey, why don't you plant
some edible stuff over here, hmm?

00:25:15.536 --> 00:25:17.538
Vegetable prices have gone up a lot.

00:25:21.834 --> 00:25:24.503
That scar on your face
never seems to go away.

00:25:25.295 --> 00:25:27.756
Are the other prisoners
harassing you again?

00:25:29.258 --> 00:25:31.718
I must have stepped on
someone else's vegetables.

00:25:32.928 --> 00:25:34.721
Don't worry, it's no big deal.

00:25:37.099 --> 00:25:38.100
All right.

00:25:39.476 --> 00:25:41.812
Everyone needs a little turf of their own.

00:25:41.895 --> 00:25:43.272
But with that said,

00:25:44.064 --> 00:25:46.650
I still prefer your turf to theirs. Hmm.

00:25:47.359 --> 00:25:48.569
They can try all they want.

00:25:49.194 --> 00:25:51.488
They'll just make things
harder on themselves.

00:25:55.033 --> 00:25:56.201
Here, look.

00:25:56.493 --> 00:25:58.954
Someone recently
gave this to me as a gift.

00:25:59.872 --> 00:26:03.709
But then last week, these black spots
started showing up all over.

00:26:03.792 --> 00:26:05.002
Have you seen this before?

00:26:10.465 --> 00:26:12.384
[sighs] I guess it isn't very common.

00:26:13.385 --> 00:26:15.053
It's nutrient deficiency.

00:26:20.893 --> 00:26:22.311
They gave you a sun-loving plant.

00:26:22.394 --> 00:26:25.480
So if you're keeping it indoors,
it won't survive.

00:26:26.273 --> 00:26:27.274
[Cheolhwan] Ah.

00:26:28.192 --> 00:26:31.403
Leave it with me. I'll make sure
it gets better and I'll repot it for you.

00:26:32.738 --> 00:26:35.157
But you have to bring me
a larger pot, okay?

00:26:35.741 --> 00:26:38.744
All right, so...
it needs a bigger pot to grow.

00:26:40.829 --> 00:26:41.830
Okay.

00:26:43.123 --> 00:26:46.418
I had a feeling
I knew you'd know how to take care of it.

00:26:49.254 --> 00:26:50.255
Thank you.

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:54.760
Hello.

00:27:03.101 --> 00:27:04.102
[chuckles softly]

00:27:04.186 --> 00:27:05.479
Well...

00:27:05.562 --> 00:27:08.857
who would have thought you'd end up
becoming a doctor of plants, huh?

00:27:10.025 --> 00:27:11.944
[chuckles] Oh, here.

00:27:12.027 --> 00:27:13.987
-[Taejoong] What is this?
-Tada!

00:27:14.071 --> 00:27:15.864
What's the occasion, hmm?

00:27:15.948 --> 00:27:17.783
Is there some special holiday
I don't know about?

00:27:17.866 --> 00:27:20.577
I asked Father to get one for me
when he came by today.

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:23.455
-Hmm. Enjoy.
-Mmm.

00:27:26.583 --> 00:27:28.877
I think that if you stay here too long,

00:27:28.961 --> 00:27:31.254
-you just start to wither away.
-Hmm.

00:27:32.589 --> 00:27:35.300
The guys all brag about
the things that they did,

00:27:35.384 --> 00:27:37.260
talking about their priors, as if...

00:27:37.344 --> 00:27:38.428
they're proud of it.

00:27:38.512 --> 00:27:39.680
Like a badge of honor.

00:27:39.763 --> 00:27:43.058
They forget they're supposed to be atoning
for the crimes they committed.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:46.311
Taejoong.

00:27:46.395 --> 00:27:48.689
I hope you stay exactly as you are.

00:27:52.859 --> 00:27:53.860
You seem...

00:27:55.487 --> 00:27:56.780
off today, you know?

00:27:57.447 --> 00:27:58.657
Oh, really?

00:28:00.075 --> 00:28:01.618
Hey, give me your hand.

00:28:01.827 --> 00:28:03.453
-[bracelet jingling]
-Huh?

00:28:06.206 --> 00:28:08.959
[Noh Yongsik] They say you use soap
to wash the dirt off your skin

00:28:09.042 --> 00:28:11.712
and tears to wash away
the sins from your heart.

00:28:12.879 --> 00:28:15.465
I don't really know
what's in your heart, Taejoong, but...

00:28:15.549 --> 00:28:18.093
I hope your days
of shedding tears are behind you.

00:28:22.264 --> 00:28:24.099
Uh, why are you acting so weird?

00:28:26.101 --> 00:28:27.978
I mean, is everything okay?

00:28:30.355 --> 00:28:31.356
I...

00:28:33.483 --> 00:28:35.694
I'm... getting out today.

00:28:40.991 --> 00:28:42.034
Uh-huh.

00:28:43.577 --> 00:28:44.578
Oh.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.582
Oh, and I already spoke to Father.

00:28:48.665 --> 00:28:50.333
I told him today was my last day.

00:28:52.044 --> 00:28:54.838
Which means you'll have to be
his new altar server from now on.

00:28:54.921 --> 00:28:55.922
[Taejoong] Mmm-hmm.

00:28:58.425 --> 00:28:59.885
[sniffles]

00:28:59.968 --> 00:29:00.969
Go on.

00:29:02.637 --> 00:29:04.181
This is really great news.

00:29:06.224 --> 00:29:08.977
Do you have any idea what you're gonna do
once you get out of here?

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:13.690
My dad used to repair electronics,
so I thought I might give that a shot.

00:29:13.774 --> 00:29:14.775
Hmm.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:18.737
I didn't realize
you could still make a living

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.864
off a thing like that, I'm surprised.

00:29:20.947 --> 00:29:22.616
Well, I have to do something.

00:29:25.452 --> 00:29:26.661
[sniffles]

00:29:30.248 --> 00:29:32.751
You could save up some money
and help me open the shop.

00:29:32.834 --> 00:29:33.835
Hmm?

00:29:35.337 --> 00:29:36.797
-Finish.
-Okay.

00:29:40.217 --> 00:29:42.219
[indistinct chatter]

00:29:42.302 --> 00:29:44.805
Looks like spring's
coming early this year.

00:29:48.642 --> 00:29:51.228
Hey, there's something
I always wanted to ask you.

00:29:55.398 --> 00:29:56.775
Why were you so good to me?

00:29:59.778 --> 00:30:01.988
I thought you were the one
being good to me.

00:30:02.072 --> 00:30:03.698
Wasn't that how it always was?

00:30:04.407 --> 00:30:05.867
Not true.

00:30:05.951 --> 00:30:07.410
You were nice from the start.

00:30:09.079 --> 00:30:11.623
But what would you have done
if I turned out to be a weirdo?

00:30:11.706 --> 00:30:13.583
[chuckles]

00:30:13.667 --> 00:30:14.709
Well...

00:30:16.503 --> 00:30:17.504
I just...

00:30:19.172 --> 00:30:21.216
I just wanted to make sure
you kept on living.

00:30:22.759 --> 00:30:23.969
I think that's why.

00:30:51.204 --> 00:30:53.832
No one else would listen
to what I had to say.

00:30:54.791 --> 00:30:56.042
You were the only one.

00:30:57.169 --> 00:30:58.628
Thank you for that.

00:31:03.967 --> 00:31:04.968
[officer] Let's go.

00:31:05.635 --> 00:31:06.636
Yes.

00:31:08.096 --> 00:31:09.097
Now, get going.

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.769
[gate opening]

00:31:22.986 --> 00:31:23.987
Noh Yongsik!

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:26.907
Huh?

00:31:27.741 --> 00:31:29.409
Thank you for everything.

00:31:40.879 --> 00:31:41.880
I'll see you.

00:32:11.243 --> 00:32:13.036
"He who covers his sins will not prosper,

00:32:13.119 --> 00:32:15.622
"but whoever confesses
and forsakes them will have mercy."

00:32:15.705 --> 00:32:17.165
THE HOLY BIBLE

00:32:17.249 --> 00:32:18.416
[exhales softly]

00:32:24.506 --> 00:32:27.008
[inmate] Ha, whoa! Look at this guy.

00:32:27.092 --> 00:32:28.385
Nice moves, huh?

00:32:28.468 --> 00:32:31.554
[inmates laughing and chattering]

00:32:34.849 --> 00:32:36.142
What are you looking at?

00:32:58.206 --> 00:32:59.207
Hmm.

00:33:00.292 --> 00:33:01.459
Come on. It's okay.

00:33:17.225 --> 00:33:18.852
[exhales]

00:33:24.316 --> 00:33:25.317
Eat it.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.985
It's technically not allowed,

00:33:28.028 --> 00:33:30.739
so I didn't want the others
to see you and get the wrong idea.

00:33:33.325 --> 00:33:34.326
It's difficult...

00:33:36.161 --> 00:33:37.579
getting used to living here.

00:33:38.371 --> 00:33:39.539
I know it can be scary,

00:33:40.874 --> 00:33:42.375
but that's only natural.

00:33:43.126 --> 00:33:44.794
Who wouldn't be scared of prison?

00:33:46.171 --> 00:33:47.255
Now, I don't...

00:33:48.048 --> 00:33:49.966
want to pressure you or anything.

00:33:55.847 --> 00:33:56.848
But here...

00:33:58.725 --> 00:34:00.143
consider believing in God.

00:34:01.102 --> 00:34:04.356
God will give you...
the strength to endure.

00:34:05.815 --> 00:34:07.192
And he'll give you courage.

00:34:08.068 --> 00:34:09.402
[breath trembling]

00:34:11.446 --> 00:34:12.739
[Sin-Ib] I've done nothing wrong.

00:34:15.742 --> 00:34:17.202
Listen, what I really want to say is--

00:34:17.285 --> 00:34:21.081
If only I hadn't gone to the park
to find the owner of that phone...

00:34:23.375 --> 00:34:25.502
then I wouldn't be sitting here right now.

00:34:32.759 --> 00:34:33.843
What phone?

00:34:36.346 --> 00:34:39.265
Someone used it to frame me
for a crime I didn't commit.

00:34:41.976 --> 00:34:43.603
[cell phone ringing]

00:34:46.773 --> 00:34:49.150
I found this lost phone

00:34:49.234 --> 00:34:51.820
and the lady said she'd pay me
if I delivered it to her.

00:34:51.903 --> 00:34:53.405
[woman] You just bring it to me yourself.

00:34:53.488 --> 00:34:55.740
I'll pay you 300,000 won for your trouble.

00:34:56.491 --> 00:34:58.576
The whole thing was caught
on security cameras

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.370
and was used against me in court.

00:35:01.371 --> 00:35:03.039
[engine starts]

00:35:07.335 --> 00:35:10.922
They found my belongings and fingerprints
at this hideout that I'd never been to.

00:35:16.886 --> 00:35:18.096
[breathing shakily]

00:35:18.179 --> 00:35:21.349
[voice trembling] I swear to God,
I've never been to that place before.

00:35:24.686 --> 00:35:25.979
[sniffles]

00:35:26.062 --> 00:35:28.815
I thought my alibi would be strong enough.

00:35:32.277 --> 00:35:35.864
This public defender came looking for me,
saying that he wanted to help me.

00:35:35.947 --> 00:35:37.407

LAWYER
KIM SANGRAK

00:35:39.743 --> 00:35:40.910
I'm a public defender.

00:35:41.786 --> 00:35:43.830
I'm not some hotshot lawyer.

00:35:43.913 --> 00:35:45.707
He said there's no proof.

00:35:46.374 --> 00:35:47.375
No record of it.

00:35:52.213 --> 00:35:53.256
That fucking bastard.

00:35:53.339 --> 00:35:55.508
I'm sure he was one of them.
I know he was.

00:35:56.968 --> 00:35:59.053
[Sangrak] Oh, and just to be safe,

00:35:59.137 --> 00:36:02.056
don't tell anyone
that we're looking into your case.

00:36:03.308 --> 00:36:04.309
[Sin-Ib] Then today,

00:36:05.477 --> 00:36:07.979
I was told my mom committed suicide.

00:36:09.647 --> 00:36:11.024
Everything is too overwhelming.

00:36:11.107 --> 00:36:14.360
STUDY WITH ME
GOAL 5 HOURS

00:36:14.444 --> 00:36:16.196
VIDEO CANNOT BE PLAYED

00:36:16.279 --> 00:36:18.782
She always told me
there's no salvation for suicide.

00:36:21.117 --> 00:36:24.204
She'd say life itself is a gift
and spend your time on what truly matters.

00:36:24.287 --> 00:36:26.456
I know my mother.
She wouldn't kill herself.

00:36:27.499 --> 00:36:29.542
Those bastards think they can fool me.

00:36:30.418 --> 00:36:32.420
I see right through their lies.

00:36:32.504 --> 00:36:33.713
Every single one of them.

00:36:33.797 --> 00:36:35.465
[shouts] They won't get away with this!

00:36:35.548 --> 00:36:37.091
[breath trembling]

00:36:37.175 --> 00:36:38.718
I know what they did.

00:36:41.679 --> 00:36:43.640
[breathing heavily]

00:37:06.037 --> 00:37:08.081
[commotion in distance]

00:37:10.625 --> 00:37:11.668
[buzzer blares]

00:37:11.751 --> 00:37:12.752
[officer 1] Over here!

00:37:12.836 --> 00:37:14.754
-[officer 2] Get inside.
-[officer 3] What happened?

00:37:14.838 --> 00:37:15.839
[officer 1] Over here!

00:37:16.589 --> 00:37:17.632
Is he breathing?

00:37:18.258 --> 00:37:20.552
-What happened to him?
-[officer 4] It's a shame.

00:37:21.302 --> 00:37:24.389
He stuffed pages from the Bible
into his mouth and suffocated.

00:37:24.973 --> 00:37:26.432
[panting]

00:37:29.811 --> 00:37:31.437
Get him into the infirmary.

00:37:47.537 --> 00:37:48.538
[gasps]

00:37:58.172 --> 00:38:00.842
[breathing heavily]

00:38:12.854 --> 00:38:14.689
-[door opens]
-[Sangrak] It's been a while.

00:38:14.772 --> 00:38:15.773
[door closes]

00:38:15.857 --> 00:38:17.609
So you have new information?

00:38:19.152 --> 00:38:20.403
That's great.

00:38:20.904 --> 00:38:21.988
[recorder beeps]

00:38:22.071 --> 00:38:23.406
Tell me about it. What is it?

00:38:26.784 --> 00:38:27.785
Mr. Park?

00:38:28.828 --> 00:38:30.538
Can you tell me what it is?

00:38:33.207 --> 00:38:35.835
One of the new inmates
killed himself earlier today.

00:38:37.921 --> 00:38:40.506
But before that, he told me
that you had offered to help him.

00:38:41.341 --> 00:38:42.467
Is that right?

00:38:44.427 --> 00:38:45.553
Uh, yes.

00:38:46.971 --> 00:38:47.972
I heard about that.

00:38:48.973 --> 00:38:50.850
I was afraid he would do
something like this.

00:38:50.934 --> 00:38:52.018
I wanted to help him.

00:38:53.394 --> 00:38:54.729
If I gave you new evidence,

00:38:55.855 --> 00:38:57.106
will you actually help me?

00:38:57.649 --> 00:38:59.943
Yes, of course I will.
That's what I'm here for.

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:02.612
And how are you gonna do that?

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:05.114
[laughs]

00:39:05.198 --> 00:39:06.824
Well, I need to know what you have.

00:39:06.908 --> 00:39:08.034
Tell me this new information.

00:39:09.494 --> 00:39:10.495
Look at me.

00:39:13.164 --> 00:39:15.249
What do you see when you look at me?

00:39:15.333 --> 00:39:17.627
Is this the face
of a cold-blooded murderer?

00:39:19.128 --> 00:39:21.339
Or someone framed to look like one?

00:39:22.799 --> 00:39:23.800
[sighs]

00:39:24.842 --> 00:39:25.885
[beeps]

00:39:26.511 --> 00:39:28.096
Mr. Park, what are you doing right now?

00:39:28.972 --> 00:39:30.098
[Taejoong exhales]

00:39:30.765 --> 00:39:32.392
Do you think I want to be wasting my time?

00:39:33.851 --> 00:39:36.062
Did you tell him
the news about his mother?

00:39:37.563 --> 00:39:38.940
That she committed suicide?

00:39:45.113 --> 00:39:47.281
You don't have any information, do you?

00:39:48.408 --> 00:39:50.952
Did you also tell them
that when you went to see her...

00:39:53.621 --> 00:39:56.124
-she was already dead?
-You lied to me.

00:40:00.003 --> 00:40:01.087
You have no evidence.

00:40:02.839 --> 00:40:04.757
[breath trembling]

00:40:10.763 --> 00:40:12.390
My brother didn't kill himself, did he?

00:40:17.854 --> 00:40:18.855
So who was it?

00:40:21.691 --> 00:40:22.817
Huh?

00:40:24.235 --> 00:40:26.237
You son of a bitch!

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.905
-Answer me!
-[officer] Hey, get in, get in!

00:40:27.989 --> 00:40:30.700
Who killed my brother? Who killed Taejin?

00:40:30.783 --> 00:40:32.618
-[guard] Hey, hey! Get off!
-[Taejoong screams]

00:40:32.702 --> 00:40:34.037
-Hey!
-[Taejoong grunting]

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.705
Get off of him!

00:40:35.788 --> 00:40:37.540
What do you think you're doing, punk?

00:40:37.623 --> 00:40:40.501
-Grab him! Here, grab him! Hold him down!
-It's all right.

00:40:40.585 --> 00:40:41.878
Let him go.

00:40:41.961 --> 00:40:43.838
[panting]

00:40:45.006 --> 00:40:48.551
What? It's been years,
and you still haven't moved on?

00:40:48.634 --> 00:40:49.635
Seriously?

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.723
[groans]

00:40:53.806 --> 00:40:54.807
Fine.

00:40:55.475 --> 00:40:56.476
Let's say you're right.

00:40:56.559 --> 00:40:58.061
And someone really wanted to frame you.

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.397
So they planted
that phone there on purpose

00:41:01.481 --> 00:41:03.483
to make sure that
you were caught on camera

00:41:03.566 --> 00:41:05.109
and you fell for it all.

00:41:05.193 --> 00:41:06.360
[engine starts]

00:41:06.444 --> 00:41:09.489
-And then they erased all the evidence...
-[Taejin] It was here all along.

00:41:09.572 --> 00:41:10.615
[sighs]

00:41:10.698 --> 00:41:11.699
SUJI
TAEJOONG'S BRACELET...

00:41:14.869 --> 00:41:16.412
...and they killed your brother.

00:41:20.041 --> 00:41:22.335
Everything is too overwhelming.

00:41:25.296 --> 00:41:27.006
What difference does it make?

00:41:28.216 --> 00:41:29.383
Huh?

00:41:31.636 --> 00:41:33.679
Man, you've got to let this thing go.

00:41:34.722 --> 00:41:37.058
It would be easier
to convince yourself that you did it.

00:41:38.142 --> 00:41:41.104
Out there, murder is a crime,
but in here it's like a badge of honor.

00:41:43.356 --> 00:41:46.901
Hey, if you think about it,
your brother died because of you.

00:41:46.984 --> 00:41:49.278
It's your fault he's dead,
fucking dumbass!

00:41:50.905 --> 00:41:51.906
Who killed Taejin?

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:55.785
Did you do it?

00:41:57.036 --> 00:41:58.329
Yes.

00:41:58.412 --> 00:41:59.956
I killed Taejin.

00:42:00.039 --> 00:42:01.165
You...

00:42:01.999 --> 00:42:03.126
I swear to God...

00:42:03.835 --> 00:42:05.837
I am gonna find a way to kill you.

00:42:06.712 --> 00:42:07.922
You're fucking dead!

00:42:09.924 --> 00:42:10.925
Locked in here?

00:42:11.509 --> 00:42:12.927
And how are you gonna do that?

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:14.387
[laughs mockingly]

00:42:23.521 --> 00:42:24.772
Here's a piece of advice.

00:42:25.773 --> 00:42:28.985
Why don't you write a suicide note,
then hang yourself?

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:30.611
You never know...

00:42:32.405 --> 00:42:33.698
they could reopen the case.

00:42:35.116 --> 00:42:37.660
[laughs maliciously]

00:42:42.707 --> 00:42:44.083
He's all yours. We're done.

00:42:46.794 --> 00:42:48.796

00:43:02.226 --> 00:43:03.269
We've been compromised.

00:43:03.352 --> 00:43:04.520
I think we need cleanup.

00:43:06.522 --> 00:43:08.024
Argh! Son of a bitch!

00:43:24.624 --> 00:43:26.792
[breathing heavily]

00:43:28.044 --> 00:43:29.295
Yes? What's going on?

00:43:30.213 --> 00:43:31.505
What's the emergency?

00:43:31.797 --> 00:43:33.799
Sorry for calling so late.

00:43:33.883 --> 00:43:36.177
I... needed to tell you something.

00:43:37.762 --> 00:43:38.763
From now on...

00:43:40.056 --> 00:43:41.641
"HOLY BIBLE"

00:43:42.308 --> 00:43:44.560
...I can no longer be your altar server.

00:43:44.644 --> 00:43:45.895
Why not?

00:43:45.978 --> 00:43:47.313
Are you feeling unwell?

00:43:48.272 --> 00:43:50.733
There's something
Noh Yongsik once told me.

00:43:52.735 --> 00:43:54.695
I must think of myself as already dead.

00:43:57.156 --> 00:43:59.283
And consider this new life
a gift from God.

00:44:06.499 --> 00:44:09.168
[Sangrak] If you think about it,
your brother died because of you.

00:44:09.794 --> 00:44:12.046
It's your fault he's dead,
fucking dumbass.

00:44:12.296 --> 00:44:13.589
I swear to God,

00:44:14.048 --> 00:44:16.175
I am gonna find a way to kill you.
