[Blood River]

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.980
[Based on the novel of the same name from Zhou Munan's Youth in Jianghu series]

[Available on fanqienovel.com & bkneng.com]

[Episode 35]

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.460
There's a 50% chance

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.740
you'll be able to take Yong's life.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.660
I do want to try.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.850
But you'll die too.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.690
I think that price

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:56.850
is not worth it.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.330
Yeah.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.020
Staying alive matters more.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.260
I'm really angry right now, though.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.500
Your miracle physician

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.220
wrecked our plan.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.130
Plan?

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.820
You never told me

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.130
any plan of yours.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.010
Before I went into seclusion,

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.100
I told them

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.010
not to act rashly.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.540
Just keep the clinic open.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.610
So why did keeping the clinic open

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.100
bring deadly trouble?

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.130
Sir,

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.260
It's all

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.570
just a misunderstanding.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.810
Just some

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.980
sudden turns.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.100
But now,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.820
we're curious

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.730
whether...

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.060
you and Master Su

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.890
picked different allies.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.290
Su Muyu doesn't know my choice.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.170
He's still all in on the Prince of Langya.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.010
I don't agree.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.010
The Prince of Langya can give him

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.780
the help he wants

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.890
but not me.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.540
Because I want to be No.1 in the jianghu.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.940
From the first time I met you,

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:30.780
I knew,

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.340
Sir,

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.100
you were ambitious.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.290
This is a truth-testing snake,

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.820
a gift sent to me

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.100
from Nanjue.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.450
It carries a rare poison

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.690
that kills on contact.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.010
Yet it's gentle by nature.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.220
When you touch it

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.100
in ordinary times,

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.060
it won't react at all.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.610
But if you touch it

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.730
while telling a lie,

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.980
it can sense

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.130
even the slightest change.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.850
And it will snap at you.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.540
Sir,

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.540
care to try?

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.170
Interesting.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.140
Why did you and Master Su

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.100
choose differently?

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.930
Why not side with the Prince of Langya?

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.020
Just like you,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.250
once you're high up,

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.930
the next step is reaching the peak.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.780
Even with the Prince of Langya helping us,

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.930
Xueyue City stays No.1.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.980
But if you

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.610
topple the Prince of Langya,

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.720
then Blood River

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.980
will become emperor of the jianghu.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.340
Bold talk.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.810
"Emperor of the jianghu"?

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.020
That's quite the arrogance.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.810
If Su Muyu

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.020
blocks our plan,

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.490
would you kill him?

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.340
Kill Su Muyu?

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.780
Don't ask something so out of line.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.410
That's costly.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.140
It doesn't matter

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:51.780
who you will kill

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.540
or won't kill.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.020
We share an enemy,

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.660
and that's enough.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.100
Next,

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.540
I'll tell you

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.730
our plan.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.250
I hope your plan

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.320
won't let me down.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.370
My patience is limited.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.140
Then we start

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.900
from His Majesty's accession.

[Qiushui Cottage]

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.380
Good wine.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.850
It goes straight to the head.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.410
Tonight,

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.540
you've drunk plenty.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.290
Because I won't get drunk tonight.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.220
Shameless as it sounds,

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.580
a by-any-means plan

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.460
to reach the goal.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.590
But it suits me,

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.750
perfectly.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:58.660
Then, Sir...

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.170
Tianqi City will be yours.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.700
Changhe,

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:28.610
since you left seclusion,

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.730
you seem different.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.290
Nonsense.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.900
I've barely been out.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.730
It's not about time.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.360
You just look

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.730
harder to read.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.410
Is it because of the Hell Palm?

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.490
That old man Mu said...

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.250
No need to worry.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.370
I know what I'm doing.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.540
When have I ever lied to you?

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.340
You have.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.170
You said you'd found a great place,

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.190
no worries about food or drink.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.320
And then,

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.490
you dragged me into Blood River.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.170
Blame it on Su Muyu.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:06.580
But look at you,

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.930
you're grown,

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.100
yet still like a kid,

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.490
rambling,

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.490
and worrying.

When will you stand on your own?

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:15.810
No matter.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:17.460
As long as I'm here,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.580
you can stay behind me.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:23.810
So,

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.900
do we go find Muyu and the others?

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.340
No.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.700
And don't tell them I'm out.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:34.980
Tonight,

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.300
I'll take a good walk around Tianqi City.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.490
Changhe,

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:40.700
we really don't tell Muyu?

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.490
He won't agree.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:45.530
I have my plan.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.580
Have you found where they are?

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.220
They pride themselves on hiding.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.300
And we're good at tracking.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.250
Your Highness,

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.820
we've located Su Muyu

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:21.700
and their hideout.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:25.820
Your Highness,

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.220
a report from General Dian Ye:

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.530
His Majesty has granted him authority

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.340
to sweep the city for the General's Residence assassins

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:31.980
and execute them on the spot.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.650
Interesting.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.990
But we just met

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.020
with Su Changhe

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.210
and strike them next,

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:45.980
isn't that a bit...

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.370
What Su Muyu does

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.580
isn't Su Changhe's to control.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.770
Likewise, how can I control

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.940
what the Flying Tiger General

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:57.850
wants?

Give that hideout location

to my uncle,

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.420

do as he sees fit.

Understood.

No big problem.

Good.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:29.460
Many are coming.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:30.340
Besides the Jinwu Guard,

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.250
other masters are heading this way.

and the miracle physician first.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.370
I'll stay and hold them off.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:41.770
You alone

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:42.700
are too dangerous!

Right now,

So, I call the shots in Blood River.

You should all listen to me.

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:25.460
What truly matters now

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:27.220
is the Dragonseal Scroll.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.420
Tell me,

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:33.620
what if

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:35.900
the Dragonseal Scroll appears

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:37.940
with my name on it,

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.700
and I refuse?

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:40.730
What will happen?

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:44.180
If the throne is unrightful,

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:45.660
any with dragon's blood

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:46.810
can claim it,

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:48.980
and the realm falls to chaos.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.250
The Langya army in the south

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:55.250
is already locked in fierce battle.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.380
And my father...

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.490
is at death's door.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.140
Tianqi's main guardians

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.290
have all been redeployed.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.460
Your health is this poor.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:12.810
And the Imperial Assembly is near,

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:14.490
when all the generals and lords

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:15.660
will converge on Tianqi.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.250
If someone steers it,

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.730
if chaos comes,

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:22.810
you won't hold it down.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:26.860
Xueyue Sword Deity,

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.530
your first point

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:29.900
was exactly right.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.220
Right now,

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:33.420
the Dragonseal Scroll

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:34.730
is the bigger problem

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:35.900
to solve.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.530
But,

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.900
I've searched for years

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.330
and never found it.

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.180
So I'll wait for the day

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.490
they can't hold back.

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:46.330
They'll make a play at the Imperial Assembly.

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:48.370
I just need the chance

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.620
to intercept it

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:51.620
before it appears.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:52.940
That's all.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.620
So,

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.330
one thing you said

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.530
was off.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.730
Listen,

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:02.700
here in Tianqi,

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.010
no matter when chaos breaks,

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:08.380
I, Xiao Ruofeng,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.010
can always hold it down.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:22.940
How's it going?

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:24.220
Where is Master Mu?

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:26.490
Ms. Wan'er's home is burned to the ground.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:27.940
The Jinwu Guard

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:29.140
lines the whole lane.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.380
They claim

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:31.770
all ones inside

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.010
were slain.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.420
Then...

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:39.380
Master Mu and Miss Xuewei...

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:41.660
The guard is tight.

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:43.940
We found no chance to slip in,

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:45.530
so we saw no bodies.

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:47.050
Maybe,

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:48.900
it's planted news

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:50.050
to mislead us.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.570
If they escaped,

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:53.570
they should've reached us by now!

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:03.180
A squad of soldiers

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:04.290
have surrounded this area too.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.090
Are they Jinwu Guard too?

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:07.250
No.

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:08.010
Doesn't look like it.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.220
I'm Jia Feng, Commander of the Inner Security Division.

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.980
By order of the Prince of Langya,

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.380
I'm here to protect you.

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.570
Under an investigation,

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:27.110
[Kind Heart, Skilled Hands]

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:28.500
I've completely sealed off

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:29.250
three nearby alleys.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.460
Be it the Jinwu Guard and the Court of Judicial Review,

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:33.570
none of their men can set foot here.

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:35.420
If you're here to investigate,

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.490
I'll ask your Prince of Langya

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:38.530
for one person.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:40.700
Name him.

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:42.140
The son of Li Xian, Deputy Commander

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.250
of the Jinwu Guard.

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:45.730
Understood.

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:48.140
I'll take my leave.

Su Muyu...

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:05.940
Last night,

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:08.180
Master Mu and Xuewei

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.700
stayed behind in that courtyard.

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:23.050
What's wrong?

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:24.460
A spider bit me...

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:25.220
What?

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:26.010
- Spider? - Spider?

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.180
- Spider... - Spider...

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.330
It's a tracking Spider.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.460
Tracking Spider?

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:32.620
- Tracking Spider! - Tracking Spider!

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:34.420
Last time,

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:35.730
someone was bitten at Doom Abyss.

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:36.460
Was that you?

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:38.090
Yes.

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:40.620
I thought I was just unlucky.

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:43.530
- Run! - Now!

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:44.940
That way!

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:46.940
- Move! - Go!

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:54.940
Useless!

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:56.940
Tell the guards outside.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:57.900
Run!

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:58.700
Got it!

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:04.570
Stay back!

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:05.700
Stay back!

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:06.220
Trying to run away?

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.050
Too late.

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:12.660
Spider Woman.

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:14.090
It's me.

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:28.940
Your signal arrow won't help now.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.290
Everyone in this manor

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.700
has already been dealt with.

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:39.570
As expected of the Xuanwu Guardian from Tang Clan

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:41.980
and Blood River's Spider Woman,

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:45.180
you kill without a sound.

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.770
Come with me.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.730
Confess everything.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:52.620
Watch out!

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.490
Haze swept clear,

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.250
moon shines afar.

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:14.940
Everyone,

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.810
I'll go on ahead.

What now?

He was struck by snake venom.

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:33.290
What do we do with the people here?

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.380
Don't kill me!

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:39.860
I'll send word for the Inner Security Division

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:40.940
to seal this place off.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:43.140
Their identities are too sensitive.

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:46.660
For now, we can't let them

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:47.460
return to Tianqi.

Your Highness.

Fengxi Manor was attacked.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:03.860
The area was sealed

Your Highness doesn't seem to care.

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:15.090
Just a bunch of pieces.

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:17.180
Since they're pieces,

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.140
whose hand they fall into

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:20.810
makes no difference.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:23.900
You may go.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:27.530
Let them hold that hot potato

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.620
and really savor

Those who back us

will gather in Tianqi.

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:01.330
Plus that powerful item,

this will become the best chance

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:27.460
Since he didn't detain me at court,

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.330
it means he tacitly allows my moves.

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:33.570
He might even be waiting

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:55.050

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:58.300
We staked out half a day for an opening.

00:33:58.550 --> 00:33:59.700
With the Inner Security Division's help,

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.010
we slipped into the courtyard

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:03.900
and took all the important items

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.050
Master Mu had hidden in advance.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.170
Still no bodies found?

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.460
No.

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:15.650
Only this.

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:36.860
Have the Inner Security Division men outside

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:38.610
send word to the Prince of Langya.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.650
On cooperation,

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:43.090
I'll assist him with all my strength.

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:45.690
But aside from that,

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:49.130
Blood River has debts in Tianqi

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:50.050
to be paid in blood.

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:52.490
We will not leave

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:53.780
until they're settled.

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:58.300
If this runs against his plan,

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:01.900
tell him not to block us.

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:03.570
Understood.

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:09.780
What happened,

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:10.850
Muyu?

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:12.570
What exactly happened?

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.610
I just passed by Ms. Wan'er's place

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.460
and found the whole courtyard burned down.

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.210
And on my way back,

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:20.210
Men of the Inner Security Division were everywhere.

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:23.340
Did...

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:25.740
something happen?

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.980
That base was exposed last night.

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:31.740
We were attacked in the night.

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:34.710
Uncle Zhe had just used the Divine-Demon Nirvana Art

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:35.610
to finish healing me.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:37.940
We couldn't fight

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.690
and had to withdraw.

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:42.860
Qingyang and Xuewei stayed to cover us,

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:45.530
and they didn't make it back.

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.980
What do you mean...

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.820
they didn't make it back?

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.740
Yu,

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:14.860
we used to treat

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:18.050
a partner's death

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:19.820
as something

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.130
we took for granted.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.090
But now,

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:26.130
everything is different.

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:31.260
On the road to the Other Shore,

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:34.490
how many partners

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:35.650
will we lose?

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.050
What about Changhe?

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:49.530
Where is he?

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:55.940
I've already sent Yin the Tiger

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:56.900
to call him back.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:00.010
This isn't the time for seclusion.

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:02.380
Yu,

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:04.380
the Patriarch is no longer in the chamber.

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:07.610
He's gone?

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:09.460
That means

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.210
he's completed training and left seclusion,

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:12.860
yet didn't return to us at once.

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:16.210
Where did he go?

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:19.300
Su Muyu,

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.610
has he ever acted on his own

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:24.170
without telling you?

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.210
In my memory,

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.490
only once.

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:29.610
When?

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.090
When he tried to kill the former patriarch

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:35.260
to seize the Dormant Dragon Sword.

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:38.860
Maybe

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.460
the Patriarch has other plans?
