00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.799
I'm a policeman, not a criminal.

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:57.519
Do I look like a criminal?

00:01:57.519 --> 00:02:00.439
(Stop)

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.519
- Where are you going?
- To the coffee shop ahead.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.920
I can get there myself.

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.000
- I'll walk you there.
- No need.

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.719
I go there every day.

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:09.680
I can go there on my own.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.039
It's a short walk.

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:12.280
I feel obligated

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.319
to walk you there as an officer.

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:19.120
Is this

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.599
congenital or...

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.560
- An accident.
- Getting treatment?

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:25.479
It's just for comfort.

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:27.680
I've come to terms with it.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.159
Positive mindset.

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:31.719
That's all I have left.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.400
Officer.

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.319
I'm almost there.

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:36.879
I can get there myself.

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:37.960
Alright.

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:39.639
Take care of yourself.

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:08.039
He's quite skilled,
with both hands at a time.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.639
Impressive.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.319
It looks pretty good.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.719
So skilled.

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:15.520
He's also doing it.

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:16.400
He seems

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.120
more skilled.

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:18.360
I'm not sure.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.800
Let's taste the coffee.

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:22.120
Alright then.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.719
It's so tasty.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.000
I agree.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.840
His coffee tastes better.

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:28.479
Hidden talent.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.439
Two to one.

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:31.319
Not bad.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.199
How about this?

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.960
Miss.

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:35.439
You ordered a pour-over.

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:36.719
I bet you know coffee.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.719
Please evaluate these two cups.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.319
Pick the one you prefer.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.599
Three to one. Total defeat.
Three to one.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.759
Just as I expected.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.120
No way.

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.599
I told you this one is better.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:13.719
I prefer this cup.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.599
Try again.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.040
They're similar.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:16.839
Not at all.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:17.480
Miss.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:18.879
My treat.

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:21.079
Are you the owner?

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.279
He's my friend.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.680
Are you the barista?

00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:24.839
No, I learned

00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:26.079
coffee-making with him.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.079
I learned it

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.879
purely out of

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:29.000
personal interest.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:30.120
That's why

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.240
I'm slightly better

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:32.720
than the baristas.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.160
Your coffee has a clean aroma.

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.240
Your brewing technique

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:38.560
seemed simple.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.360
All those fancy tricks

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.000
are just for show.

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:43.759
The key lies in speed

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:45.040
and temperature.

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:46.600
I'm much faster than average,

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:47.920
resulting in purer flavor.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.160
Anything else?

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.920
What are you reading?

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:01.000
"Dune".

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.959
Science fiction.

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:04.319
A friend of mine

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.360
runs an escape room

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:06.720
with a sci-fi theme.

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:08.519
They're organizing trial sessions.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.560
Why not

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.439
(Big Hui)
try it with me?

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:13.680
Sorry, I can't.

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:14.800
What's the problem?

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.199
We'll bond through the game.

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:18.279
I really can't.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.240
What about camping?
Let's have pour-over coffee

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:22.639
in the wild.

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:23.879
It will be different.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.040
Sorry, I also can't.

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:28.360
You're really reluctant, huh?

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.439
Camping doesn't require

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.560
much thinking.

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:33.480
Anyone with hands and feet can do it.

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:38.519
Big Hui, right?

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.639
Your coffee is great.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.959
But I have to go now.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.120
I hope

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:44.160
I'll get to

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:45.399
try your brew again.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.319
Sorry,

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:47.199
I-I didn't notice.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.079
Don't apologize.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.319
I'm glad

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.079
you didn't notice I'm disabled.

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:52.040
I had felt

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.399
normal for a few minutes.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.480
Don't bother. I got this.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.319
Why didn't you tell me?

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:07.959
How do I know you hit on her?

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.759
Nobody has

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:11.800
hit on me for a while.

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:12.879
Thanks.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.959
N-No problem.

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:30.639
Today,

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:32.040
I visited Dad.

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:34.240
Is he okay?

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.160
No, he's in a terrible mood.

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:39.160
Last year, I told you

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.279
my parents wanted

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:41.240
some money back.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.000
You said after New Year's Day.

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:44.199
But

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:45.680
it's almost October.

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:50.040
Do they know about the fire accident
at my studio last year?

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:51.199
Of course.

00:06:53.519 --> 00:06:54.360
So they know

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:55.800
how much the rebuilding costs

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:57.800
and how many pieces I lost.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.959
That's why

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.879
I haven't pressed you for ten months.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.759
This is

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:05.199
a tough time.

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:06.560
- We need...
- Right now,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.079
you're a master who's come back

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.160
with much greater influence.

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:12.399
Yeah,

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.560
but turning my influence into wealth

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.000
still takes time.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.800
Fine.

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:25.759
I'll wait.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.439
I'll hurry up.

00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:34.120
Not coming home again?

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.279
Yeah.

00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:37.240
I need to work overtime at the studio.

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:39.199
You know I have so many

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.160
undelivered works.

00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:41.879
Yeah, I know.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.399
You've worked hard.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.680
I'll go upstairs myself.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.240
Don't block the path

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.560
with your car.

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:00.399
Alright.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:01.720
Go home

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:03.000
and get some rest.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.680
All I do is rest.

00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:08.720
You're the one who needs rest.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.560
I'm okay.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.000
Don't stay up late.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.560
If anything comes up,

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:15.920
call me.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:33.039
Come on.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.200
What?

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.519
I got designated drivers for both of us.

00:08:38.209 --> 00:08:41.121
(Designated driver)

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.919
Nice.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:44.960
So tell me,

00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:46.240
any updates lately?

00:08:47.639 --> 00:08:48.279
I toast you.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.480
Big Hui, I told you

00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:53.720
that I need something solid

00:08:53.759 --> 00:08:54.399
to go on.

00:08:54.759 --> 00:08:56.120
Without any evidence,

00:08:56.279 --> 00:08:56.759
I really...

00:08:57.039 --> 00:08:58.480
I toast to your police badge.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.559
I didn't investigate you.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.879
I just happened to learn that

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:06.080
your badge number

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.559
was reactivated twice.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.320
(Li Shen)

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:26.960
Mom.

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:44.519
(Not the police academy!)

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:45.759
Dad told you

00:09:45.759 --> 00:09:47.120
to work on academics or research.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.399
Why the police academy?

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.039
Your scores were better.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.960
But you joined the force!

00:09:52.879 --> 00:09:53.440
I have to

00:09:53.639 --> 00:09:54.879
reactivate Dad's badge number.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.799
I don't want it

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.159
to remain archived forever.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.360
Listen to me, okay?

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:13.960
Our family

00:10:14.039 --> 00:10:15.399
doesn't need a third officer.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.360
Study something else.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.320
It'll put Mom's mind at ease.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.360
(My dad drank with my brother.)

00:10:31.919 --> 00:10:32.960
I never drank with them.

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:34.120
Li De.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:35.879
I respect you.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.080
I respect your whole family.

00:10:42.879 --> 00:10:43.799
That's enough.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:44.799
I don't

00:10:44.799 --> 00:10:45.840
want to start crying.

00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:48.200
Come on.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.320
Tell me

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:50.840
your news.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.279
I met this girl

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.799
a few days ago.

00:10:54.679 --> 00:10:55.799
Well, not exactly.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.799
But we did meet.
I don't have her WeChat.

00:10:59.399 --> 00:10:59.879
Wait.

00:11:00.039 --> 00:11:00.600
What?

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.559
Listen.

00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:02.200
This girl

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.399
is not exactly normal.

00:11:04.559 --> 00:11:04.960
Good.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.000
Just like you.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:06.799
Come on.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.080
She's...

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.279
Did you tell her

00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:10.120
that you're

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:11.639
looking for your ex-girlfriend?

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.200
We didn't talk that much.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.000
I haven't gotten
her contact information.

00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:17.519
I'm looking for

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.480
my ex-girlfriend?

00:11:18.799 --> 00:11:20.240
It's an investigation.

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:21.879
Nothing about feelings.

00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:22.960
You could say

00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:25.600
i-it's an occupational habit.

00:11:25.919 --> 00:11:27.279
Since she's as abnormal as you,

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:27.960
she should

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.039
understand you.

00:11:29.559 --> 00:11:31.519
She might even help
look for your ex-girlfriend.

00:11:31.679 --> 00:11:32.120
No.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:32.919
Investigate.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:33.759
Yeah.

00:11:33.919 --> 00:11:34.360
Enough.

00:11:34.519 --> 00:11:35.440
Whatever you say.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:36.600
You'll meet her

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.759
once I get to know her.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:38.799
Seriously though,

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.559
how's your investigation going?

00:11:41.799 --> 00:11:43.240
I met Zeng Jie the other day.

00:11:43.759 --> 00:11:44.279
And?

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.960
I returned empty-handed.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.039
He's clean?

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.679
Absolutely clean,

00:11:50.879 --> 00:11:52.200
which is exactly the problem.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.200
You see,

00:11:53.399 --> 00:11:54.240
logically speaking,

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.519
having no problems
is a problem in itself.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.360
Big Hui,

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.279
this isn't deduction anymore.

00:11:59.559 --> 00:12:00.840
It's conjecture and delusion.

00:12:01.159 --> 00:12:02.279
Assumptions lead to

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.039
problems.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:03.639
Got it?

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:04.440
I haven't mentioned

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:04.960
the problems.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:05.840
You said he's clean.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.600
If

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:17.960
you find Liu Wei,

00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:19.519
what will you tell her?

00:12:21.679 --> 00:12:22.639
I don't know.

00:12:24.279 --> 00:12:25.000
(We lock eyes.)

00:12:28.519 --> 00:12:29.320
(She disappears.)

00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:31.279
(I smile.)

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.080
There's nothing

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.639
I want to say.

00:12:36.879 --> 00:12:38.320
I just want to know she's safe.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.120
But I know she's not safe.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.679
You know what scares me most?

00:12:49.799 --> 00:12:50.320
Come here.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.679
What's happening?

00:12:51.679 --> 00:12:52.200
Get in here.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.039
What's happening?

00:12:54.279 --> 00:12:55.039
Let me go.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Let me go.

00:12:57.159 --> 00:12:58.440
What are you doing? Let me go.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:12:59.840
(She was sold to)

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.240
(a remote mountain village)

00:13:01.399 --> 00:13:03.039
(not marked on any map and couldn't be)

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.159
(pinned down on one)

00:13:04.879 --> 00:13:06.559
(to marry a man who's too poor)

00:13:06.679 --> 00:13:08.960
(to afford a wife for his entire life.)

00:13:09.639 --> 00:13:11.320
(Imagine a college-educated)

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.440
(beauty streamer who ends up)

00:13:14.399 --> 00:13:15.120
(as the wife)

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.679
(of a stranger in a village)

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.120
(that likely)

00:13:18.159 --> 00:13:19.440
(has no internet access.)

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:21.440
No decent food.

00:13:21.559 --> 00:13:23.200
No bed to sleep in.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.080
With constant fear,
she is plotting to escape

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.120
every waking moment.

00:13:28.759 --> 00:13:29.679
But every time,

00:13:29.679 --> 00:13:31.159
the villagers catch her.

00:13:31.759 --> 00:13:32.399
Then they

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:33.720
beat her up.

00:13:34.159 --> 00:13:36.720
(It's been a year.
She's probably been forced)

00:13:36.879 --> 00:13:37.559
(to bear)

00:13:37.559 --> 00:13:38.720
(that old man's child.)

00:13:39.039 --> 00:13:39.799
(No one will ever)

00:13:39.799 --> 00:13:40.919
(call her Vivian again.)

00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:42.480
(They only call her...)

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:49.759
No way.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:51.679
How do you know?

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.120
Such tragedies have happened before.

00:13:54.759 --> 00:13:56.600
Nationwide surveillance coverage

00:13:56.799 --> 00:13:57.919
is extremely high now.

00:13:58.279 --> 00:13:59.000
If someone

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.519
is abducted in public,

00:14:00.679 --> 00:14:02.360
we will notice immediately.

00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:04.120
Let's hope so.

00:14:04.519 --> 00:14:05.840
What do you mean by that?

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.480
I'm begging you.

00:14:07.799 --> 00:14:08.879
Stop being

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.000
so paranoid.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.919
By your made-up logic,

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:12.639
did Liu Wei

00:14:12.919 --> 00:14:14.000
text you

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.360
a breakup notice

00:14:15.399 --> 00:14:16.399
while she was

00:14:16.519 --> 00:14:17.399
being kidnapped?

00:14:17.559 --> 00:14:18.159
I told you.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.919
That is my worst fear.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:21.960
If it's true,

00:14:22.519 --> 00:14:23.679
that's pure horror,

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.200
worse than death.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.759
That scenario was made up.

00:14:31.279 --> 00:14:32.080
But Wei is gone

00:14:32.159 --> 00:14:33.159
for real.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:34.960
You agree, right?

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:36.559
Yeah.

00:14:37.759 --> 00:14:38.679
Would you like to hear

00:14:38.679 --> 00:14:39.639
my theory?

00:14:41.279 --> 00:14:42.960
Don't play the silent cool guy.

00:14:43.159 --> 00:14:44.080
Just listen to me.

00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:45.960
Point out anything that doesn't

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.000
make sense.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.039
Go on.

00:14:49.879 --> 00:14:50.360
Go on.

00:14:50.799 --> 00:14:51.320
First,

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.200
I must admit

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.480
that my relationship

00:14:54.639 --> 00:14:55.480
with her

00:14:55.759 --> 00:14:57.080
was doomed from the start.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.440
(We both knew it deep down.)

00:14:59.559 --> 00:15:00.679
(Without a stable income,)

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.240
(we had big dreams)

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.360
(but no plans.)

00:15:03.639 --> 00:15:05.159
(We were both)

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.279
(aimless.)

00:15:06.559 --> 00:15:07.799
(Considering all that,)

00:15:07.919 --> 00:15:09.480
(we were bound to break up.)

00:15:10.039 --> 00:15:11.080
(With her qualities,)

00:15:11.399 --> 00:15:12.720
(she could easily find)

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.279
(a wealthier guy than me.)

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.279
(But)

00:15:15.639 --> 00:15:16.600
(she's cool.)

00:15:17.159 --> 00:15:17.879
(She only cares)

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.320
(about her feelings.)

00:15:19.759 --> 00:15:21.440
So when Zeng Jie appeared,

00:15:21.679 --> 00:15:22.480
she was charmed.

00:15:22.879 --> 00:15:24.000
She talked about

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.080
near-perfection

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.679
and blemish flaws.

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:28.559
Facing a young master painter

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.600
and a professor

00:15:30.159 --> 00:15:31.039
with wealth,

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.360
even I would have

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.159
chosen him as a partner.

00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:36.120
But

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:38.480
Wei wasn't being fickle

00:15:38.759 --> 00:15:40.000
or gold-digging.

00:15:40.279 --> 00:15:41.559
We simply didn't have

00:15:41.759 --> 00:15:42.399
enough time

00:15:42.679 --> 00:15:44.519
to deepen our bond.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.679
At least, she showed me respect

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:47.519
and broke up with me

00:15:47.919 --> 00:15:48.559
when she

00:15:48.799 --> 00:15:50.039
started dating Zeng Jie.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.600
You call this respect?

00:15:52.879 --> 00:15:53.679
Yeah.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:54.919
At least,

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.240
she didn't cheat on me.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:58.840
Ridiculous.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.399
Why is it ridiculous?

00:16:01.159 --> 00:16:02.919
Let me speak up for Wei here.

00:16:03.919 --> 00:16:05.080
She did well

00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:06.840
by breaking up with me.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:07.919
She respected

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.279
both Zeng Jie

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.320
and me.

00:16:13.799 --> 00:16:14.799
But the problem is,

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.879
she gets attached too easily.

00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:17.919
I told you

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.279
how we started dating.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:20.639
Isn't it

00:16:21.159 --> 00:16:21.960
completely absurd?

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.320
But we just

00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:24.759
started dating.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.360
Wei has always

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.360
been insecure since childhood.

00:16:28.679 --> 00:16:30.840
So if some small gesture

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.759
makes her feel secure,

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.679
she genuinely develops feelings.

00:16:35.039 --> 00:16:35.679
Zeng Jie

00:16:36.039 --> 00:16:37.799
made her feel secure.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.360
But she probably

00:16:40.519 --> 00:16:41.120
didn't know

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.080
that Zeng Jie was married.

00:16:43.559 --> 00:16:44.759
You're married?

00:16:45.039 --> 00:16:46.679
How could you lie to me?

00:16:48.879 --> 00:16:49.559
Very soon,

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.720
Wei discovered

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.399
that Zeng Jie was married.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.480
She was devastated.

00:16:53.799 --> 00:16:54.559
She probably fought

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.440
with Zeng Jie

00:16:55.639 --> 00:16:56.360
and said something

00:16:56.519 --> 00:16:57.000
threatening.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.399
I'm going to destroy you.

00:17:00.559 --> 00:17:01.120
I think

00:17:01.399 --> 00:17:03.080
Wei was just venting

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.000
her anger.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:04.799
She's seen

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:05.799
many liars before.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.000
But Zeng Jie got scared.

00:17:14.519 --> 00:17:16.079
Other bad guys may not be scared.

00:17:16.519 --> 00:17:17.559
But he is different.

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:19.039
He must keep his status

00:17:19.279 --> 00:17:20.279
and reputation.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.400
Besides, his wife comes
from a wealthy family.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.720
His art career

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.400
is funded

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.559
by his wife's family.

00:17:25.759 --> 00:17:26.480
He can't let

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.640
his affair with Wei

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.000
damage his reputation.

00:17:29.119 --> 00:17:30.559
He might have offered Wei

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.400
some money.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.519
Wei was furious

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.599
and turned him down.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.240
He was even more scared.

00:17:35.759 --> 00:17:36.240
What to do?

00:17:36.559 --> 00:17:37.160
What to do?

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.000
Then

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.680
rage surged from his heart.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.599
Evil intentions rose.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.599
(He killed Wei.)

00:17:59.799 --> 00:18:01.759
(Body disposal
is usually the trickiest.)

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:02.960
(But for Zeng Jie,)

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.720
(it was the easiest part.)

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:06.880
His kiln

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.400
could reduce everything to ashes.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.640
(But he still feared leaving traces)

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.440
(because Wei)

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:14.440
(must have left)

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.599
(so many traces)

00:18:15.759 --> 00:18:16.599
(in his studio.)

00:18:17.279 --> 00:18:18.200
(So soon after,)

00:18:18.559 --> 00:18:19.799
(he meticulously)

00:18:20.039 --> 00:18:21.400
(planned a fire)

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.160
(that burned his studio)

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.319
(to the ground.)

00:18:50.559 --> 00:18:51.359
I saw the report

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.279
on the fire.

00:18:52.319 --> 00:18:52.720
Yeah.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.240
Who'd believe that Master Zeng

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.039
would burn down his own studio

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.880
and destroy his own works?

00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:00.519
Think about what I just said.

00:19:01.319 --> 00:19:02.039
Doesn't it

00:19:02.519 --> 00:19:03.720
make sense?

00:19:08.079 --> 00:19:09.200
So you believe that is

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.079
the truth?

00:19:11.839 --> 00:19:13.079
At least, it aligns with

00:19:13.359 --> 00:19:14.240
the current outcome.

00:19:14.599 --> 00:19:15.119
I know...

00:19:15.559 --> 00:19:16.240
That's right.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.480
I have no evidence.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.680
Do you have any proof

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.519
that Wei

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.200
is safe and sound?

00:19:29.559 --> 00:19:30.200
Big Hui.

00:19:31.039 --> 00:19:32.160
Why didn't you notice

00:19:32.279 --> 00:19:33.359
that Liu Wei was missing

00:19:33.759 --> 00:19:34.880
and suddenly realize it

00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:36.200
after a year of your breakup?

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.559
A year.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.160
How am I supposed to find her now?

00:19:40.599 --> 00:19:41.240
Tell me.

00:19:41.359 --> 00:19:42.519
How can I help you now?

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.759
What's so funny?

00:19:51.119 --> 00:19:52.359
You finally believe me.

00:19:54.079 --> 00:19:55.279
I acknowledge your abilities.

00:20:02.079 --> 00:20:03.119
The department meeting

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.920
dragged on forever today.

00:20:06.519 --> 00:20:07.000
Did you eat?

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:08.519
Yeah.

00:20:09.039 --> 00:20:09.920
Office meals.

00:20:12.279 --> 00:20:12.799
You used to

00:20:12.839 --> 00:20:13.880
hate Western food.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.680
Why are you having these?

00:20:16.119 --> 00:20:16.880
Just for a change.

00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:18.200
It's convenient.

00:20:18.839 --> 00:20:20.400
Don't trouble yourself cooking.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:21.839
Should I

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.200
hire a cook

00:20:23.359 --> 00:20:23.920
tomorrow?

00:20:24.319 --> 00:20:25.039
I don't want

00:20:25.119 --> 00:20:26.200
strangers in the house.

00:20:27.799 --> 00:20:28.960
Are you leaving tonight?

00:20:31.839 --> 00:20:33.440
There's still a lot to do.

00:20:34.119 --> 00:20:35.400
Go back to work.

00:20:36.079 --> 00:20:38.319
I know you're under pressure.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.359
Alright.

00:20:42.799 --> 00:20:44.200
I'll grab some clothes

00:20:45.319 --> 00:20:46.480
and work overnight

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:47.720
at the studio.

00:20:51.599 --> 00:20:53.480
I'll rush through those orders

00:20:54.599 --> 00:20:56.160
and secure funds quickly

00:20:57.279 --> 00:20:58.960
to ease your parents' minds.

00:21:00.119 --> 00:21:01.160
Thanks, darling.

00:21:21.843 --> 00:21:25.024
(Newspaper)

00:21:50.359 --> 00:21:50.960
Go ahead.

00:21:52.039 --> 00:21:52.559
My buddy says

00:21:52.599 --> 00:21:53.880
you come almost every day

00:21:54.119 --> 00:21:54.839
and sit here.

00:21:55.079 --> 00:21:56.160
So I waited here.

00:21:56.559 --> 00:21:57.759
When you crossed the street,

00:21:57.839 --> 00:21:58.519
I started

00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.920
brewing this pot.

00:22:00.359 --> 00:22:00.920
It's perfect.

00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:01.839
Right now,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.279
the temperature's just right.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.720
Different coffee.

00:22:12.359 --> 00:22:13.559
I know you've got taste.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.240
It was Guatemalan-washed yesterday.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:15.839
This is

00:22:15.839 --> 00:22:16.960
Costa Rican Natural

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.799
blended with
Panama Esmeralda Green Label.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.119
A taste of sunshine.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.440
I made it for you.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.200
You think I'm like sunshine?

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:23.759
Of course.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.680
Absolutely.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.640
Anything else to say

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:28.960
apart from that?

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.240
I meant to

00:22:30.319 --> 00:22:31.200
apologize for

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:31.880
what I did.

00:22:32.119 --> 00:22:33.200
But I thought about it.

00:22:33.559 --> 00:22:34.240
You were right.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.319
If I apologize,

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.359
it implies that

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.440
I find you abnormal.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.200
So I just want to treat you

00:22:39.359 --> 00:22:40.200
to coffee.

00:22:40.759 --> 00:22:41.839
I'm having the coffee.

00:22:42.079 --> 00:22:42.519
Please,

00:22:42.759 --> 00:22:43.799
no more QR codes.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:44.599
Rejecting others

00:22:44.799 --> 00:22:46.160
isn't a pleasant thing.

00:22:46.559 --> 00:22:47.119
Can we

00:22:47.319 --> 00:22:47.960
just talk?

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.279
I don't want to talk,

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.559
but I did drink your coffee.

00:22:55.519 --> 00:22:56.759
I won't be embarrassed.

00:22:57.119 --> 00:22:58.079
If you want to stop,

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.079
just grab the water,

00:22:59.119 --> 00:22:59.880
and I'll leave.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:03.519
Let's talk.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.279
I can introduce you

00:23:08.599 --> 00:23:09.880
to many traditional

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.240
Chinese medicine doctors.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.599
Don't!

00:23:13.839 --> 00:23:15.000
Let's change the subject.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:20.920
You're quite wealthy.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:21.880
I bet you've

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:22.839
seen many doctors.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.200
How am I wealthy?

00:23:26.079 --> 00:23:27.920
Diamond bracelet, diamond earrings,

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.759
leather bag,

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:29.839
and designer clothes.

00:23:30.119 --> 00:23:31.400
I don't know your perfume,

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.960
but it must be high-end.

00:23:33.039 --> 00:23:34.079
Your wheelchair is auto.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.680
Sapphires on the watch yesterday.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:36.599
Diamonds on this one.

00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:37.680
So observant.

00:23:38.319 --> 00:23:39.104
Occupational habit.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.279
But you don't

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.119
look like a luxury store salesperson.

00:23:43.559 --> 00:23:44.519
You must come from

00:23:44.519 --> 00:23:46.160
a wealthy family. You enjoy reading.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.079
This coffee shop

00:23:47.359 --> 00:23:49.000
isn't far from the universities.

00:23:49.079 --> 00:23:49.960
Your parents must be

00:23:50.119 --> 00:23:50.720
educated.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:51.559
For example,

00:23:51.759 --> 00:23:53.640
a businessman father
and a teacher mother.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.039
Can't I rely on my looks

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.319
to find a rich man?

00:23:56.559 --> 00:23:57.839
That guy's preference must be

00:23:58.039 --> 00:23:58.759
rather unusual.

00:23:58.839 --> 00:23:59.839
Why did you hit on me?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:00.640
I didn't.

00:24:00.759 --> 00:24:01.559
Say that again.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:03.880
I don't know either.

00:24:04.079 --> 00:24:04.880
I...

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.359
I just feel

00:24:06.359 --> 00:24:07.559
that you're different.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.039
You have unusual preferences?

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:09.839
Not at all.

00:24:10.079 --> 00:24:10.880
I didn't even notice

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:11.799
when I hit on you...

00:24:11.799 --> 00:24:12.279
See?

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.279
You admit that you hit on me.

00:24:16.519 --> 00:24:17.119
I really like

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.079
your personality.

00:24:18.359 --> 00:24:18.920
So positive.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.400
I'm not positive.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.480
Not one bit.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:24.799
If you were sitting

00:24:24.799 --> 00:24:25.480
in a wheelchair,

00:24:26.039 --> 00:24:27.640
you wouldn't be positive either.

00:24:31.079 --> 00:24:33.279
Will you ever recover?

00:24:33.599 --> 00:24:35.559
Or are you recovering now?

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:48.759
By the way,

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.319
what do you do?

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:51.720
I'm unemployed.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.319
Seeing a rich lady like you,

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.440
I thought

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.440
I'd give it a try.

00:24:56.079 --> 00:24:56.640
Really?

00:24:57.079 --> 00:24:57.680
Pretty much.

00:24:57.799 --> 00:24:58.799
I'm a video content

00:24:59.039 --> 00:24:59.839
creator.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.160
What kind of videos?

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.799
Mystery case analysis.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:03.599
Check it out

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.559
if you have time.

00:25:04.759 --> 00:25:06.400
The Logic Behind Truth.

00:25:11.759 --> 00:25:12.519
Want some dessert?

00:25:13.039 --> 00:25:13.799
Blueberry mousse.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:14.720
Charge it

00:25:15.039 --> 00:25:15.680
to my card.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.359
You don't have a card.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.680
I'll get one

00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:20.119
next time.

00:25:23.156 --> 00:25:27.098
(Logic Behind the Truth)

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.680
We all seek the truth.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.519
Truth always hides deep.

00:25:30.839 --> 00:25:32.119
Only by clarifying the logic

00:25:32.279 --> 00:25:32.799
can we obtain

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:33.640
the truth.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.000
Hello,

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.240
welcome to

00:25:36.359 --> 00:25:38.119
this episode of The Logic Behind Truth.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:39.680
I'm your old friend.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.519
Big Hui.

00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:42.480
Today, we're going to talk about

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.160
the adhesive tape serial murder
in Country A.

00:25:46.759 --> 00:25:47.000
Hello.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.279
I need to work

00:25:48.599 --> 00:25:49.559
overtime today.

00:25:50.119 --> 00:25:51.680
Are you fine staying home alone?

00:25:52.319 --> 00:25:53.480
I'm fine, don't worry.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:54.799
Don't stay up too late.

00:25:55.119 --> 00:25:56.160
Get some rest.

00:25:56.736 --> 00:25:58.154
(Zeng Jie)

00:25:59.359 --> 00:25:59.960
Here,

00:26:00.119 --> 00:26:01.000
I won't discuss

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.039
whether the death penalty
should be retained.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.000
I just can't accept the fact

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.400
that scum like this

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.960
can't be restrained by morality,

00:26:09.319 --> 00:26:10.680
and not even the law.

00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:12.319
But I'm just

00:26:12.559 --> 00:26:13.839
an ordinary video creator.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.920
I can't make scum repent,

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.319
nor can I help

00:26:17.319 --> 00:26:19.039
those who've been hurt.

00:26:20.359 --> 00:26:21.440
All I can do

00:26:21.839 --> 00:26:23.359
is to make quality content,

00:26:24.039 --> 00:26:26.400
hoping for a more harmonious world.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.119
Why are you silent?

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.839
I'm thinking what to order.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:36.720
Troubled?

00:26:37.039 --> 00:26:37.559
No.

00:26:38.559 --> 00:26:39.160
Really?

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.799
Actually, I want to...

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:50.359
End this?

00:26:56.759 --> 00:26:58.079
Last time we met,

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.039
you'd moved

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:02.640
to a modest but nice apartment.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.759
Last month, you mentioned

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:05.759
running for

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.400
project team leader.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.240
So, you made it.

00:27:10.079 --> 00:27:10.759
Congratulations.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.240
Aren't you upset?

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.000
Watching you improve yourself,

00:27:15.359 --> 00:27:16.279
how could I be upset?

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.559
It's just a pity.

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.839
You said it would take us two years

00:27:24.839 --> 00:27:26.920
to try a new restaurant

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.599
each month.

00:27:30.039 --> 00:27:30.519
There are

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.680
so many places left.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:33.640
Professor Zeng,

00:27:34.839 --> 00:27:36.240
thank you for helping me,

00:27:36.559 --> 00:27:38.160
and for all your encouragement.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:39.680
Having

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.759
a remarkable man like you

00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:41.440
by my side

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:41.960
pushed me

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.200
to work harder.

00:27:45.039 --> 00:27:48.599
But right now,

00:27:49.559 --> 00:27:51.039
I can't commit to anyone.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:53.839
(Money transfer)
And those

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.160
restaurants we missed,

00:27:55.799 --> 00:27:57.039
I've sent you the list.

00:27:57.559 --> 00:27:59.559
Today is September 27,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.279
2019.

00:28:02.319 --> 00:28:03.599
I'll always remember this day.

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:04.480
Okay.

00:28:05.519 --> 00:28:07.680
Let's cherish today then.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.839
I respect your choice,

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.559
though it pains me.

00:28:22.759 --> 00:28:23.640
And

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.039
I'll miss you terribly.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.279
Thank you for your respect.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.279
This is goodbye.

00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:33.880
Please don't.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.240
Please don't.

00:28:56.371 --> 00:28:58.171
(Payment received)

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.039
Coincidental.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.559
I'm here almost every day,

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.880
usually sitting here.

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.279
Not that coincidental.

00:29:25.359 --> 00:29:26.079
Want a coffee?

00:29:27.359 --> 00:29:28.440
Can I ask you something?

00:29:28.839 --> 00:29:29.799
You mentioned

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.240
your friend's escape room.

00:29:31.279 --> 00:29:32.240
Do I have to

00:29:32.319 --> 00:29:33.240
go up and down there?

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:34.960
I should advise my friend

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.720
to develop

00:29:36.799 --> 00:29:37.519
a low-physical

00:29:37.599 --> 00:29:39.079
escape room concept.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.279
Then can I go camping

00:29:41.759 --> 00:29:43.440
without capable legs?

00:29:43.759 --> 00:29:44.519
Absolutely.

00:29:44.559 --> 00:29:45.119
I will

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.240
take care of you.

00:29:47.119 --> 00:29:48.640
I haven't been outdoors in ages.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:49.920
When do you want to go?

00:29:50.359 --> 00:29:51.039
Today.

00:29:52.039 --> 00:29:52.680
So soon?

00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:53.759
Never mind.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.000
Let's go.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:56.440
We're off.

00:29:57.359 --> 00:29:58.039
Wait.

00:29:59.119 --> 00:30:00.839
Change into this first.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.720
What's this about?

00:30:04.359 --> 00:30:05.559
I'm a married woman

00:30:05.559 --> 00:30:06.839
with distinctive features.

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.839
If my husband found out

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.440
I went camping with you,

00:30:10.799 --> 00:30:11.559
it would be

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:12.640
awkward.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.080
I don't mind explaining.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:14.880
But people

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:15.839
prefer gossip

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.200
over explanations.

00:30:17.359 --> 00:30:18.160
I thought

00:30:18.279 --> 00:30:19.279
I had nothing to hide.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.079
But now I suddenly

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.000
feel a bit guilty.

00:30:23.519 --> 00:30:24.039
Well then,

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.160
let me satisfy

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.079
your curiosity as compensation.

00:30:28.039 --> 00:30:28.720
I lost my legs

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.119
in a car accident last year.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:33.480
Car accident?

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:34.680
I drove into

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.119
a roadside ditch.

00:30:37.119 --> 00:30:38.319
I wasn't a bad driver.

00:30:38.799 --> 00:30:39.839
The brakes

00:30:40.079 --> 00:30:41.480
suddenly failed.

00:30:44.839 --> 00:30:46.039
Are you sure...?

00:30:46.279 --> 00:30:47.599
I'm sure I didn't press the gas.

00:30:47.839 --> 00:30:48.680
Yeah.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.079
And I'm sure

00:30:50.079 --> 00:30:51.799
you're not some terrifying road menace.

00:30:53.519 --> 00:30:56.119
(Little Fairy)
(It was one afternoon a year ago.)

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.759
Why are you going there alone?

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.119
Where is your husband?

00:31:00.359 --> 00:31:01.240
He's busy.

00:31:01.599 --> 00:31:02.960
I finally found a master to pray

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:03.960
for my father.

00:31:04.279 --> 00:31:04.839
I can't wait

00:31:05.079 --> 00:31:06.279
for my husband to finish work.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.519
But he helped

00:31:07.599 --> 00:31:08.400
service my car

00:31:08.599 --> 00:31:09.480
yesterday.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.759
When will you be back?

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.680
It's just over an hour's drive.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.160
What's wrong?

00:31:19.039 --> 00:31:20.720
Why isn't the brake responding?

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:22.240
No way.

00:31:23.039 --> 00:31:23.920
Wrong pedal?

00:31:24.119 --> 00:31:25.599
No way. It's not responding.

00:31:27.799 --> 00:31:29.000
Can you slow down now?

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:29.799
What do I do?

00:31:30.079 --> 00:31:31.079
I'm going too fast.

00:31:31.559 --> 00:31:32.279
Stay calm.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.880
I'll find someone to help.

00:31:34.119 --> 00:31:35.279
How do I stop?

00:31:41.039 --> 00:31:41.680
Theoretically,

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.240
I could still recover.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.519
But only theoretically.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:45.759
In reality,

00:31:46.079 --> 00:31:47.440
I've accepted the fact that

00:31:47.599 --> 00:31:48.920
I'll remain like this forever.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.039
Don't pity me,

00:31:53.359 --> 00:31:54.440
or feel awkward.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.119
I admire your optimistic spirit...

00:31:57.119 --> 00:31:57.960
Big Hui.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.160
Stop faking sincerity.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.640
It's painfully fake.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.359
I'll get changed first.

00:32:19.319 --> 00:32:19.880
Try this.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.319
Which agency are you from?

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.640
W-What agency?

00:32:30.079 --> 00:32:30.759
You look

00:32:30.759 --> 00:32:32.119
very attentive.

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.359
You even make coffee.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:34.759
So I want to ask

00:32:34.839 --> 00:32:35.759
your monthly rate.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:37.920
I'm sorry.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.720
I'm her permanent hire.

00:32:43.759 --> 00:32:44.839
So clueless.

00:32:49.559 --> 00:32:50.920
Is camping so popular now?

00:32:51.279 --> 00:32:52.599
This is a popular spot

00:32:52.839 --> 00:32:53.640
for casual trips.

00:32:53.839 --> 00:32:55.319
With some proper preparation,

00:32:55.359 --> 00:32:56.000
we could go

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:56.839
somewhere wilder

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.200
and set up a tent.

00:32:58.599 --> 00:33:00.200
I'll go around in my wheelchair?

00:33:00.359 --> 00:33:00.880
No worries.

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:01.839
Most paths are

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:02.960
wheelchair accessible.

00:33:03.319 --> 00:33:03.880
If not,

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:04.720
I'll carry you.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.079
Don't bother.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:07.400
I can't

00:33:07.519 --> 00:33:08.680
do anything like this.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.240
I hate burdening others.

00:33:10.519 --> 00:33:11.440
Don't say that.

00:33:11.559 --> 00:33:12.240
There's plenty

00:33:12.319 --> 00:33:13.319
you can do.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.440
Like what?

00:33:15.079 --> 00:33:16.160
Ever watched live streams?

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:17.799
Wheelchair streamers

00:33:17.799 --> 00:33:19.319
are new to the industry.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.039
Disabled people?

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:21.960
No.

00:33:22.039 --> 00:33:23.200
They just sit at computers

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.720
like they're in wheelchairs.

00:33:25.319 --> 00:33:26.880
You want me to play the victim?

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.119
That's outdated.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.359
Now everyone is

00:33:29.519 --> 00:33:30.519
putting on a tough front.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:31.720
Do you play games?

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:32.519
You're pretty.

00:33:32.519 --> 00:33:33.240
Just don't mention

00:33:33.519 --> 00:33:34.640
that you're married.

00:33:34.799 --> 00:33:36.200
You'll get plenty of fans.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.319
I'm bad at games.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.680
It doesn't matter.

00:33:39.759 --> 00:33:40.400
Practice

00:33:40.559 --> 00:33:41.440
makes perfect.

00:33:44.119 --> 00:33:45.839
Is your ex-girlfriend also a streamer?

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:47.680
Yeah.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.039
She did livestreams

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:49.799
and made videos.

00:33:50.119 --> 00:33:51.200
Is she good-looking?

00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:52.079
Got any photos?

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.000
We dated briefly last year.

00:34:00.119 --> 00:34:01.440
Then she dumped me.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.320
So pretty. Why did she dump you?

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:12.280
You weren't good enough?

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.159
I don't deserve her.

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.119
She's young and beautiful,

00:34:16.119 --> 00:34:17.199
ambitious and proud too.

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:18.199
An ordinary guy like me

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:19.239
is not good enough.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.559
Still thinking about her?

00:34:23.039 --> 00:34:23.960
Not at all.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.480
But recently, I think

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:27.840
she's gone missing.

00:34:29.599 --> 00:34:30.519
She blocked you?

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:32.719
That's normal.

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.320
But she has vanished.

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:36.840
No trace left anywhere.

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:38.199
It's like

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:39.519
she's been erased

00:34:39.559 --> 00:34:40.400
from the world.

00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:47.880
Big Hui.

00:34:48.599 --> 00:34:49.519
You've broken up.

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:50.559
So, just let it go.

00:35:06.039 --> 00:35:06.960
100,000 deposit.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.159
You'll have remaining 200,000
after completion.

00:35:12.119 --> 00:35:13.440
You're very pretty.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.840
You're so pretty

00:35:16.079 --> 00:35:17.199
with such elegance.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.519
Why is your husband cheating on you?

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:21.800
Sis.

00:35:23.159 --> 00:35:24.800
Are you cheating on him?

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.239
Still want the money?

00:35:28.199 --> 00:35:29.480
Just making conversation.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.559
Please don't mind me.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:32.400
Sis.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.280
I mind it.

00:35:35.199 --> 00:35:36.400
If you want the money,

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.599
just do your job.

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:38.960
Less chatter.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.639
Rest assured.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.400
I'll do my job properly.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:57.679
You have a boyfriend, right?

00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:59.119
It doesn't matter.

00:35:59.639 --> 00:36:00.519
I can cut him loose.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.119
It wasn't serious anyway.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.239
If he had any money,

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.559
would I be doing this for you?

00:36:08.079 --> 00:36:09.599
Your boyfriend is pitiful.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:10.840
How is he pitiful?

00:36:11.159 --> 00:36:12.360
Being with me

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.760
was his karmic reward from past lives.

00:36:15.239 --> 00:36:16.719
But your husband is luckier.

00:36:17.719 --> 00:36:18.960
He has a beautiful wife

00:36:19.559 --> 00:36:21.159
and still gets to date me.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.119
My girlfriend

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.719
is accompanying a top streamer

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.000
and made me tag along.

00:36:52.864 --> 00:36:55.009
Wait a second.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.865
I learned coffee-making with him.

00:37:03.651 --> 00:37:05.408
I learned it...

00:37:06.069 --> 00:37:06.720
Sorry, one more.

00:37:07.264 --> 00:37:08.704
I learned coffee-making with him.

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:10.880
I learned it...

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.799
Sorry, one more.

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:14.522
Did you tell her

00:37:15.091 --> 00:37:16.643
you're looking for your ex-girlfriend?

00:37:20.532 --> 00:37:21.950
There's another line, right?

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:23.552
Yeah.

00:37:24.512 --> 00:37:26.553
Nothing about feelings.

00:37:27.155 --> 00:37:27.680
Alright.

00:37:28.115 --> 00:37:29.635
Sorry, I have another line.

00:37:29.876 --> 00:37:31.520
Nothing about feelings. Then what?

00:37:34.131 --> 00:37:36.756
♪All that I want is what I need♪

00:37:40.403 --> 00:37:44.019

Move forward.

00:37:48.756 --> 00:37:49.206
Again.

00:37:54.336 --> 00:37:58.368
Move your feet more.
Struggle more intensely.

00:37:58.368 --> 00:37:59.072
Okay.

00:38:05.427 --> 00:38:06.304
Cut.

00:38:07.604 --> 00:38:09.201

Huh?

00:38:19.764 --> 00:38:22.528
I have a friend who runs...

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:24.160
What was it again?

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.356
Caution: Reversing vehicle.

00:38:26.035 --> 00:38:28.192
Don't bother. I got this.

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:30.793

Don't play the silent cool guy.

00:38:39.104 --> 00:38:41.088
Just listen to me.

00:38:41.459 --> 00:38:43.819
Point out anything
that doesn't make sense.

00:38:46.963 --> 00:38:48.192
Sorry, let's do it again.

00:38:48.468 --> 00:38:52.259
She fell for Zeng Jie when they met.

00:38:52.992 --> 00:38:55.096
I can't see at all. It's useless.

00:38:55.155 --> 00:38:56.992
She fell for him and...

00:38:56.992 --> 00:38:58.159
What a shock.

00:38:58.176 --> 00:39:01.376
Who'd think that Master Zeng
would burn down his own studio

00:39:01.396 --> 00:39:03.390
and destroy his own works?

00:39:05.555 --> 00:39:06.752
Sorry, let me read it.

00:39:06.752 --> 00:39:07.537
Go ahead.

00:39:08.211 --> 00:39:09.472
