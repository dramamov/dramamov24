Yu is my sister.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.860
She is the pearl of our family.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.860
What I choose

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.780
is not important.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.140
Linyang.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.260
Linyang.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.340
Being too cautious

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.720
and hiding everything in your heart

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.420
is not always a good thing.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.340
General Chu,

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.880
you have to tear it apart to start over.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.700
Here's my advice in return.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.860
Though Yao Yong is dead,

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.740
North Qi will still make a move.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.740
I do have concerns in my heart,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.900
but I will never be melancholic.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.040
Please pay more attention

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.540
to the investigation.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.900
I will inform you immediately

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.100
of any movement
from the enemy at the border.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.140
Thank you, Young Marquis.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.420
Linyang!

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.220
Too cautious?

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.380
General Chu,

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.820
are you really not going to see her?

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:25.780
No.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.340
When I first let her

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.540
help me recover,

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.500
it was also to return a favor

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.020
on Yu's behalf.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.020
Now, everything is settled.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.700
She's too young

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.060
to waste time

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.660
on someone like me.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.100
If you really think so,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.620
when Miss Song first visited you

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.540
and took your pulse,

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.180
you'd already repaid the favor.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.700
It seems

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.580
you have been quite idle lately.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.140
I take my leave.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.500
Linyang,

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.140
you can shut me out,

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.340
but you have to tell me

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.380
the real reason.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.540
If I don't see you today,

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.460
I will come tomorrow,

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.260
the day after, and every day after that,

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.260
until I hear an answer

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.100
from you.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.900
I know you can hear me,

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.020
Linyang.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.420
Do you really not want to talk to me?

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.620
- What's going on?
- What happened?

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.540
Such a beautiful girl.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.640
Why is she squatting here?

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.400
What are you looking at?

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.740
Am I that handsome?

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.300
Leave now.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.360
- Leave.
- Stop looking.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.320
Let's go.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.300
Tuantuan.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.180
Have you been shut out by General Chu

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.780
every time you came these days?

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.540
Tuantuan,

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.380
don't be sad.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.700
Feelings are

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.020
always unclear and confusing.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.300
I understand you.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.540
Wenchang.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.140
I understand.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.060
What a pair of unfortunate siblings,

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.780
both falling for the Chu siblings.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.460
Chu Linyang,

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.140
how could you

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.960
not appreciate Tuantuan's affection

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.160
and act so aloof instead?

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.560
Wenchang,

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.820
you can't speak ill of Linyang.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.060
I...

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.540
I was just scolding him for you.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.820
Still, you can't do that.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.260
Who are you scolding?

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.180
Jin.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.300
Go ahead; I'll look after Tuantuan.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.340
Jin!

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:58.780
Come on, Tuantuan.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.100
Let's go back.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.220
Come on.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:18.740
Jin, Jin.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:19.780
I know.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.940
I know I should've discussed it with you

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:22.620
before I left.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.900
But I can't spend my whole life

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.940
being a good-for-nothing.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.220
Shilan is right.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.660
I've always disliked others

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.020
changing me,

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.800
so how can I expect others

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.640
to change for me?

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.180
But I like you, Jin.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.420
I want to be the man

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.580
you can be proud of.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.340
I don't want to live my life

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.420
in a muddled way anymore.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.380
I want to be like Yun

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.040
and earn military merits

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.400
and bring glory to my family.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.980
I want to contribute my strength

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.600
to the great cause of Great Sui.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.740
I want you to live a life of abundance

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.700
after marrying me,

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.340
above all the ladies

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.340
in Huajing.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.700
I want you to be

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.560
the most envied lady in Huajing.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.940
But I also

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.140
understand your thoughts.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.120
If I go to the battlefield,

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.380
you will live

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.580
in constant worry for me.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.140
These worries...

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.300
Why did you say all that?

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.220
Do you agree to part ways or not?

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.260
Of course, I don't agree.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:26.820
In Dingfeng Valley,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.860
I helped your sister capture the rebels

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.100
and save the displaced people.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.320
I realized for the first time

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.140
that my hands can help Great Sui

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.220
and the commoners

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.680
and do something useful.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.480
This is a feeling I've never had before,

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.700
and I really like it.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:42.980
So,

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.700
I'm sorry, Jin.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.840
If the same thing happens again,

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:49.980
I will still go.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.580
In that case,

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.700
let's take a break for a while.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.420
Bye.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.020
Other people's fireworks

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.180
look so beautiful.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:11.940
Why don't we have some?

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.020
Lingchun.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.080
At this time of year in the past,

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.020
our family would be busy

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.140
with sacrifices and prayers.

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:36.260
Usually,

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.740
these tasks are done by the servants,

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:39.180
but today,

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:40.780
we have to do everything.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:41.820
Yes.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.780
Today is a day to pray

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.660
for a good harvest next year.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.180
I remember every year around this time,

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.860
Wei Rong would pester me to play Dou Cao

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:50.700
and sing songs.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.260
He sang so badly,

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.620
yet he sang especially loudly.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:54.860
I remember that.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.260
When Rong sang a love song

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.100
with you,

00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.300
your face turned red

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.540
as soon as he opened his mouth.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:01.740
Chun...

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:02.740
Chun, Lan.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.220
Let's start eating.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.180
Alright, let's eat.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.140
Uncle,

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.500
hasn't Auntie changed

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.380
into her new clothes yet?

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.900
Why hasn't she come out?

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:19.980
Uncle,

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.860
Auntie hasn't finished

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.500
telling me that story.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.700
I miss her.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.260
Can you take me to find her?

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:30.580
Lingling,

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.780
your auntie is at her home now.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.260
She'll tell you the story later, okay?

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.400
No, no.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.060
I want to see Auntie now.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:42.620
Alright.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:44.820
I will take you

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.660
to see her now.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:48.700
Yun?

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.340
Chun,

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.420
Lan,

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.640
I'll take Lingling to the Chu Mansion

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:54.820
and come back later.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.300
Come on.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:09:59.820
You start eating.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.260
With Yu by her side,

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.660
Lingling rarely mentions

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:11.980
Qin and Han.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:16.460
Let's eat.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.020
Come on, Lingchun.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:18.860
Here.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.660
(Eldest Princess's Mansion)

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.040
Today, I went to the Imperial Temple

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.140
with His Majesty for prayers.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.180
It has exhausted me.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.820
My headache

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:51.820
is acting up again.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.140
Hanmei,

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.220
the effect of this medicine

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:56.620
is not as good as before.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:00.880
There is a stronger medicine

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.020
coming up.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.260
Then bring it to me now.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:05.500
This way, please.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.540
Indeed, it is a strong medicine.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.140
My headache is gone instantly.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.780
It seems I was right.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.880
You've been distracted lately,

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.140
partly because you were worried

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.540
about the safety of Ms. Chu.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:29.780
Well done.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:38.940
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.020
Mr. Xue sent someone to fetch me,

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.060
so I guessed

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.500
that you must be missing me.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.380
I've brought some little trinkets.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:49.700
I hope you won't mind.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.140
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.140
You are truly

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.380
most amusing.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:07.860
I would love for you

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.260
to stay here every day.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.380
When you went missing,

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.860
I was so worried

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:13.980
that I couldn't sleep well.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:15.860
Now that you are safe,

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:16.980
I can finally have

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:18.580
a good night's sleep.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.580
Thank you for your concern.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.680
Your Highness,
with Ms. Chu by your side,

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.020
I'll take my leave.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:34.820
Before I go, please accept

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.140
this healing medicine, Ms. Chu.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:37.360
For the sake

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.300
of the Eldest Princess,

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.340
do not get hurt again.

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:45.780
Thank you.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.380
Mr. Xue asked me to come

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.100
to entertain the Eldest Princess,

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:54.740
but now it seems

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.740
that I am the one being left out.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:03.980
I am just worried

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.180
that if the bandits

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.020
who pursued you

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.360
are the same ones

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.700
who attacked the Eldest Princess,

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:11.220
then the Eldest Princess
will still be in danger.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.060
Have those bandits

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.580
been captured?

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.100
Is there no clue at all?

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.260
I have lived in North Qi before.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.300
If there is anything I can help with,

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.460
please do not hesitate to ask.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.100
- Thanks.
- There is no need

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.300
for you to worry too much.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.420
I am more than capable

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:37.420
of protecting you all.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.340
I'll take my leave.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:56.980
Tell me.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:58.740
What happened?

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.140
It has been a close call.

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:12.900
I hope my visit

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.180
didn't disturb your rest.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.180
Seeing you,

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.220
I don't need to rest.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:24.020
By the way,

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.020
would you like to see something?

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.180
What new toy is it?

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:44.620
The evidence found in Qinxi Valley.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:46.400
Isn't that interesting?

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.990
(15 supply carts sent by General Yao)

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.820
(20 spies have been sent into Great Sui)

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.420
Why are you so clumsy today?

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:00.980
I slipped for a moment.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:02.540
Please forgive me.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.380
After the auction banquet,

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.660
Qinxi Valley has been sealed off.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.180
So, the evidence left inside

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:24.620
(20 spies)
has not been destroyed.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:25.740
After Mr. Gu

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:26.580
found this evidence,

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:28.100
he left Qinxi Valley with it

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:29.700
and was immediately pursued.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:31.460
It is evident

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.780
that the other party was waiting

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:33.920
for someone to bring it out

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:34.660
and eliminate them.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:39.780
Have you thought of anything?

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.460
I have pondered for a long time.

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.660
What does the pattern

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:54.540
on it mean?

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:57.380
Is it some kind of code?

00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:58.740
Or is it...?

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:05.660
For the time being,

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.620
I also can't figure it out.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:09.760
Leave

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.020
this evidence here with me.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.020
As soon as I remember,

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:14.900
I will tell you immediately.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:17.460
Thanks, Your Highness.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:29.580
Chu Yu,

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:32.660
life is short

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:34.380
and fleeting.

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:36.860
I believe

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.540
that when love is intense,

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.420
it is like a moth flying into the flame.

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.180
I have always thought

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.660
that you and I are alike.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:46.620
When people like us

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.540
fall for someone,

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:51.540
we should be brave.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.260
Don't wait until it becomes a memory

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.220
and leave yourself with regrets.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.300
I will block the gossip.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:09.540
I will brave the dangers.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:12.540
I will fill the wounds

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:15.260
in your heart.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:18.580
I will give you

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.340
what you have lost,

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:24.480
what you have never gained,

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:28.760
and what you want to possess.

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:35.940
I used to think

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:37.380
that liking someone

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:39.380
was reckless, like a moth

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:40.800
flying into the flame.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:42.700
But now,

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:44.700
I am a bit hesitant.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.460
However, your words just now

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.300
have enlightened me a lot.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:17:59.820
I also hope that you

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.180
can fulfill your wishes.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.300
Your Highness, it is time to rest.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:18.480
What's wrong with you today?

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.180
You seem so nervous.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:22.180
I have never seen you

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.460
make such a mistake before.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.100
I...

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.380
I've just been a bit tired lately

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:29.820
and haven't rested well.

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:31.940
Please punish me, Your Highness.

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.260
(In this mansion,)

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.300
(how many people are loyal,)

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.300
(and how many are not?)

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:53.540
(Time to get an answer.)

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:23.380
I have always thought

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:24.740
that you and I are alike.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.740
When people like us

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:29.420
fall for someone,

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.140
we should be brave.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.380
Don't wait until it becomes a memory

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.460
and leave yourself with regrets.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:55.780
Yu.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.020
I'm here to take you home.

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.740
Auntie, let's go home.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:13.700
Lingling,

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.260
let me take you to buy fireworks,

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.100
okay?

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:50.660
Why stare at me?

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.560
Aren't you supposed to be
at the Chu Mansion?

00:20:58.940 --> 00:20:59.780
Why did you come out?

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:01.700
What about you?

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.060
Why are you also out?

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:09.560
Lingling is missing you.

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.980
Is Lingling the only one?

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:23.980
Me, too.

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:26.420
I'm missing you, too.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:33.900
I'm missing you, too.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:47.740
Actually, after I came back that day,

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:50.860
I was really scared.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.460
I was afraid that you'd tell me

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.140
everything in the village was fake,

00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.100
so I went to your house with gifts

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:01.580
just to ask you

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:04.700
when you would come home.

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:10.960
But you didn't tell me

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:13.620
and even avoided me.

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.420
I couldn't press further,

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:22.540
so I could only wait here.

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.220
What if I never showed up?

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:30.860
I could go to you,

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:33.860
but I would rather

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:36.540
you came to me.

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:43.260
You're so invincible on the battlefield,

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:45.140
yet you're afraid now?

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.020
Yes, I'm afraid.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:48.540
I...

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:50.540
I really am.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:06.780
Don't be afraid.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.140
I'm back.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:19.580
I finally brought you back.

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.700
If only every Sheri Festival

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:26.420
could be as lively

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.260
as today.

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:29.900
With us here,

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:31.380
it will be.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:36.320
I've been keeping an eye on Shen You.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:37.620
Lately,

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.380
he has been staying put.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:41.980
Then let's see

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.660
who has more patience.

00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:00.060
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:03.180
(Duke of Ning's Mansion)

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:14.680
Duke of Ning, you needed me?

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:23.180
Mr. Gu,

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:25.300
you are so busy these days.

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.300
It's harder for me to see you

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.700
than to see the Emperor.

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:30.500
Shouldn't you give me

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:31.340
an explanation?

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.540
If there is any misconduct

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:48.380
in my official conduct,

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:49.620
the Censorate will deal with me.

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:51.740
No need for you to worry.

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:58.300
Gu Chusheng,

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:00.540
have you forgotten

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:02.940
who provided the ladder

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:03.940
that you stepped on

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.780
to climb to your current position?

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:11.880
All that you have achieved today

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.280
is due to my patronage.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:14.860
Instead of being grateful,

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.420
you have been helping

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.340
my political rivals.

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:18.820
You helped

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.020
the Wei family rise again

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.340
and clear the name

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:22.420
of the Chu family.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.020
You seem to have a poor memory.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:29.280
It was you who forced me

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:31.700
to step on that ladder.

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:32.700
You...

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:35.620
As a disciple of the Emperor,

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:37.700
my duty is to seek justice

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:38.540
for the people.

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.940
Why are you so angry?

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.500
Did I do something wrong?

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:47.500
How dare you!

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.940
When you used to disobey me,

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:57.920
I thought I had taken in

00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:58.980
a useless lackey.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.220
But as it turns out,

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:03.500
you are an ingrate

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.460
with poor memory.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:09.460
I could've sent you

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.020
to hell back then;

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.260
so can I now.

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:28.780
I have been forced by you all

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.220
to be a bad person,

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:34.000
but I still want to be a good official.

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.100
Ever since I married your daughter,

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:40.900
I've only seen

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:41.840
a cowardly Duke of Ning,

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:43.980
who shirks responsibility

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.620
and can't tell right from wrong.

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:49.340
Even His Majesty has said

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.180
that three cities of ours are now

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.260
in the hands of North Qi,

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:55.540
and if we hastily seek peace,

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:57.500
we will only lose more.

00:27:58.700 --> 00:27:59.540
But you...

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.020
You are only afraid of war,

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.060
afraid of losing,

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:05.020
afraid of our continued defeat,

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.700
and afraid of dying in Huajing.

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:09.300
However,

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:11.780
no personal grudges

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.060
should stand in the way of justice.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:17.660
Besides,

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:19.580
do you not know

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.380
why I was assassinated?

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.220
If you want to die,

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:29.820
then so be it.

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:32.020
I'll kill you again.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:35.380
Father!

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:37.380
Get out of the way.

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:39.700
What are you doing?

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:40.860
Let me kill

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:42.020
this ungrateful man.

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:43.660
- Father.
- Move!

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:47.020
Father,

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:49.260
you always despise these warriors,

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:50.980
but now you are resorting

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:51.900
to violence at home.

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:55.100
You want to kill Gu, right?

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.060
Fine.

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:02.820
Kill me first.

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:21.860
Father!

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:31.220
What are you doing?

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:34.980
I want to divorce

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:36.700
Gu Chusheng.

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:40.700
Divorce?

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:45.540
Do you know

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:46.700
what divorce means to you?

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:53.780
Have you forgotten

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:54.820
how hard we worked

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:55.860
to make him

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.540
your husband?

00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:58.780
Father,

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:02.860
he isn't leaving me;

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:06.700
I'm leaving him.

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:11.400
The snow lotus on the mountain
is beautiful,

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:13.740
but once you pick it,

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.460
it's just ordinary.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.340
I'm tired of it.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.540
I want to drive him away from me.

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:27.380
But Father,

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:30.340
if you destroy Gu now,

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.980
when people talk about me,

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.460
they'll say I married

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:37.460
someone unworthy.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.940
I always want the best of everything.

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:43.460
Even in divorce,

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:45.460
Gu Chusheng

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:48.220
must be someone respectable.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:50.880
Don't you think so, Father?

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.100
Once

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:56.020
he leaves here today,

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:57.980
he will be our enemy.

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:00.580
I will show no mercy.

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.020
Think carefully.

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:09.500
I've made up my mind.

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:12.500
With his abilities,

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:14.980
he is not a match

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:18.020
for our family.

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:19.700
He won't amount

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:21.940
to much even after the divorce.

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:26.780
Gu Chusheng,

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:28.620
for Linlang's sake,

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:31.580
I will spare your life today.

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:49.580
Wipe it off.

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:51.700
Consider it a gift

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.300
for protecting me just now.

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:00.030
I just don't want you

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:01.100
to get hurt because of me.

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:10.340
Yes.

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:12.180
I forgot

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:14.940
how affectionate

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:16.100
yet heartless you can be.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:18.780
From beginning to end,

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.740
you only love Chu Yu.

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:26.380
It's also my fault.

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.380
The first time I saw you,

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:31.860
you were so stunning

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.220
that it became an obsession in my heart.

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.900
Actually, from the first time we met,

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:40.700
I should have known

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:43.500
that you don't belong to me,

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.340
nor to anyone else.

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:48.260
You will never be

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.460
a good husband,

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.220
but you will be a good official,

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.860
a good official for all the people.

Gu Chusheng,

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:44.780
you are free now,

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:47.300
and so am I.

Whenever you need a favor,

00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.340
let me know.

00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:22.580
Young Master,

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:23.940
where are we going?

Bravo!

00:34:43.890 --> 00:34:44.850
It's beautiful here.

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:49.370
Come! Come on!

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:53.100
Yu,

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:56.860
may you have peace
on the Sheri Festival,

00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:58.620
free from worries and troubles.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:04.600
It's so early in the morning.

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:05.920
I haven't even washed up yet.

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.180
What are you doing sneaking

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:09.020
into my courtyard?

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:10.780
I dared not do that.

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:12.560
I knocked on the window.

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:19.140
I wanted to take you somewhere.

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:21.620
Would you like to go?

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:27.620

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.060
Excuse me.

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:55.580
Why are there so many people here?

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.060
What?

00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:58.900
You don't know?

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:00.860
Last year,
the first one to hang the plate

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:02.900
was a scholar
who had been taking exams for years.

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:04.180
He actually passed the exams.

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:05.200
Also, it's said

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.120
that he'd been in love

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.260
with a noble lady for years,

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:08.820
and they finally got married last year.

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:09.900
That's why everyone

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:11.500
is here today to be the first one

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:12.860
to get a good omen.

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:15.420
Let's go, dear.

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:16.420
Sure.

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:20.340
If it's really that effective,

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:22.180
then we must be late.

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:24.580
Don't worry.

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:25.740
It's still early.

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:27.380
I have a trick up my sleeve.

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.860
Is this your trick?

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:40.900
A simple wall

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.300
should not be a problem

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:43.620
for Ms. Chu, right?

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:45.780
Aren't you the best at this?

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:50.820
It sounds like you can't do it.

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:53.020
You flatter me.

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:54.940
I learned from the best.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.860
I can't show off in front of you.

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:58.140
You taught me this.

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:00.140
Please show me some more.

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:01.940
You...

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:05.300
If you don't come,

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:06.380
I'll be the first one.

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:11.900
In your dreams.

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:24.380
Who's there?

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:55.580
What are you doing?

00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:58.960
The leaves I just swept

00:38:59.060 --> 00:38:59.900
are messed up again.

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:01.180
I thought I saw

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:02.300
two figures just now.

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:13.640
We haven't opened the door.

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:14.700
How could there be anyone?

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.140
Have you forgotten

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:19.220
what our master taught you?

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:21.620
It's not the wind nor the banner

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:22.480
that's moving;

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:24.140
it's your heart.

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:25.940
There is nothing in this world.

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:27.900
Feelings move with your heart.

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:30.660
You just think you're seeing things.

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:32.340
Alright.

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:33.820
Let's go and sweep the leaves.

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:35.080
The door is about to open.

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:36.900
If you keep being naughty,

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:38.480
I'll tell our master to punish you.

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:46.060
Senior, wait for me.

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:46.980
It's not the wind nor the banner

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:49.700
that's moving.

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:52.060
It's your heart.

00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:53.780
There is nothing in this world.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:56.140
Feelings move with your heart.

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:07.460
Chu Yu,

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:09.580
why is your pulse

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:12.140
so fast?

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:26.260
I'll surely be the first

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:27.620
to hang the prayer plate.
