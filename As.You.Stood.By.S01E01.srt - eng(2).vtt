AS YOU STOOD BY

00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:20.458
EP 01
EUN-SU

00:00:52.323 --> 00:00:54.200
You have gone off route.

00:00:58.913 --> 00:01:00.999
You have gone off route.

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:57.096
-I'll take this. Gift wrapped, please.
-Sure.

00:02:01.267 --> 00:02:03.228
Hey, Hui-su.
I'll be at the restaurant soon.

00:02:03.311 --> 00:02:05.605
Eun-su, I'm sorry. I'm still at home.

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:07.565
Why? Is something up?

00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:10.526
I had to meet
with my publisher unexpectedly.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.280
Thank you to all our customers here
at the Lavie Department Store…

00:02:14.364 --> 00:02:19.077
-Hui-su, you said you're at home, right?
-Yes, I'll be in touch after my deadline.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.289
We are running a special promotion
for newlyweds on popular brands…

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:43.643
Sounds good.

00:02:45.436 --> 00:02:49.691
All right. We have high hopes
since you, our top performers,

00:02:49.774 --> 00:02:52.986
are stationed at this year's
most carefully curated watch booth.

00:02:54.153 --> 00:02:54.988
Go get them, guys.

00:02:55.738 --> 00:02:56.572
You've got this.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.913
How's this one?

00:03:03.997 --> 00:03:07.000
If you're looking for something
more glamorous, how about…

00:03:09.836 --> 00:03:11.421
Okay, thank you.

00:03:17.593 --> 00:03:19.387
Would you like to try this on?

00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:34.777
It's been a while
since I've been greeted in Chinese.

00:03:39.282 --> 00:03:42.118
That's a relief,
since I can be of more help in Korean.

00:03:42.201 --> 00:03:44.787
I'm glad to help you.
Would you like to try this on?

00:03:44.871 --> 00:03:46.789
I haven't told you what I have my eye on.

00:03:54.088 --> 00:03:57.216
It's a premium model set with 90 diamonds,

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.345
and it's one of the slimmest
automatic watches in the world.

00:04:19.197 --> 00:04:20.323
A nice and simple pitch.

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:25.453
A shame that it's such a good fit.

00:04:28.081 --> 00:04:29.290
Does it not suit me?

00:04:33.211 --> 00:04:34.045
I wouldn't say that,

00:04:35.755 --> 00:04:36.756
but in your case,

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.551
I think this model would suit you better.

00:04:42.637 --> 00:04:43.513
No diamonds?

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.060
Even if it doesn't have gold,
platinum, or any diamonds,

00:04:49.143 --> 00:04:51.020
with your presence,

00:04:51.104 --> 00:04:53.773
even a steel watch speaks volumes.

00:04:54.357 --> 00:04:55.191
Right.

00:04:56.359 --> 00:04:58.277
Still, men should wear diamonds.

00:04:59.862 --> 00:05:00.696
Right.

00:05:07.662 --> 00:05:09.372
Huh? Why is this…

00:05:09.455 --> 00:05:10.373
Where could it…

00:05:11.707 --> 00:05:12.542
Is something up?

00:05:13.918 --> 00:05:14.752
It's gone.

00:05:16.796 --> 00:05:17.630
What is?

00:05:18.965 --> 00:05:21.717
It should be here, but it's not.

00:05:22.468 --> 00:05:23.428
What isn't here?

00:05:27.348 --> 00:05:29.350
The premium limited edition model.

00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:31.811
The one with a diamond bezel.

00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:38.776
Oh no, what should we do?

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.237
-What do we do?
-Hang on.

00:05:42.905 --> 00:05:44.949
I'm the only one
who handled this watch today,

00:05:45.032 --> 00:05:46.784
so this doesn't involve you two.

00:05:50.204 --> 00:05:51.289
I'll deal with it.

00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:09.849
Here.

00:06:10.766 --> 00:06:12.977
-Could you zoom in?
-Sure.

00:06:26.491 --> 00:06:28.826
He looked right at the security camera.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.416
We should notify the police.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.044
Then I'd need to notify our division head.

00:06:39.337 --> 00:06:41.923
Assistant Manager Jo,
first check the invite list.

00:06:42.006 --> 00:06:45.176
He came as a guest of Chairman Ma
from Shanghai. He's not on the list.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.223
It's not like
we can directly ask Chairman Ma.

00:06:51.224 --> 00:06:52.225
Please try it on…

00:06:53.684 --> 00:06:54.852
Hello, Chairman.

00:06:54.936 --> 00:06:56.312
Have you been well?

00:06:59.482 --> 00:07:00.441
Chairman Wang.

00:07:02.902 --> 00:07:04.320
I think I can find him.

00:07:08.324 --> 00:07:09.408
Thank you.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.833
JIN SO-BAEK

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:26.384
Hello.

00:07:27.218 --> 00:07:28.052
My God!

00:07:34.141 --> 00:07:37.270
-How many trucks are coming in today?
-Two box trucks in the afternoon.

00:07:52.201 --> 00:07:56.163
I haven't notified our division head yet,
so we can't get the police involved.

00:07:56.664 --> 00:08:01.627
Just drop him a hint
that we know he's the one who took it.

00:08:08.884 --> 00:08:10.136
Boss.

00:08:10.219 --> 00:08:12.513
There was an error
with the Lao Gan Ma order.

00:08:13.014 --> 00:08:14.932
It should have been ten,
but we ordered 35.

00:08:15.891 --> 00:08:16.726
Three…

00:08:18.644 --> 00:08:20.396
-Just 15.
-Just 15?

00:08:20.479 --> 00:08:21.772
Okay, I'll order 15.

00:08:22.356 --> 00:08:23.190
Hello.

00:08:23.274 --> 00:08:26.569
You're here early.
You haven't had breakfast, have you?

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.447
I know a good hangover soup joint.
It's on me.

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.866
I'll take back the watch
and buy breakfast.

00:08:32.366 --> 00:08:34.452
I guess I'll be skipping breakfast today.

00:08:34.535 --> 00:08:35.953
Man, I'm starving.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.087
Hey, Jenny.
Are you checking expiration dates?

00:08:48.466 --> 00:08:50.051
President Chen Shaobo.

00:08:52.345 --> 00:08:54.764
Could you please show me
that watch from yesterday?

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.725
What was that just now? Chen, what?

00:08:59.143 --> 00:09:02.813
Just call me Jin So-baek or President Jin.
Much easier to pronounce.

00:09:02.897 --> 00:09:04.023
What even was that?

00:09:08.194 --> 00:09:09.945
The watch isn't on me right now.

00:09:10.613 --> 00:09:11.447
If it's at home--

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:13.574
I sent it somewhere as a present.

00:09:15.576 --> 00:09:16.410
I'm sorry?

00:09:18.579 --> 00:09:20.581
What? It's not like I sold it.

00:09:21.082 --> 00:09:23.417
If they like it,
I'll purchase it right away.

00:09:24.585 --> 00:09:26.128
And if they don't like it?

00:09:26.212 --> 00:09:28.881
I'll return it immediately.
To your department store.

00:09:33.219 --> 00:09:36.847
You were invited by Chairman Ma
from Shanghai and know Chairman Wang,

00:09:36.931 --> 00:09:39.558
so we've decided to give you
a day's time, President Jin.

00:09:39.642 --> 00:09:43.020
If it isn't returned today,
you must buy it according to store policy.

00:09:43.104 --> 00:09:45.356
Let's do that.
I'll hear back today anyway.

00:09:46.816 --> 00:09:48.859
You're jumping through
all these hoops for me.

00:09:48.943 --> 00:09:52.154
If the purchase ends up happening,
I'll make sure it goes through you.

00:09:55.074 --> 00:09:56.283
I'm Jo Eun-su.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:02.248
Assistant Manager Jo Eun-su,

00:10:02.873 --> 00:10:04.333
I'll ensure you get the sale.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.342
Until then, I must ask you
for your written word.

00:10:13.843 --> 00:10:15.886
A piece of paper means nothing.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.889
If you're so anxious,
don't mind me and just call the cops.

00:10:53.924 --> 00:10:55.801
They're doing construction out there.

00:11:07.104 --> 00:11:09.482
Do you know
how many exits this building has?

00:11:14.278 --> 00:11:15.112
One there.

00:11:19.158 --> 00:11:20.159
Dear me.

00:11:20.701 --> 00:11:24.747
The first thing to do when collecting debt
is check the number and location of exits.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:26.791
You've got grit but no finesse.

00:11:29.251 --> 00:11:30.628
I am tenacious though.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.716
Today's not over,
so could I please get it in writing?

00:11:38.719 --> 00:11:41.764
I've found carrying a knife
to be more effective than paper.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.978
I don't have a knife.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:21.136
THREE

00:12:26.225 --> 00:12:27.893
-Enjoy!
-Thank you!

00:12:35.276 --> 00:12:37.319
One floor up
from the Jingang Chinese Market.

00:14:18.504 --> 00:14:19.546
Take it.

00:14:24.677 --> 00:14:26.011
HUI-SU

00:14:26.095 --> 00:14:27.513
SORRY, I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:38.524
They knew it was a bribe,
but they insisted it should be a gift.

00:14:38.607 --> 00:14:40.150
That thieving bastard.

00:14:49.326 --> 00:14:50.869
You think I switched it out?

00:14:51.662 --> 00:14:54.164
Not you but that thieving bastard.

00:15:08.637 --> 00:15:09.847
The watch is clean,

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:12.391
but there's a small scratch on the strap.

00:15:12.474 --> 00:15:14.685
Unlikely. I checked the thing myself.

00:15:18.939 --> 00:15:20.441
I bet it will wipe away.

00:15:20.524 --> 00:15:23.819
We can't wipe it down
and sell it to another customer.

00:15:25.571 --> 00:15:28.073
So, Mr. Jin, you'll need to purchase it.

00:15:37.708 --> 00:15:38.625
The day isn't over yet.

00:15:40.169 --> 00:15:42.337
You could just buy the strap.

00:15:46.383 --> 00:15:48.844
It's expensive
because it's premium croc leather

00:15:48.927 --> 00:15:50.763
and only 100 are made a year,

00:15:50.846 --> 00:15:52.931
but it suits that watch
you're wearing now.

00:15:53.015 --> 00:15:54.975
I can change the strap for you now.

00:16:01.398 --> 00:16:03.776
I don't want the strap.
Let's settle at three million.

00:16:03.859 --> 00:16:05.819
You'll know that's a decent deal.

00:16:08.113 --> 00:16:08.947
My apologies.

00:16:09.656 --> 00:16:12.451
So you lack both finesse and acumen.

00:16:13.702 --> 00:16:15.162
I'd have asked for five million.

00:16:15.245 --> 00:16:16.789
And I'd never have stolen…

00:16:19.291 --> 00:16:20.959
taken it in the first place.

00:16:24.755 --> 00:16:27.424
Why go to such lengths
when you're still on a payroll?

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:32.179
My goal is to be promoted to an executive.

00:16:59.998 --> 00:17:03.377
I'm not one to strike a deal
that doesn't benefit me.

00:17:10.926 --> 00:17:15.514
JINGANG CHINESE MARKET

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.649
Why did you steal the watch?

00:17:27.526 --> 00:17:30.195
I told you earlier
that I borrowed it temporarily.

00:17:30.279 --> 00:17:32.072
I couldn't tell from the outside,

00:17:32.156 --> 00:17:34.241
but this isn't just a small market.

00:17:34.867 --> 00:17:38.912
You're the president
of this huge trading company.

00:17:38.996 --> 00:17:41.039
I wasn't sure
they'd be signing the contract.

00:17:41.123 --> 00:17:43.500
You want me to carry all that cash
and buy it, then return it?

00:17:47.671 --> 00:17:51.091
You speak nonsense with such confidence

00:17:51.175 --> 00:17:53.719
that you almost had me
nodding in agreement.

00:18:08.358 --> 00:18:09.193
Jo Eun-su.

00:18:17.659 --> 00:18:19.036
Are there times…

00:18:24.499 --> 00:18:25.792
when you unleash…

00:18:30.005 --> 00:18:31.798
the psycho inside you?

00:18:56.531 --> 00:19:00.077
Seems to me like you've always held back
your emotions to prevent that.

00:19:15.425 --> 00:19:17.511
Why don't you come and work for me?

00:19:18.845 --> 00:19:19.680
No, thanks.

00:19:23.725 --> 00:19:26.937
If you hand me your watch,
I'll change the strap for you.

00:19:31.692 --> 00:19:33.235
The sound of these tiles.

00:19:35.821 --> 00:19:37.656
It's calming when a lot is on your mind.

00:19:39.616 --> 00:19:40.450
On second thought,

00:19:40.534 --> 00:19:43.745
I'm the one who was just ripped off,
so I need this more.

00:19:44.288 --> 00:19:45.205
Clatter.

00:19:48.292 --> 00:19:49.835
Clatter…

00:19:51.295 --> 00:19:53.880
Clatter…

00:20:08.061 --> 00:20:09.563
I'm clumsy with my hands.

00:20:14.318 --> 00:20:15.402
Indeed, you are.

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:20.490
I bet Hui-su would be great at this.

00:20:20.991 --> 00:20:22.909
My friend. She's great with her hands.

00:20:23.535 --> 00:20:25.245
Great at writing and drawing.

00:20:25.871 --> 00:20:27.164
She's a storybook author.

00:20:36.631 --> 00:20:38.133
Storybook?

00:20:39.509 --> 00:20:42.763
The sort of stories that end with
"and they lived happily ever after."

00:20:44.473 --> 00:20:46.475
-The watch strap--
-Switch it out next time.

00:21:06.453 --> 00:21:08.455
Let me at least carry this for you.

00:21:10.582 --> 00:21:12.376
That man, Jin So-baek.

00:21:12.459 --> 00:21:15.545
The manager was worried
since we had no info on him.

00:21:16.088 --> 00:21:19.508
I mean, I knew you'd do it,
but to solve it on your own…

00:21:19.591 --> 00:21:21.760
Wow, I truly respect you.

00:21:22.719 --> 00:21:23.970
Cut it out.

00:21:25.472 --> 00:21:27.724
Hey, can you leave this by my station?

00:21:28.517 --> 00:21:29.351
Sure.

00:21:33.105 --> 00:21:33.939
Hello.

00:21:36.066 --> 00:21:37.901
Hello, Eun-su.

00:21:37.984 --> 00:21:39.444
Hello. Are you well?

00:21:40.654 --> 00:21:41.488
Of course.

00:21:46.076 --> 00:21:47.077
This.

00:21:48.078 --> 00:21:49.246
Would it suit Hui-su?

00:21:50.622 --> 00:21:52.124
Yes, it's stunning.

00:21:53.333 --> 00:21:56.545
But it's not her birthday
or your wedding anniversary.

00:21:59.005 --> 00:22:01.591
-I get her gifts now and then.
-You mean often.

00:22:01.675 --> 00:22:03.176
He's one of our regulars.

00:22:03.969 --> 00:22:06.430
I didn't know Hui-su came here often.

00:22:07.597 --> 00:22:11.226
I come alone to make the purchases.
Hui-su likes surprises.

00:22:11.852 --> 00:22:12.686
She does?

00:22:13.603 --> 00:22:17.232
She hates not knowing, so she skips
to the last page of mystery novels.

00:22:18.984 --> 00:22:20.402
All wrapped for you now.

00:22:20.485 --> 00:22:22.612
Great, thank you. I'll see you soon.

00:22:23.155 --> 00:22:23.989
After you.

00:22:29.828 --> 00:22:30.954
All right, see you.

00:22:34.833 --> 00:22:36.168
He's become much gentler.

00:22:43.175 --> 00:22:44.301
HUI-SU

00:22:44.384 --> 00:22:47.304
MRS. KANG HUI-YEON

00:22:48.597 --> 00:22:49.598
Hello, ma'am.

00:23:12.329 --> 00:23:13.163
Ma'am!

00:23:14.331 --> 00:23:15.248
Are you hurt?

00:23:18.043 --> 00:23:19.377
Please zip me up.

00:23:20.921 --> 00:23:21.755
Of course.

00:24:03.797 --> 00:24:05.131
I thought you, Eun-su…

00:24:08.927 --> 00:24:10.387
would be different.

00:24:16.601 --> 00:24:17.519
I…

00:24:19.145 --> 00:24:23.191
Customer privacy is our VIP sales team's

00:24:23.733 --> 00:24:24.609
top priority…

00:24:27.612 --> 00:24:28.613
Sir.

00:24:33.994 --> 00:24:34.995
You were in here?

00:24:39.457 --> 00:24:40.959
With a jacket on…

00:24:43.545 --> 00:24:44.963
you'd look more elegant.

00:24:48.883 --> 00:24:49.884
Good.

00:24:51.553 --> 00:24:52.929
You'll just wear that out.

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:55.015
Please do, ma'am.

00:24:56.474 --> 00:24:58.018
What do you think, Ms. Jo?

00:25:04.649 --> 00:25:05.609
It suits her.

00:25:08.069 --> 00:25:09.446
You do have a good eye.

00:25:18.121 --> 00:25:21.916
The boutique next door
has the perfect shoes for this outfit.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.918
Could I take her for a look?

00:25:38.308 --> 00:25:40.310
You know my wife's shoe size.

00:25:45.565 --> 00:25:46.858
Just have them delivered.

00:25:48.902 --> 00:25:49.778
Will do, sir.

00:26:05.126 --> 00:26:06.920
There are a lot of shoes here.

00:26:07.504 --> 00:26:08.505
What about those?

00:26:09.255 --> 00:26:10.423
Yes, those will do.

00:26:11.508 --> 00:26:13.343
They ate up a whole 50 minutes.

00:26:13.843 --> 00:26:16.262
Why did she have to do that in our store?

00:26:19.349 --> 00:26:20.600
My lips are sealed.

00:26:57.971 --> 00:27:00.348
Did something happen
with President Kwon Seong-cheol?

00:27:02.392 --> 00:27:03.685
Why do you ask?

00:27:03.768 --> 00:27:08.481
He just preordered
500 year-end gift sets in your name.

00:27:09.816 --> 00:27:10.734
Under my name?

00:27:12.777 --> 00:27:14.738
I hear you helped his wife today.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.448
That Mr. Kwon…

00:27:16.948 --> 00:27:21.453
I knew he'd been one of our top ten VIPs
over the past ten years, but wow.

00:27:22.203 --> 00:27:25.874
Thanks to you, we won't have to worry
about this quarter's numbers.

00:27:33.173 --> 00:27:35.884
GANGCHEOL JIUJITSU

00:27:49.731 --> 00:27:51.274
Wait, tap!

00:27:57.447 --> 00:27:59.199
Even if he doesn't shut me up,

00:27:59.699 --> 00:28:02.368
being discreet
and playing dumb are my forte.

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:06.164
Jo Eun-su.

00:28:28.394 --> 00:28:30.647
I'm surprised you held out,
being so distracted.

00:28:36.236 --> 00:28:38.196
Only because you let me.

00:29:45.471 --> 00:29:47.849
MOM'S BIRTHDAY TOMORROW
TELL HER I CAN'T VISIT

00:29:56.316 --> 00:29:59.110
CUSTOMER: KANG HUI-YEON
LIVES IN HANNAM-DONG

00:30:11.539 --> 00:30:12.874
I thought you, Eun-su…

00:30:15.668 --> 00:30:17.128
would be different.

00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:54.290
MOM

00:30:54.374 --> 00:30:55.458
Eun-su?

00:30:56.542 --> 00:30:58.920
Eun-su. What is it?

00:30:59.629 --> 00:31:01.547
Hey, did I wake you?

00:31:02.215 --> 00:31:05.551
No, I wasn't asleep yet. Is something up?

00:31:08.262 --> 00:31:11.557
I won't be able to make it
for your birthday.

00:31:12.058 --> 00:31:15.728
I know. You're busy. Come some other time.

00:31:16.521 --> 00:31:17.855
All right. Good night.

00:31:21.609 --> 00:31:23.778
But what were you doing up so late?

00:31:24.862 --> 00:31:25.738
I was just

00:31:27.073 --> 00:31:28.324
drinking soju.

00:31:29.117 --> 00:31:30.201
On your own?

00:31:30.284 --> 00:31:31.119
Yes.

00:31:33.705 --> 00:31:34.622
Well done, you.

00:31:35.123 --> 00:31:37.709
And you? What are you doing up?

00:31:38.209 --> 00:31:40.795
For a young woman like me,
it's the early evening.

00:31:41.295 --> 00:31:42.505
I was drinking beer.

00:31:43.131 --> 00:31:44.090
Well done, you.

00:31:47.552 --> 00:31:48.386
Good night.

00:31:49.262 --> 00:31:50.304
These days…

00:31:52.849 --> 00:31:56.310
I walk in the park with your dad
every evening.

00:32:01.899 --> 00:32:02.775
And?

00:32:06.821 --> 00:32:10.491
I just thought I'd tell you.
You must be tired. Get some sleep.

00:33:07.173 --> 00:33:08.508
I'm here too early.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:16.974
How…

00:33:17.517 --> 00:33:19.268
how come you're here?

00:33:20.061 --> 00:33:21.687
I didn't prepare any food.

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:23.856
I brought you cake.

00:33:29.153 --> 00:33:29.987
You're here?

00:33:49.924 --> 00:33:52.176
You still store your knives in there?

00:33:52.677 --> 00:33:53.845
Isn't it inconvenient?

00:33:55.388 --> 00:33:57.723
It's okay. I find this most convenient.

00:34:03.229 --> 00:34:04.981
Do you stay at home during the day?

00:34:05.606 --> 00:34:08.317
I hang out with the ladies
in the neighborhood,

00:34:09.152 --> 00:34:11.571
but they always want to go
to the bathhouse.

00:34:16.117 --> 00:34:16.951
And?

00:34:18.911 --> 00:34:19.745
Do you join them?

00:34:22.206 --> 00:34:24.417
Why would I when I can bathe at home?

00:34:29.213 --> 00:34:32.049
You have always disliked
public bathhouses.

00:34:33.885 --> 00:34:37.471
I bet I'm the only one who never went
to a bathhouse with their mom as a kid.

00:34:42.935 --> 00:34:45.188
While we're on the subject,
shall we go tomorrow morning?

00:34:50.985 --> 00:34:53.112
Eun-hyeok called to say he's coming.

00:34:58.117 --> 00:35:00.119
How many times are you gonna taste it?

00:35:08.002 --> 00:35:09.378
Mom, I'm home.

00:35:13.507 --> 00:35:15.259
Dad, I'm home.

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:20.389
Mom, here.

00:35:20.473 --> 00:35:21.307
Let's see.

00:35:22.391 --> 00:35:24.894
My, you're made of steel.

00:35:26.646 --> 00:35:27.647
Bring out the cake.

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:32.109
Let me clear the food away first.

00:35:32.193 --> 00:35:34.570
Cake's also food.

00:35:35.279 --> 00:35:38.199
Bring it out.
Let's get the candles over with.

00:35:39.492 --> 00:35:42.870
Department store cakes sure are something.
It's absolutely exquisite.

00:35:42.954 --> 00:35:46.040
We should digest a bit,
light the candles, and take some photos--

00:35:51.003 --> 00:35:52.713
You sure talk a lot.

00:35:53.798 --> 00:35:54.799
Dad.

00:35:58.928 --> 00:36:02.139
Happy birthday to you

00:36:02.223 --> 00:36:05.476
Happy birthday to you

00:36:05.559 --> 00:36:09.522
Happy birthday, dear Gye-sun

00:36:09.605 --> 00:36:12.692
Happy birthday to you

00:37:46.077 --> 00:37:48.204
Mouthing off to me over some measly cake.

00:37:48.287 --> 00:37:51.957
They never show their precious faces
for my birthday but show up for yours.

00:37:52.041 --> 00:37:53.584
Are you feeling smug? Are you?

00:37:53.667 --> 00:37:55.127
-Mom.
-Are you enjoying this?

00:37:59.131 --> 00:38:00.257
Do you still hit Mom?

00:38:01.342 --> 00:38:03.552
Eun-su, that's not it.

00:38:04.053 --> 00:38:07.181
I was coming down to go to the toilet…

00:38:07.264 --> 00:38:09.892
Is that why you hide the kitchen knives?

00:38:10.476 --> 00:38:12.019
So he can't get to them?

00:38:13.729 --> 00:38:14.855
Why, you little…

00:38:15.606 --> 00:38:17.775
You've been telling her such things?

00:38:23.489 --> 00:38:26.367
Do you know Mom tried to kill herself
when I was in high school?

00:38:30.496 --> 00:38:31.330
Eun-su.

00:38:33.332 --> 00:38:34.208
What?

00:38:35.084 --> 00:38:38.379
What happened that day still haunts me.
It drives me crazy.

00:38:56.147 --> 00:39:00.192
THE YEAR 2008

00:39:04.488 --> 00:39:05.322
Mom!

00:39:06.866 --> 00:39:07.700
Mom, no!

00:39:15.374 --> 00:39:17.668
Mom! Please don't!

00:39:18.294 --> 00:39:20.171
Mom, you can't!

00:39:24.008 --> 00:39:25.551
Eun-su.

00:39:25.634 --> 00:39:27.344
Did Dad hit you again?

00:39:27.428 --> 00:39:28.971
No, that's not it.

00:39:30.264 --> 00:39:31.474
He doesn't hit me.

00:39:31.557 --> 00:39:33.976
Does he still hit you
when we aren't home?

00:39:36.395 --> 00:39:39.273
You can't tell Eun-hyeok. Or Dad.

00:39:39.356 --> 00:39:41.650
Mom.

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.720
Jong-gu kept me gaming all night.

00:40:11.514 --> 00:40:12.890
You're already leaving?

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:15.893
-Yes.
-I'm going to shower and head out too.

00:40:15.976 --> 00:40:16.894
Let's go together.

00:40:16.977 --> 00:40:18.103
I'm giving Dad a lift.

00:40:19.104 --> 00:40:19.939
See you.

00:40:28.197 --> 00:40:29.031
About…

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.451
what happened yesterday…

00:40:44.964 --> 00:40:47.091
The city hall is that way.

00:40:49.176 --> 00:40:50.010
Eun-su.

00:41:00.479 --> 00:41:01.313
Get out.

00:41:02.022 --> 00:41:05.359
Turn yourself in for the domestic violence
you've committed until now.

00:41:06.694 --> 00:41:08.862
Enough with the attitude.
Turn the car around.

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:12.157
I've never hit you kids. Not once.

00:41:13.909 --> 00:41:16.495
Do you know
how pathetic it feels to be a coward?

00:41:17.663 --> 00:41:19.623
Why couldn't you have hit me too?

00:41:21.292 --> 00:41:23.502
Then at least I'd have an excuse

00:41:23.586 --> 00:41:26.463
for playing dumb about you beating Mom.

00:41:30.217 --> 00:41:31.385
Shall I file a report?

00:41:31.468 --> 00:41:32.886
Do you really think

00:41:34.054 --> 00:41:36.181
they'd lock me up for my private affairs?

00:41:46.066 --> 00:41:46.900
Get out.

00:41:48.569 --> 00:41:49.612
What are you doing?

00:41:50.904 --> 00:41:52.740
What do you think you're doing?

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:14.553
GANGNEUNG POLICE STATION

00:42:44.458 --> 00:42:45.292
Stop that!

00:42:45.376 --> 00:42:46.877
Hey, what's wrong with you?

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.045
Hey, Jo Eun-su.

00:42:48.128 --> 00:42:49.838
I asked you not to do that.

00:42:50.923 --> 00:42:53.550
What's wrong with you?
What were we even doing?

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:05.229
Everything's okay now.

00:43:14.446 --> 00:43:16.281
Were those two even friends?

00:43:16.365 --> 00:43:19.076
No, I've never seen
the two of them together.

00:43:19.159 --> 00:43:20.994
Then what's with the theatrics?

00:43:28.794 --> 00:43:29.837
Hui-su.

00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:45.978
Hey, Hui-su.

00:43:46.061 --> 00:43:49.857
I'm outside your place,
but I guess you're not home.

00:43:50.941 --> 00:43:52.985
I went home to Gangneung,

00:43:53.068 --> 00:43:55.154
and I just wanted to chat with you.

00:44:13.756 --> 00:44:15.174
The doors are closing.

00:44:29.688 --> 00:44:30.564
Hui-su!

00:44:31.273 --> 00:44:32.983
Hui-su. It's me, Eun-su.

00:44:49.374 --> 00:44:50.834
You're in there, aren't you?

00:44:52.836 --> 00:44:53.921
What is it?

00:44:54.004 --> 00:44:55.964
Why are you acting so strange?

00:44:57.633 --> 00:44:59.551
Go, Eun-su. I'll call you later.

00:45:23.116 --> 00:45:24.034
Jeez.

00:45:24.868 --> 00:45:26.078
Why didn't you tap out?

00:45:29.206 --> 00:45:30.707
And this happened to you?

00:45:30.791 --> 00:45:32.376
A FEW HOURS AGO

00:45:32.459 --> 00:45:34.920
Not me, but my friend.

00:45:36.213 --> 00:45:38.048
Are you going to file a report?

00:45:40.509 --> 00:45:41.343
Sorry?

00:45:42.803 --> 00:45:44.054
Are you going to sue?

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:47.891
Officer Kim?

00:45:50.143 --> 00:45:52.688
This is the Sinsa substation.
How can I help you?

00:45:55.023 --> 00:45:56.859
It's almost like you're a restaurant

00:45:56.942 --> 00:46:00.028
asking, "Table for how many?
What would you like to order?"

00:46:32.644 --> 00:46:36.023
Didn't you hear him tap out?
Everyone across the room heard him.

00:46:37.816 --> 00:46:38.650
Jo Eun-su.

00:46:42.905 --> 00:46:44.323
No sparring for a month.

00:46:48.994 --> 00:46:50.871
And no access to the gym for a month.

00:47:49.513 --> 00:47:50.806
Let's play hide-and-seek.

00:47:52.224 --> 00:47:53.517
-Who's "it"?
-Hush.

00:48:01.733 --> 00:48:03.652
I'm sleepy, Eun-su.

00:48:07.489 --> 00:48:09.825
Let me push you a few more times, okay?

00:48:34.141 --> 00:48:35.308
Hey, Jo Eun-su!

00:48:36.143 --> 00:48:37.602
Eun-su!

00:48:54.411 --> 00:48:55.787
-Peace signs.
-Peace.

00:48:57.372 --> 00:48:58.457
I feel silly.

00:48:59.458 --> 00:49:01.043
One more with big smiles.

00:49:01.126 --> 00:49:02.252
Now, three, two, one.

00:49:02.878 --> 00:49:04.421
-Smile.
-Eun-su, get in here.

00:49:06.757 --> 00:49:07.591
All right.

00:49:13.638 --> 00:49:15.724
What's the big deal? It's fine.

00:50:04.856 --> 00:50:06.858
I called to ask you
to switch my watch strap,

00:50:06.942 --> 00:50:09.152
only to be summoned by a bar owner.

00:50:12.864 --> 00:50:13.907
My apologies.

00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:16.284
And thank you.
I'll repay you for the drinks.

00:50:16.785 --> 00:50:17.661
As you should.

00:50:22.541 --> 00:50:23.750
Did someone hit you?

00:50:28.713 --> 00:50:31.174
You talked in your sleep
the entire ride back.

00:50:40.934 --> 00:50:45.230
If you found out that someone close to you
was being abused, what would you…

00:50:52.404 --> 00:50:54.656
Thank you so much for yesterday.

00:50:56.867 --> 00:50:59.119
I have somewhere to be, so I've got to go.

00:51:26.188 --> 00:51:27.022
Coming through.

00:51:27.898 --> 00:51:28.732
Right.

00:51:34.029 --> 00:51:37.365
JINGANG CHINESE MARKET

00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:05.185
EUN-HYEOK

00:52:08.063 --> 00:52:08.897
Eun-su.

00:52:09.731 --> 00:52:10.982
I'm moving back home.

00:52:11.858 --> 00:52:13.318
I requested a transfer.

00:52:14.569 --> 00:52:15.487
Eun-hyeok.

00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:17.614
Jong-gu's younger sibling
is a police officer.

00:52:18.865 --> 00:52:20.116
They saw you and Dad.

00:52:23.745 --> 00:52:25.080
When we were young,

00:52:25.163 --> 00:52:27.457
we often hid in the closet together.

00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:30.043
We weren't playing, were we?

00:52:31.336 --> 00:52:32.712
It made no sense

00:52:32.796 --> 00:52:34.923
for the both of us to hide together.

00:52:36.925 --> 00:52:38.176
So Dad was "it."

00:52:40.637 --> 00:52:42.347
You were just a kid too.

00:52:45.392 --> 00:52:46.601
I'm sorry, Eun-su.

00:52:50.855 --> 00:52:53.108
Why would you apologize? What for?

00:52:54.234 --> 00:52:55.110
About Dad…

00:52:56.736 --> 00:52:58.154
You did the right thing.

00:52:58.238 --> 00:53:00.240
And don't worry about Mom anymore.

00:53:02.158 --> 00:53:03.827
Get to work. Let's get rich.

00:53:19.342 --> 00:53:22.095
HUI-SU, WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?
HAVE YOU HAD LUNCH?

00:53:22.178 --> 00:53:24.723
THE WEATHER'S LOVELY, LOOK OUTSIDE

00:53:30.562 --> 00:53:31.396
All done.

00:53:43.450 --> 00:53:46.745
This is your receipt and authenticity card
for the watch strap.

00:53:48.872 --> 00:53:52.334
And this is for the drinks from last time.
Thank you again.

00:54:02.469 --> 00:54:04.846
I returned the watch to you
that day, right?

00:54:05.347 --> 00:54:06.431
You owe me a meal.

00:54:15.982 --> 00:54:19.527
As the domestic economy continues
to show signs of a slowdown,

00:54:19.611 --> 00:54:23.490
there is a growing demand for government
to provide additional stimulus.

00:54:23.573 --> 00:54:27.494
For trivial matters to fade away,
you should treat them as trivial.

00:54:32.123 --> 00:54:34.167
What if it's not a trivial matter?

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:41.299
Then you let your inner psycho out of you.

00:54:46.596 --> 00:54:48.848
Now the latest accident reports.

00:54:48.932 --> 00:54:51.351
A woman tragically ended her life

00:54:51.434 --> 00:54:54.646
by jumping in front of her husband's car.

00:54:54.729 --> 00:54:58.608
The incident occurred in an upscale area
in Hannam-dong, Seoul,

00:54:58.691 --> 00:55:02.070
when Kang threw herself in front of
her husband Kwon's imported SUV.

00:55:02.153 --> 00:55:03.655
VICTIM OF ABUSE JUMPS IN FRONT OF CAR

00:55:03.738 --> 00:55:05.824
Kwon is known to run a mid-sized company.

00:55:06.324 --> 00:55:09.869
Her husband, Kwon,
insists that the incident was an accident…

00:55:09.953 --> 00:55:11.538
VIP SALES LEE DONG-GYU

00:55:11.621 --> 00:55:13.873
…but bruises and evidence of abuse
were found on her body…

00:55:13.957 --> 00:55:15.834
Ms. Jo, have you seen the news?

00:55:15.917 --> 00:55:17.961
Mrs. Kang Hui-yeon passed away.

00:55:18.044 --> 00:55:18.878
What?

00:55:20.422 --> 00:55:24.008
We're to head to the funeral home
with black funeral clothes for the family…

00:55:24.884 --> 00:55:25.718
Ms. Jo?

00:55:26.261 --> 00:55:27.637
Are you listening?

00:55:30.432 --> 00:55:31.808
I thought you, Eun-su…

00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:35.687
would be different.

00:55:43.862 --> 00:55:44.696
MOM

00:55:48.199 --> 00:55:49.200
Hey, Eun-su.

00:55:50.535 --> 00:55:51.953
Why do you have Mom's phone?

00:55:53.246 --> 00:55:54.622
Mom's washing her hair.

00:55:56.749 --> 00:55:57.584
Okay.

00:55:58.835 --> 00:56:00.170
I'll call again later.

00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:08.094
HUI-SU

00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:32.368
I looked the other way.

00:56:33.661 --> 00:56:34.537
I need to go.

00:56:37.457 --> 00:56:41.377
You're not going to say something stupid
like, "It's my fault she's dead," are you?

00:56:41.461 --> 00:56:43.963
And how are you going to drive
when you're trembling?

00:56:45.131 --> 00:56:46.674
I need to see her.

00:56:56.976 --> 00:56:59.354
She should have killed her damn husband.

00:57:05.693 --> 00:57:08.571
Why throw away your life
instead of living to see him off?

00:57:08.655 --> 00:57:11.282
That motherfucking douchebag.

00:57:33.096 --> 00:57:34.514
What happened to you?

00:57:35.223 --> 00:57:38.268
Eun-su, you should go now.
Let's talk later.

00:57:49.737 --> 00:57:50.572
Hui-su.

00:57:56.077 --> 00:57:57.620
Hui-su, please don't! No!

00:58:03.626 --> 00:58:04.460
Eun-su.

00:58:09.716 --> 00:58:11.593
I want to end it all now.

00:58:11.676 --> 00:58:13.136
No, Hui-su, you can't!

00:58:13.678 --> 00:58:15.096
Please, no!

00:58:16.222 --> 00:58:17.098
No!

00:58:18.224 --> 00:58:19.225
No…

00:58:19.726 --> 00:58:21.686
I don't want to die at his hands.

00:58:23.229 --> 00:58:24.689
I have to end this myself.

00:58:32.113 --> 00:58:33.239
Let's kill him.

00:58:38.202 --> 00:58:40.038
We'll kill your husband.

01:01:51.103 --> 01:01:56.108
