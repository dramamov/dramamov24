[Episode 27]

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.930
[Zhoudi Tower]

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.470
Lici, what are you doing?

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.280
The Three Character Classic?

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.120
Fang Zhou asked you to transcribe it?

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.120
Indeed.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.920
You are supposed

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.250
to study this properly.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.070
[Fang Zhou]

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.010
Why did you write this?

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.000
Fang Zhou

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.190
asked me

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:17.079
to write the name.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.120
He meant for you to write

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.280
your own name.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.370
Silly boy.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.980
Come on,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.980
give me the pen.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:28.840
Tang,

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:30.470
Li,

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.030
Ci.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.030
But there are only

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.000
two names on it.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.960
For fairness,

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.920
let's add the others as well.

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:50.570
[Liu Yan]

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.079
Fu,

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.910
come here.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.380
Hurry up.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.310
Give me your hand.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.130
[Fu Zhumei]

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.930
You came all this way
to find the Physician of Miracle

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.460
only to end up like this.

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:55.770
What?

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.190
You can't trick me out of

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.210
the other half of the Rebirth Scroll,

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.270
so you're anxious?

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:02.680
What a pity

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.990
that you've run into me again.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.710
Once I'm here,

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.590
you just can't escape.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.000
There's a barrier here.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.680
We both have our strength

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.480
reduced to less than 30 percent.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.160
Just now,

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.800
it was because you

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.190
fell into this barrier

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.070
that the Floating Red Worm Silk

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.550
slipped off you.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.310
You can't kill me now.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.810
You can only stay here and listen to me.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.540
Listen to your gibberish?

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.090
You'll have to listen anyway.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.480
Were it not for you,

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.000
I wouldn't have fallen down here.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.870
Are you saying

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.550
that I got you into danger?

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.159
Liu Yan,

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:51.920
do you really think

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.600
that our seven years of friendship were

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.830
something I faked

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.250
day after day?

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.310
For others,

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.680
it might be impossible.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.160
But for you,

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:05.870
Tang Lici,

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.970
it might not be so difficult.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.510
Perhaps I could pull it off now,

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.100
but the old me

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.150
definitely couldn't.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.430
Given the ceaseless strong winds here,

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.800
there must be a vortex

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:38.880
below the abyss.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.990
With just one person's strength,

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.430
neither of us can

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.310
get out of here.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.560
So...

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.810
What trick are you playing this time?

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.550
I'll dive into the vortex

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.950
and block it
with sound waves from my flute.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.170
The strong winds will stop temporarily.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.360
If we're lucky,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.780
this pulling force

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.950
will cease.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.850
And you can go up.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.390
Can this really work?

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:10.480
Not sure.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.510
But we can only try this way.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.280
I can only block the vortex for a moment.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.940
When it's done,

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.540
we both need to move quickly.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.080
Infused with inner strength,
the Floating Red Worm Silk

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.710
can extend

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.320
to 166 meters at most.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.350
After I block the vortex,

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.810
I'll shake the red silk.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:25.690
At that moment,

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.390
you should use the same force

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.000
to shake the other end of the silk.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.630
Our combined forces will hit
the bottom of the cliff.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.950
Then, with the counterforce
of the Sound Killing Technique,

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.280
you can escape from here

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.130
and pull me out as well.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.600
Should I repeat that?

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:40.909
Do you even know what you're saying?

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.040
Don't bother.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:44.420
I'm injured

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.070
and can only use Sound Killing once.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.670
Seize the chance on your own.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:50.310
Wait!

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:20.430
Found it.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.460
White Dragon Dance of Supreme Energy.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.520
The flute sound is weak.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.760
He's more severely injured than I thought.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.870
Yan,

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:14.000
Zhoudi Tower once had a duet

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.680
that could multiply

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.010
the powers of both players temporarily.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:24.600
Trust.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.700
As long as there's mutual trust,

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.620
the melody
can just greatly boost our powers.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:40.980
That melody is called

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:43.370
Clear Rivers, Calm Seas,

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.300
Peaceful World.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:25.840
Liu Yan,

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.610
meet me at the Zhoudi Tower
in half a month.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:32.750
Tang Lici!

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.440
Tang Lici!

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.240
Tang Lici!

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.660
Master!

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.510
I don't have time to mess with you today.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:52.240
Get lost!

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.670
Where is Tang Lici?

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.330
I also want to know where he is!

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.440
Right,

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.300
the Zhoudi Tower.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.730
[Time-Space Rift, Mount Baojing]

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:54.910
Gumo State was only

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:55.910
the size of a city.

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:57.440
To stop the plague from spreading,

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.670
the King gathered the bodies
and burned them.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:00.560
In a single night,

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.160
the entire city burned down.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:03.480
Gumo State?

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:04.810
It seems

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:06.940
that I'm at the ruins of Gumo State.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.340
But why do these murals

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:10.890
give off a vibe of the Tianren Realm?

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:43.990
Over five decades ago,

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:45.670
I broke through the Void

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.270
and left the Tianren Realm.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.310
But I was attacked

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.640
by a Tuo Dragon
surviving at the Void's edge,

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.170
which severely injured me.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.130
In my haste,

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.890
I landed in Gumo State in Shenzhou.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.330
It was exactly where

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:01.630
I met

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:02.960
this state's princess.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:06.960
Who's there?

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.450
Why are you lying on the altar?

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:15.550
Who are you?

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.020
Can you hear me?

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:19.750
What happened to you?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
There are wounds all over your body.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:23.860
Your wounds

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.170
healed on their own!

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.810
Are you a deity from heaven?

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.080
This is my first time

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.000
seeing a deity.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:32.580
Just like

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:33.720
the legends say.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.440
What's your name?

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:41.150
My name is

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.030
Ye Mo.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.030
Ye Mo?

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.890
The King of Gumo State believed
my appearance

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:52.910
meant he had received

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:54.170
the gods' protection.

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.630
He begged me to stay.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:01.030
Princess Xi Ya
stayed by my side all the time

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.790
and told me

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:03.750
many things about Shenzhou.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.320
Those were

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.520
my happiest moments.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.870
I was so happy

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:09.440
that I almost forgot

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.000
why I came here.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.270
This is Gumo State's sacred relic

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.960
passed down through generations.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.820
They say it also fell from heaven.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:19.530
I'll give it to you as a token.

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.160
But the good times didn't last.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:38.320
Gumo State was struck

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.120
by a once-in-a-century plague.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:42.190
Countless people suffered and died.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:46.670
State Deity, please use your magic
to save our people.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.480
What can I do to eliminate the plague?

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.440
State Deity,

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.160
the Ancestor of Gumo State

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.560
built this altar here

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.790
because this place

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:55.990
connects to the state's every ley line.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.670
The Ancestor's prophecy said

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:59.180
that after the altar was completed,

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.380
an immortal would descend from heaven.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:03.370
If the state faced danger,

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:05.990
he would use the Heaven-Halo Technique

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:07.550
to absorb all the miasma

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:09.350
hidden in the state's ley lines.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.070
Heaven-Halo Technique?

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.960
With this altar,

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.950
you can guide the ley line energy

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:18.950
through your self-healing body

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.210
to purify the miasma.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.300
I was a bit confused back then.

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:24.670
How did the King know

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:27.070
the secret technique of the Tianren Realm?

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:29.200
But I was so focused on saving people

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.260
that I didn't think too much about it.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.480
I only realized later

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.120
that he was

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.480
up to something else.

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:46.670
He's invaded my mind?

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.840
The secret scroll does tell the truth.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.460
The Heaven-Halo Technique can
make energy channels vibrate,

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:54.300
allowing

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.330
the casters' minds to be exchanged.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.860
This is a way to obtain the divine body
to become a god.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:01.670
The Tianren Realm had taken

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:02.870
so many people's luck

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.910
to ascend to heaven from Gumo State.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.870
Now it's just karma coming full circle.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.200
The plague is raging now.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.120
If you do this,

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.920
what about those common people?

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:15.750
You're too naive.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.670
The plague isn't real.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:19.440
Everyone's been lying to you.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.640
I've broken free from control?

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:32.750
The remaining Tianren Realm power

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:33.610
in the bracelet

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.330
helped stabilize my energy channels.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:36.260
Get out!

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.270
The State Deity killed the King!

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:51.360
Catch him quickly!

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:52.600
Get him!

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:55.730
Our ascension plan failed!

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.510
He's trying to prevent us all

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:58.720
from ascending to heaven.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:16:59.440
He's the one who made us

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.700
unable to become gods!

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:02.030
Only by burning him to death

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.830
can we prevent his revenge on us!

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.790
The fire burned for three whole days.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.440
My body festered and healed
over and over again.

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:15.800
At that moment, I realized

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:18.270
that places outside the Tianren Realm are

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.000
crawling with worthless,

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.790
inferior, and foolish beings.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.069
They shouldn't exist.

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:27.880
Only through slaughter

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.170
can they be completely purified.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.310
This is true compassion.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.920
Ye Mo! Ye Mo!

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:45.680
I came too late.

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:47.680
How hypocritical.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.130
You're just utilizing me,

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.750
like your father did.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:52.930
That's not true.

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:54.070
I'm sorry.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.720
I really didn't know

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.320
this was my father's scheme.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.780
You wanted me
to open the Heaven Halo

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.110
to purify the ley lines.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:02.920
Fine then.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:05.920
I know what to do now.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.600
What needs
to be purified isn't the plague,

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.350
but their sins.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.570
Heaven being centered,

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.120
stars align.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.260
Earth being centered,

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.810
yin and yang harmonize.

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:38.530
From now on, I shall be called

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:41.180
Yique Yinyang.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.380
Holy Son of the Tianren Realm,

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.030
have you

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.880
seen clearly?

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:52.880
Someday,

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.020
you'll also need to make a choice,

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:57.470
just like I did back then.

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:02.870
He deliberately

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.460
left these things for me

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:05.430
to see.

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:09.200
But how did he know

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.070
that I would come to Shenzhou

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:12.470
and that I'm the Holy Son?

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:14.920
Could it be

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.370
that Yique Yinyang is still alive?

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:19.830
He's been watching me all along?

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.320
Didn't expect this child

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:42.270
to actually

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.200
bring back the Glowing Meteorite.

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:48.920
We've got the medicine,

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.640
but the patient is missing.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.370
Where on earth did Foxy Tang go?

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:04.450
Never mind,

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.490
I'll go find him.

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.880
Mr. Tang.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:11.180
Chi Yun,

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.680
when will you learn

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.720
to be patient?

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:15.960
I was worried about you.

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:17.750
I'm fine.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:20.310
Senior,

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.300
may I have a word with you?

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:36.590
Senior, may I ask

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.530
about your relationship
with Yique Yinyang?

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:42.880
In a time-space rift

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.240
at Mount Baojing,

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:46.550
I saw a memory fragment

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:47.550
of Yique Yinyang.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.020
You've met Yique Yinyang before.

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:54.350
I am a personal maid

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:55.350
of Princess Xi Ya.

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:00.200
Let me guess.

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:02.000
Earlier, you were

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.260
hiding things from me,

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:04.960
but now you're being frank.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:06.260
Tianren Realm?

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:07.830
What place is that?

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:09.910
I've never heard of it.

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:11.050
It's because

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:13.740
you once planned to trap me

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.380
in the time-space rift at Mount Baojing,

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:16.440
but unexpectedly,

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:19.300
I made it back.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:25.640
You're quite smart.

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:26.960
And perceptive too.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:29.240
Not only did you make it back alive,

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.410
but you even managed

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:32.310
to get the Glowing Meteorite.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:33.160
Then, Senior, you can

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.290
start saving me now.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.000
I

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.440
won't save you.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.030
I only said this could

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:45.920
serve as an ingredient for your medicine.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.650
Never did I say I would save you.

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:51.260
I saw with my own eyes

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.370
how the Princess's compassion

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.110
allowed Yique Yinyang

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:56.680
to bring disaster upon the world.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.350
You and he share the same origin.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:59.270
Even if right now,

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:00.860
you still have some good intentions,

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.520
there's no guarantee that you won't be

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.210
consumed by evil thoughts someday,

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:06.270
turning into a second Yique Yinyang.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.190
I won't let this happen.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:09.850
Moreover,

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:12.970
you did hesitate between saving others

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.160
and saving yourself,

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:17.510
didn't you?

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.720
Can't believe

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.880
the world is so absurd

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.110
that it is even wrong for a person to try

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:31.240
to save his own life.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.960
As the Physician of Miracle,

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:40.270
you must've seen countless beings

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:42.130
struggling on the brink of death.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.810
I believe

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.750
the desire to survive is

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.120
a human instinct.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:50.030
Or is it

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:54.060
that everyone has the right to live

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:58.590
except for me?

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:14.160
Not just you,

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:18.260
even I have asked myself

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:19.740
whether I deserve

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:20.940
to live in this world.

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:22.960
But not until I saw

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.440
those memory fragments

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.510
did I realize

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.290
how terribly wrong I was.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.640
I should survive.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.090
Even

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:38.750
Ye Mo back then

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.020
deserved to survive, too.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.610
Yique Yinyang summoned heavenly fire

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:49.450
and slaughtered the Gumo State.

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:51.130
Are you trying to defend him?

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:52.850
I'm just thinking

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:55.120
how lucky I am compared to Ye Mo.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:23:59.270
Ye Mo

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:00.800
descended upon Gumo State,

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.270
so Yique Yinyang

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:03.930
came into being in this world.

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.070
And I was fortunate enough

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:08.330
that Fang Zhou took me in at Zhoudi Tower.

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:09.940
That's why even now,

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:12.350
I can still be Tang Lici.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.830
You're simply trying to say

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:15.720
that you're not like him.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.570
But they didn't deserve to die, right?

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:18.490
Yet they were indeed

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:20.070
the ones who created Yique Yinyang.

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:21.930
But you feel compassion for them.

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:24.390
What about Fang Zhou?

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:26.440
What do you mean?

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:30.760
Senior,

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.160
even if you still think

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.960
that I deserve to die,

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.800
Fang Zhou's heart crystal is

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:40.840
inside my body now.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.680
If you kill me,

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:44.000
you'll be killing

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.200
the world's most honorable gentleman,

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:48.050
the Seven‑String True Tune,

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.050
Fang Zhou.

00:24:58.610 --> 00:24:59.870
Come here in three days

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.120
for the medicine.

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:27.190
Ms. Zhong, this way,

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.720
please.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.640
What's this?

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.360
The Princess's swaddling clothes
from when she was little.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.640
Her Highness has kept them all these years

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.700
to comfort her longing for her child.

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:52.200
Her Highness misses her daughter dearly

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.550
and has already come here.

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:55.280
Ms. Zhong, please get changed.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.120
Miss,

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:48.530
these ornaments...

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.440
Are they all

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.680
for me to wear?

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:53.970
Ms. Zhong, compared to your noble status,

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:55.350
these items to be used on you are

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:56.410
nothing precious.

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:58.370
Let me dress your hair.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:14.670
Your Highness.

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:27.860
My child!

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.200
My child.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:32.780
Your Highness.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:35.590
My child!

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:39.210
I've finally found you.

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:42.970
I've missed you so much.

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:53.400
My child.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.240
You've suffered so much.

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.460
Your father and I have failed you.

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:02.380
Don't worry.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:04.350
From now on, I will

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.480
do everything to protect you,

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:08.230
love you,

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.640
and give you everything you want.

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:23.150
Mother.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.680
Good girl.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.480
The medicine is ready.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.110
There are three pills in total.

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:12.070
Each one can extend your life once.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:13.640
Take it,

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:15.000
and your martial powers will be restored

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.140
as if nothing happened.

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:18.200
Your hair will also turn black again.

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:20.070
But there are only three pills.

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:21.150
Once you consume them all,

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:22.680
no one can save you anymore.

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:25.510
I understand.

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:33.610
I have one more condition.

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:36.850
Please go ahead, Senior.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.440
I want to go with you
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.130
I must

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:41.870
keep an eye on my patient.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:44.880
That's great.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:46.760
The Sword Alliance

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:49.060
will give you the warmest welcome.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:09.440
I'm back!

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.270
Come on,

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.240
come welcome me.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.180
Where is everyone?

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:41.480
Where are they?

00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:57.850
Senior, this way.

00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:58.710
Here they come.

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:02.840
Master Shao,

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:03.750
Mr. Tang has brought

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:05.480
the Physician of Miracle back.

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:07.890
So you're that...

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:09.960
This is the Physician of Miracle,

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:10.680
Shui Duopo.

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:13.030
So you're the renowned Senior Shui Duopo.

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:14.030
My apologies.

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:16.870
Look at yourself.

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:18.710
How can you call me "Senior"?

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.950
It's okay.

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.460
With your leg in such a terrible state,

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:28.920
just skip the formalities

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:29.790
and sit down.

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:31.010
Sit down, please.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.750
Is Mr. Tang fully recovered?

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:35.950
He's doing very well.

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:37.830
Then, Miss Shui,

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.820
please check on Master Puzhu.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.650
Don't worry.

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:41.640
As long as his leg is still attached,

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.700
I can fix it anyway.

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:44.630
Thank you, Senior Shui.

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.150
By the way, Master Shao,

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:47.310
Mr. Tang has already set off

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:48.240
for Wanhua Hall.

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:50.280
Then let's go to Wanhua Hall

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:52.430
and leave Miss Shui to the treatment.

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:54.060
Please.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:11.690
Liu Yan,

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:14.670
I'll send you up first with the red silk.

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:15.330
Otherwise,

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:16.310
both of us

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:17.350
will die here.

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:21.530
Do you really think

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:24.030
that our seven years of friendship were

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:25.310
something I faked

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.440
day after day?

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:33.240
If what Tang Lici said is true,

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:34.880
then what's the point

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.280
of everything I've done?

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.880
Master!

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.030
Master!

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:43.550
I've been refining
these Thousand Curse Needles every day,

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:44.880
but what's the point?

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.660
Master, what are you saying?

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:47.460
What's wrong?

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:55.000
While you were

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:56.760
looking for Senior Shui Duopo,

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:57.470
we found out

00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.730
that the person behind the Fengliu Shop is

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:00.990
called Ghostly Peony.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:05.720
What?

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:06.980
You know him?

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:13.780
I once ran into him

00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:14.890
in Sanqin.

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:17.640
How may I address you?

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:19.610
Ghostly Peony.

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:22.970
When I was trying to kill Yu Qifeng

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:24.380
at Xiuyu Peony Pavilion,

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:28.790
a teenage boy

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:31.700
came out of nowhere and rescued Yu Qifeng.

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:34.810
You acted on impulse

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:36.540
and nearly ruined everything.

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:38.770
He sounded

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.680
exactly like Ghostly Peony,

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:42.200
yet his physique

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:44.090
didn't seem human.

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:45.310
Perhaps

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:46.980
it was a puppet.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.710
When Chi Yun chased Fang Pingzhai

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:53.780
to Buhuan Tower,

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:55.480
he also found a puppet

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.360
giving orders to Qiaoyi Qiankun.

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:01.000
According to the captured disciples
of Fengliu Shop,

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.190
they often saw Liu Yan

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:04.440
having secret talks
with an opera performer.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.320
They heard Liu Yan call this person

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.030
Leader.

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:09.520
An opera performer?

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:12.670
Godfather,

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:14.840
Liu Yan's been
acting weird since he returned

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:15.969
from Mount Baojing.

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:17.620
Judging by his expression,

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:18.620
something's off.

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:37.770
Did I scare you?

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:39.710
No.

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:41.100
This isn't fun.

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:42.489
Is Liu Yan

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:43.739
going to leave?

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.560
Why is he leaving all of a sudden?

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.050
He wants to get rid of my surveillance.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:51.320
Why does he want to get rid

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:52.580
of your surveillance?

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:54.360
What is he planning?

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.290
Every time he meets with Tang Lici,

00:34:58.110 --> 00:34:59.760
he gets a bit weirder.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:01.840
It seems

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:04.940
that I need to move up my plan.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:10.260
Fang Pingzhai!

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:11.520
I've finished making the things

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.180
that Fang Pingzhai asked for.

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:19.560
Sword Master Shao Yanping
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:23.290
and Guest of Honor, Tang Lici,
please receive the imperial decree.

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:24.740
I, Tang Lici...

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:28.350
-I, Shao Yanping, receive the decree.
-Receive the decree.

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:30.910
By heaven's will

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.440
and sacred rites,

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:33.760
here's the imperial decree.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.280
His Majesty's daughter,
Princess Lang Ya, was

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.610
lost in chaos
like a pearl covered in dust.

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.900
Fortunately, with heaven's blessing

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:43.700
and the help
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:45.720
we were reunited.

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.140
Sword Master Shao Yanping
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.740
nurtured the Princess
with great dedication.

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:53.750
He is hereby granted 500 taels of gold,

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:54.980
a bushel of pearls,

00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:56.940
and the right to enter court
without bowing

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:58.270
or handing in his sword.

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:01.060
He is bestowed the title,
"Imperial Princess's Preceptor."

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:03.190
Tang Lici, Master of Wanqiao Chamber,

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:04.930
saved the Princess.

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:08.460
He is appointed
as the Court Gentleman for Consultation.

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:13.330
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:17.190
Master Shao.

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:25.220
Everyone, please rise.

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:30.780
Master Shao.

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:31.330
Yes.

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:34.140
This time,

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.960
His Majesty is so pleased to have

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.490
his beloved daughter back.

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:40.770
These are exceptional rewards
for the Sword Alliance.

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:41.430
As you know,

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.370
according to our agreement,

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:45.880
the court and jianghu
do not interfere with each other.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.340
So in the future, it will still be that

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.550
jianghu matters are
only settled in the jianghu.

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:50.550
But rest assured.

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:51.900
This time, the court

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:53.830
will send more forces to assist you

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:55.710
in destroying the Fengliu Shop.

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:56.240
However,

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.060
we still need to rely

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:59.470
on the power
of your Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:00.400
I understand.

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.990
Everyone,

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.970
out of deep concern about the Princess,

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:06.970
His Majesty has specially sent
the imperial palace's top martial artist,

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:09.040
General Yuchi, to assist you.

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:11.330
I've met with you all before.

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:13.460
My mission is to protect the Princess.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.370
Though I'm in the Sword Alliance,

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:16.160
I only obey

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:17.650
the Princess's commands.

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:19.700
That won't do.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.140
You also need to listen
to my master and Mr. Tang.

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:24.610
Master.

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:27.030
I have something to tell you.

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:31.140
Mind the etiquette.

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:32.880
I almost forgot

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.480
that you're a princess now.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:35.460
So, would you like

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:36.980
to find a better master?

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:39.580
How could I ever
think of changing my master?

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:40.580
Look at you.

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:42.010
Don't be shy.

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:44.000
You used to be so unruly and carefree.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.200
I'm just teasing you.

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:47.540
Can't you tell that?

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.760
Your joke isn't

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.510
funny at all.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:54.840
By the way, Master,

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.280
I've already informed His Majesty

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:56.880
that I'll continue serving

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:57.960
as the Shanfeng Branch Chief

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.960
to assist you at the Sword Alliance.

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:00.670
Why?

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:03.870
I won't forget your kindness

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:06.030
in raising me.

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:09.200
The Sword Alliance needs people now.

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:11.440
How could I leave?

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:13.150
Great.

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:14.740
I'm so happy.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.800
I can finally be

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.060
of help to you, Master.

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:24.820
Come here.

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:28.010
Godfather.

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:30.450
Where is Palace Chief Wanyu?

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:33.310
He has already returned to Biluo Palace.

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:34.840
His Majesty heard

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:36.220
that Biluo Palace

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:37.450
played a crucial role

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.220
in rescuing the Princess.

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:39.880
Therefore,

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:43.180
he's been appointed as Chief Diviner
of the Imperial Observatory

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.610
and summoned to the capital
to meet His Majesty immediately.

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:46.610
Lici, you know,

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:49.010
I originally planned
to slack off and deliver

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:49.900
all the imperial decrees

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:51.160
at the Sword Alliance.

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:52.410
Now I'll have to ask you to pass on

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:53.430
the message to him.

00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.910
Okay.

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:55.700
Lici.

00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:59.700
The person
you asked me to investigate last time is

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:01.410
a prince from the previous dynasty.

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:02.530
If you know them,

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:04.380
don't get too deeply involved.

00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:06.690
I see, Godfather.

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:08.930
You've always been prudent
in handling things.

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:10.740
I'm just giving you a small heads-up.

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:11.670
I can rest at ease

00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:13.340
so long as you're aware of it.

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:13.970
Okay.

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:17.130
Mr. Tang.

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:24.180
Thank you.

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:28.010
If you hadn't written
to the Empress's father,

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:29.660
I couldn't have been

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:31.270
found by my mother

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:33.160
and become a princess.

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:35.460
Princess,

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:37.330
please don't mention it.

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.150
No need for formalities, Mr. Tang.

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:43.300
To be honest,

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.450
finding the lost imperial scion was

00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:47.340
what I should do.

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:49.050
I feel

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.030
so happy for you.

00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:57.530
It's been a while

00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:59.590
since I had your dumplings last time.

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:00.970
You must be tired from your journey.

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:02.500
You're looking better now.

00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:03.930
You too.

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.000
By the way,

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:06.190
where is Mr. Tang?

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:08.820
Mr. Tang is escorting Minister Tang
down the mountain.

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:09.750
Long time no see.

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:11.180
I've missed you all so much.

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:12.380
I've missed you, too.

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.220
Chi, Shen,

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:17.050
look who's here.

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:21.740
Seeing you in this outfit,

00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:23.840
I'm really not used to it.

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:24.740
Not just you,

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:27.180
even I'm not quite used to it myself.

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:29.090
These clothes look really beautiful.

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:29.700
From now on,

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.090
you should always dress like this.

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:31.700
Really?

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:35.340
Beautiful.

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.220
Thank you, Stone.

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:39.570
By the way,

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.490
during your visit to the imperial palace,

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:43.180
didn't the Emperor give you

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:45.700
any rewards?

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:47.990
Now that you mention it...

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:49.320
I have a gift

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.320
for Shen.

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:51.610
Me?

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:07.530
Violet Jade?

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:08.580
What's that?

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:11.960
The jade
from the Seven-Treasure Jade Hairpin.

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.220
I know Shen

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:15.260
has been looking for it all these years.

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:16.180
As it happens,

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:17.180
I heard it was taken back

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:18.570
to the imperial palace two years ago.

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:19.090
So

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:20.820
I asked my father for it.

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:22.530
Thank you.

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:24.610
It's so sweet of you, Princess.

00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:25.610
Don't mention it.

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:28.740
Shen, you're so lucky.

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:30.440
Such a treasure...

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:34.830
Such a treasure is too good

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:36.210
for someone like you.

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:37.090
While someone like me is

00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:39.380
still empty-handed. It's not good, is it?

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:40.380
What do you think?

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:41.940
What should I say?

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:43.900
I mean,

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:46.610
Princess, you've come from afar

00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:48.570
and must be very tired.

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:50.740
Is there more?

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:52.660
Well,

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:53.610
I brought you a bolt

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:55.010
of deep red celestial silk,

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:56.860
plus a pair of matching bracelets.

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.650
Don't say I'm playing favorites.

00:42:58.650 --> 00:42:59.850
I'm not a princess.

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:02.110
Why did you bring these for me?

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:03.220
The celestial silk is

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:04.900
made by the imperial palace's craftsmen.

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:06.070
Embroidered with gold thread,

00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:06.990
it'll make

00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:08.850
the most amazing wedding dress
in the world.

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:10.290
As for these matching bracelets,

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:11.820
if worn by a married couple,

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:14.460
they respond to each other
when they're close.

00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:16.130
Give one of them to Miss Bai.

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:17.660
She'll definitely like it.

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:18.780
You truly are

00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:19.670
my best friend.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.730
I forgot you're a princess now.

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:28.870
I also brought gifts for Miss Shei,

00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:30.090
Stone, Mr. Tang,

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:31.210
and Gu Xitan.

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:32.540
Thank you, Princess.

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:35.740
Where is Gu Xitan?

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:47.740
What are you doing?

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:49.030
Why don't you go in?

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:49.860
Senior.

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:52.390
Why do I feel

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:53.960
that Zhong has changed

00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:55.780
since she came back?

00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:57.650
She's now a princess.

00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:58.740
Aren't you happy?

00:43:59.090 --> 00:43:59.740
No.

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:01.510
Of course I'm happy.

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:03.570
Before Zhong joined the Sword Alliance,

00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:04.630
she suffered a lot.

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:05.740
Now she has not only found

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:06.570
her parents

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:08.340
but also become a princess

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:09.400
loved by everyone.

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:11.490
Someone as strong-willed as her

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:13.820
has finally stepped into a bright future.

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:15.550
How could I not be happy for her?

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:17.020
But

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:20.100
she's drifting away from me.
