[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.900
[Episode 25]

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.480
Miss Tao.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.259
Why did you join the Fengliu Shop?

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.200
Miss Tao's talent, appearance,

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.810
wisdom,

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.620
and martial skills

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.220
are all top-tier in this era.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.340
Why did you join the Fengliu Shop?

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.120
Sir, are you trying

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.520
to compliment my beauty?

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.759
You certainly possess

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:52.960
beauty to be proud of.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.400
But that is not my question.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.950
After being friends for so many years,

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.900
you've only now decided
to have a heart-to-heart with me.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:03.790
But if you want to know

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.120
someone else's secret,

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.310
shouldn't you

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.840
reveal your own first?

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.630
I was, in fact,

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.110
the crown prince of the former dynasty.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.650
The current emperor

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.000
is my cousin.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.710
You were the crown prince
of the former dynasty?

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.120
The chaos caused by Yique Yinyang

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.520
began because my father trusted traitors.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.500
Though I was the crown prince,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.180
I failed to stop my father.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.670
I could only watch helplessly

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.020
as people suffered terribly.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.970
Hundreds of thousands of lives were lost.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.560
Even if only a fraction of the blame
were mine,

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.090
I could never atone for it.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.520
That is why

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.180
I joined the Tianjing Pavilion
for cultivation.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.290
Then you have even more reason to kill me.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.640
Only by killing me
can you save more people.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.900
You are using your life as bait

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.870
just to see me

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.630
fall from grace?

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.520
For someone like you,

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.260
with such an unyielding will,

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.370
the sound of your collapse

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.640
will surely be clear and resounding.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.360
While cultivating
in the Tianjing Pavilion,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.280
because I regretted my own

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.079
inability to save those people,

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.520
my inner demon ran wild,

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.490
and I almost lost control.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.260
It was my master who told me

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.190
that every person

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.120
should have

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.380
a chance to start anew.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.150
I am,

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.190
among all those still living,

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.610
the one who deserves death the most.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:58.520
If I don't die,

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.560
then others certainly shouldn't.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.210
If I cannot forgive others,

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.710
I certainly cannot forgive myself.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.690
You always wear that bracelet.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.230
Perhaps there's still goodness in you.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.400
Master Puzhu,

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.519
what's inside these beads

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.040
is deadly poison—

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.800
cinnabar.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.050
It can be poison,

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.130
but it can also be medicine.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.730
It all depends on your intention.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.810
What are you doing?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
If you died here,

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.800
I'd be responsible for your death.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:46.960
My legs are injured,

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.630
but my inner energy remains.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.000
If I heal your wounds,

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.980
you can escape.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.180
Don't forget,

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.560
I'm the West Palace Chief
of the Fengliu Shop.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.420
I'm not trying to convert anyone.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.290
I just don't want
any more blood on my hands.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.720
If you commit evil again,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.580
others will surely deal with you.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.800
But by then,

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:07.480
it may no longer be

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.140
something I can intervene in.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.190
In the battle at the Peony Pavilion,

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.050
Xifang Tao did not show up either.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.190
Either she and Master Puzhu

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:26.510
are still

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.420
locked in combat,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.800
or

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.320
they've made peace.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.920
Although we still

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.840
haven't found Master Puzhu,

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.870
in my view,

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.680
he and Xifang Tao

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.450
should both still be alive.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.210
You fought in such a fierce battle.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.670
Why didn't anyone call me?

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.480
How's the task

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.680
I asked you to do?

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.630
You won't believe it!

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:03.600
I'm telling you,

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.000
good thing I went myself.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.970
We'll talk about it later.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.580
I'll take my leave now.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:16.220
Let's go.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.000
My journey

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.920
can only be described

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.560
as legendary.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.310
I've been through endless hardship,

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.680
dealing with all kinds of creatures,

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.940
to complete your task.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.659
Let's just say—

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:36.220
my brains saved me.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.390
I'm lucky to be alive to report back.

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:39.750
Guess who I ran into

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:40.600
at the Fallen Shisan Tower?

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.720
Qiaoyi Qiankun.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:42.870
How did you know?

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.020
Were you secretly tailing me?

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:46.320
Wait.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.340
Weren't you busy fighting
at the Peony Pavilion?

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.070
Fang Pingzhai has always been
full of wild ideas.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.630
In this world, the only person

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.270
willing to daydream like him

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:56.310
must be

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.240
the equally crazy Qiaoyi Qiankun.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.160
Whether it's Fang Pingzhai

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.390
or Qiaoyi Qiankun,

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.910
to the Fengliu Shop,

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.030
the two of them

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.780
are, at best, outside helpers.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.190
The one truly pulling the strings
behind all this

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.520
is likely someone else.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.680
You have a point.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.490
Then I bet you don't know

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.490
who brought Qiaoyi Qiankun there.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.870
A child.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.120
The task is done.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.590
Where's the thing I want?

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.159
As long as you hand it over,

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:33.560
things like defying fate

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.830
or turning back time won't be a problem.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.070
Qiaoyi Qiankun seemed to have

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.930
just rushed over from somewhere.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.000
I followed them to the Shisan Tower

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.430
and overheard them talking.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.159
I didn't understand

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:43.110
what they were saying,

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.680
but I could tell

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.080
it wasn't anything good.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.310
Something about miracles,

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.159
turning things upside down,

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:48.159
and defying fate.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:48.870
Also,

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:49.870
that child was able to make

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.240
Qiaoyi Qiankun take him so seriously,

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.570
which is quite strange.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.230
But you were right about one thing—

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.960
Fang Pingzhai really is crazy.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.270
Behind Liu Yan,

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:02.930
there is indeed someone else.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.750
He's so foolish to be manipulated

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:10.410
and yet think he's in control.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:13.510
Mr. Yu?

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:25.480
I…

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.840
have something
to discuss with Mr. Tang privately.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.590
Since when did you two

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.440
become so close?

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.549
What secret can't I hear?

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.169
Fine, talk all you want.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.169
I'm going to eat.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:43.169
Shei made dinner.

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:44.030
Come back soon.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.010
Got it.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.650
What is it you want to discuss, Mr. Yu?

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:56.030
Why…

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.800
didn't you expose me?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.930
What do you mean?

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.320
Back at Xiuyu Peony Pavilion,

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.200
I stabbed you.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.030
I hated you for using Sword King City.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.430
I had always doubted you.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:10.870
I wanted revenge.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:12.320
You knew that.

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:20.320
You only wanted

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.520
revenge, that's all.

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:23.010
If I were you,

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.150
I'd want revenge too.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.240
In the jianghu,

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.630
revenge knows no right or wrong.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:30.600
Tang Lici.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:32.910
You keep showing kindness

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.200
to an enemy.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.370
What is it you really want?

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:38.510
In the jianghu,

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:40.080
I have more enemies

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:41.550
than fish in a river.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.080
Why would I

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.540
show kindness to an enemy?

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.930
If your heart were truly set,

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:48.590
if revenge was all you wanted,

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:49.600
then why,

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.870
after that strike,

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.600
did you stop?

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.120
And why didn't you join the Fengliu Shop

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.550
with Yu Qifeng?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.260
Instead, you came back

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.960
to the Sword Alliance.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.480
Mr. Yu.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.120
That sword strike of yours

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.480
meant nothing

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.750
to me.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.610
The Yanhuang Sword?

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:28.080
How did it

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.750
end up with you?

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:31.720
Back at Sword King City,

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:33.150
thanks to this sword,

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:34.700
the poisonous creature could be

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.360
suppressed within 500 zhang.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:39.010
The city was thus saved
from complete ruin.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:41.360
You truly do not need to credit me

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.690
with that achievement.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.150
But…

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:48.420
if you cannot unleash this sword's power,

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.870
then you don't

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.000
even have the right

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.550
to speak of forgiving me.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.010
Mr. Tang, you're here.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.790
Master Shao, you wished to see me.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.520
Is there something important?

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:31.200
Sit.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.750
It's just the two of us here.

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:34.510
Here.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.940
No need to keep up the act.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.240
This…

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:44.600
That blood you swallowed back
in the Wanhua Hall—

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.830
you can spit it out now.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:46.710
I just did.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.390
I'm not that fragile.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:51.640
Thank you.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.240
This battle has

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.680
greatly weakened the Sword Alliance.

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:57.840
The Fengliu Shop

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.320
suffered heavy losses too.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.250
They'll have to lie low for a while.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.480
So, right now, there's something else

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.000
that's far more important.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:05.720
Mr. Tang,

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.510
the injuries you got at Biluo Palace

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.030
haven't fully healed, have they?

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.960
At the Peony Pavilion this time,

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.480
you were hurt again.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.480
That's why

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:13.960
finding a great physician

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.670
to restore your strength

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.220
is of utmost importance.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.150
After all, the peace of the jianghu

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:21.820
rests entirely on you.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:23.910
I

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.270
can't possibly carry such a burden.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:31.840
Mr. Tang,

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.370
you may not
have come for peace in the jianghu,

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:35.840
but I'll hand over Liu Yan

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.120
for you to deal with.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:44.810
As expected,

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:46.480
Master Shao, you know well

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.720
how to negotiate.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.000
You flatter me.

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:51.280
Mr. Tang, focus on healing.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.600
As for the Sword Alliance's affairs,

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.460
leave them to me

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.120
and the other sword masters.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:56.670
However,

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.880
great physicians mostly

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:00.430
live in seclusion.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:02.320
Even if I want to find one,

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.510
there's nowhere to start looking.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:05.720
Don't worry about that.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.920
From what I've heard,

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.240
within our Sword Alliance,

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.440
there's actually someone

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.630
who's an old friend
of the incredible physician Shui Duopo.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.670
If we can invite her

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:15.870
to the Sword Alliance,

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:17.550
that would be ideal.

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:26.260
The mountain wind's a bit chilly tonight.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.240
Have I

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:29.280
caught a cold?

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:37.270
Master Shao.

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:38.170
Mr. Tang.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.630
-Master Shao.
-Master Shao.

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:47.830
-Mr. Tang.
-Mr. Tang.

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:48.980
Chang,

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.030
you've been practicing well lately.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.030
I just saw you practicing.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:53.240
You need to raise your arm

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.360
to make your punch more powerful.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.080
Am I right?

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:56.630
Qi, you've grown taller.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.780
Almost as tall
as your third senior brother.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:00.720
Bao,

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.510
yesterday I saw you

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.240
throw away the green vegetables

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.100
from your meal.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.720
Don't think I didn't notice.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.120
So Master Shao,
you found me out after all.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:10.080
Of course I did.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.640
You really do
notice everything, Master Shao.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.080
We'll head to bed then.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.100
Go on, go to bed.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.790
Let's go.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.150
Young people these days

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.950
really should get out more

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.920
and spend some time with friends

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.610
instead of staying cooped up inside.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:37.670
Chunji,

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.870
the kitchen made roast chicken tonight.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:40.670
It smells amazing.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:41.550
Have you eaten?

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.260
You need to eat something.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.700
That's how your wounds will heal faster.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:46.870
Master,

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.410
I've already eaten.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.360
Chunji.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.790
What happened at the Peony Pavilion
wasn't your fault.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:59.600
Master,

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.030
I'm tired.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:02.320
Alright.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.540
Get some rest then.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:13.440
So,

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.910
your worry

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:17.720
is about Ms. Zhong.

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:21.080
I knew you'd figure it out.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.870
That's why you deliberately

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.050
brought me here.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:27.840
You saw it too.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.840
Chunji has locked herself up

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:29.910
in her room,

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:31.120
not eating or drinking,

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.190
and not speaking to the other disciples.

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:34.270
Everyone's already

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:35.080
stopped blaming her.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.550
But she just can't get over

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:37.950
that hurdle in her heart.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.590
She won't forgive herself.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:42.510
Mr. Tang,

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:43.480
she…

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:44.840
You…

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:46.390
Don't worry, Master Shao.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.360
I understand.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.090
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.180
Why did they even save her?

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.000
She's the one who caused all this!

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.240
What can we do?

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:26.200
She is

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.000
Master Shao's disciple after all.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:28.750
If we'd followed

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:30.110
Mr. Tang's original plan,

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:31.270
the Peony Pavilion battle

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.200
wouldn't have cost
the Sword Alliance so dearly.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.270
Yet she still wants
to return to Shanfeng Branch.

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:36.270
Delusional!

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.630
Yes, delusional!

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.480
Delusional!

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.000
Stop blaming me.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.200
Why save her at all?

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.160
She's the one who caused it!

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.750
Stop blaming me!

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.480
Just leave it at the door.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.270
Ms. Zhong.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.040
Mr. Tang.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.290
Do you have a moment?

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.170
Please, come in.

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:02.440
Mr. Tang,

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.370
you saved me at the Peony Pavilion.

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:05.750
I should have properly

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:06.950
thanked you for that.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:08.920
But right now,

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:11.320
I really don't know how to face…

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:13.790
face you.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.680
Because of me,

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:17.240
the Peony Pavilion battle

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.550
caused heavy losses.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:19.310
All of this…

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:20.400
The losses

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.730
we suffered in that battle…

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:24.640
if someone must

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.370
take responsibility for them,

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:27.640
it should be me, as the one

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.070
who led the charge.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.030
Ms. Zhong,

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.400
you don't have to

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.730
shoulder all the blame.

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:36.310
Besides,

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:39.110
when we decided
to attack Xiuyu Peony Pavilion,

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:41.310
everyone in the Sword Alliance
was excited.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:42.830
No one objected.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.550
Mr. Tang, you're always like this.

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:52.110
Your words of comfort

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.100
won't make me feel any better.

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:00.480
I did not

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:02.030
come here

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.200
to comfort you.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:04.440
I came because

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.550
the Sword Alliance
is in need of talented people.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:08.810
We need you, Ms. Zhong.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.310
I'll be leaving tomorrow,

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.000
and I'd like to go

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:17.480
with peace of mind.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.550
I believe

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.510
Master Shao feels the same.

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:26.480
Do you really think…

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.470
the Sword Alliance still needs me?

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:33.200
Ms. Zhong, you hadn't made

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.930
any major mistakes in the past,

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.150
so you'd never learned from one.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.550
I do have some experience.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:44.750
I once

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.270
took a wrong step…

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:51.680
and caused

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.030
irreparable regret.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.280
All I could do was bear the mistake,

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.450
walking through darkness,

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:04.270
one step at a time.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.330
Because there was no other choice.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:09.270
But

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:11.800
if you let that consume you,

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:14.720
that would be the true betrayal

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.960
of the dead.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:18.400
So,

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.160
the more you carry,

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:24.760
the more you must move forward.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:26.680
Carrying such a heavy burden,

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:29.930
won't one easily stumble

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:32.630
and be laughed at?

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.850
If you stumble, get back up.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.140
If people laugh at you,

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:39.880
let them.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.080
When the light finally shines through,

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.790
all those past hardships

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:47.690
will be nothing

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:49.960
but a little frost on your journey.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.550
But who can truly do that?

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:54.190
Who can do it?

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:13.340
The Ms. Zhong I once knew—

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.440
she surely could.

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:32.920
It's late.

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:34.160
I'll

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.710
take my leave now.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:53.730
Thank you,

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:55.950
Mr. Tang.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:15.590
Those bastards from the Sword Alliance

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:18.110
really destroyed
most of the Peony Pavilion.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:19.000
Damn them.

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:24.410
You blind animal!

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:26.350
Fucui,

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.200
how dare you!

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.010
Greetings, Leader.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.310
Every plant in the Plum Garden

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:35.560
is not to be touched.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.530
Even plucking a single leaf

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:39.160
will cost you your life.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:41.960
Yes.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.480
Bai Suche,

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.550
the Black Tulili I asked you to gather—

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:47.410
how is it going?

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.450
It's done.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:13.400
I went out and came back,

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.440
and you still haven't made up your mind?

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.040
Only patience wins the game.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:20.830
Hurry up.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.700
Stop complaining.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.720
Master, you left behind
this unfinished game.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.270
Leader, you once said

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:55.400
the Fengliu Shop
doesn't belong to me alone.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.300
Leader, you must

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.560
also bear your share of responsibility.

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:04.280
You're right.

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:08.720
At this very moment,

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.820
you still have the mood to play Go?

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.020
The Peony Pavilion may be destroyed,

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:15.290
but the Sword Alliance

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.440
has also suffered greatly.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.240
Both sides need time to recover.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.160
So we'll withdraw our forces for now

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.760
to rest and regain strength.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:24.970
This is a game of strategy.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.460
The Go game is the same.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.570
The pleasure of the game lies in

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:30.760
the moment the winner is revealed.

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:32.270
Some win

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.720
by sheer luck;

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.400
others

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.160
by careful calculation.

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:39.870
Some will even pay any price,

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.010
losing everything they have,

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.160
yet still claim

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.440
the art of the game

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.290
is to play moderately for amusement.

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:47.750
Without the desire to win,

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.320
one can avoid obsession.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.100
Without the desire to win,

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.400
you'll never win.

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:06.960
Without obsession,

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:08.760
one cannot achieve greatness.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:09.750
Look,

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:10.930
you've lost.

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.110
This is the thrill of victory

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:22.910
and the sting of defeat?

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.510
How come I've lost

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.600
but don't feel upset?

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.090
Please, Master, focus on healing.

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.720
She's one of the Fengliu Shop's
key fighters.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.780
The defeated soldiers you brought back

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.310
are nowhere near her worth.

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:50.080
Did Xifang Tao run away?

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:52.680
Should we call her Xifang Fled now?

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:53.720
That joke

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:54.780
isn't funny at all.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:25:59.550
No one…

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:04.200
can escape the grasp of the Fengliu Shop.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.240
Palace Chief,

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.050
you're leaving so soon?

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.880
Why don't you stay a few more days?

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:26.510
I hadn't left Biluo Palace

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:27.370
for a long time.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.730
Being out for so long this time—

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.530
I'm still not used to it.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.110
The battle at the Peony Pavilion

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:37.310
was a narrow victory.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.650
Everyone in the Sword Alliance

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:41.320
owes thanks to Biluo Palace

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.970
for stepping in to help.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:45.590
However,

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:48.310
I imagine what concerns you most now

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:49.400
is not that,

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.030
but rather

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.080
the court's attitude toward Biluo Palace.

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:55.960
Of course,

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.200
that concerns me.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:58.590
But

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.450
what interests me even more

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.840
is your change, Mr. Tang.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.770
In just a few short days,

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:07.830
your heart has changed completely.

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:09.750
The Mr. Tang standing before me now

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:11.410
seems more willing to open up.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.280
Palace Chief,

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.660
peering into someone's heart

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.440
isn't exactly a good habit.

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:29.880
I've already sent a message
to my godfather

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.110
to inform His Majesty

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.410
of Biluo Palace's contributions.

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:38.430
Thank you.

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:40.640
That was our agreement.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.370
"Poor teaching"

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:46.310
"reflects the teacher's laziness."

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:47.810
"If a child doesn't study,"

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:48.870
"it is not proper."

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.960
"If one doesn't learn when young,"

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.560
"what will they do when old?"

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.740
"If jade is uncut,"

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:55.270
"it cannot become a useful vessel."

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:56.470
"If you don't learn,"

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:57.630
"you won't know..."

00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:59.010
"Righteousness."

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.030
"If you don't learn,"

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:01.240
"you won't know righteousness."

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.240
You forgot again?

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:03.510
"If you don't learn,"

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:05.790
"you won't know righteousness."

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:06.640
"As someone's child…"

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.170
It seems what I was curious about

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:09.700
has already been answered.

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.300
Foxy Tang still hasn't returned.

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.560
Your change, Mr. Tang,

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:15.680
is because of them.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.200
Are we eating or not?

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:16.590
No.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.270
Master hasn't returned.

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.600
No one is allowed to eat.

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:27.110
Shei's cooking is excellent.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.240
Palace Chief Wanyu,

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:29.160
why not stay

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.290
and have a simple meal before leaving?

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:33.550
No, thank you.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:34.680
Mr. Tang,

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.440
I believe we will

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.970
have a chance to meet again.

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:04.920
You've finally returned!

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:05.880
Sit.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.070
We've been waiting for ages.

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:08.600
I'm practically starving.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:09.880
Starving?

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:12.880
I don't mean to blame you,

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.480
but how could you fight

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:15.750
such a world-shaking battle

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:17.160
without me?

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.180
Weren't you starving?

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.960
What?

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:21.000
Not starving anymore?

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.070
It's all your fault!

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:23.240
Why did you have to send me

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.880
to keep a lookout at that exact time?

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:25.510
We're done!

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:26.590
It's over between us…

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:27.450
for 30 minutes.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.110
Senior Xue Xianzi is here.

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:37.270
Senior,

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:40.050
why do you keep popping up unexpectedly?

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.480
Master Shao said

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.530
only you know the way there.

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:45.730
They're… they're my chopsticks.

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:48.920
What way?

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:53.830
It's 30 minutes already?

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:54.960
Don't be a busybody.

00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:56.750
Where exactly are you going?

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.790
To go sightseeing,

00:29:58.790 --> 00:29:59.960
eat good food, and drink fine wine.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.360
And we're not taking you.

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.720
Shei's cooking is still so good.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.400
Senior...

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:09.900
Little fox,

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:12.040
now you know to call me Senior.

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:14.050
What do you mean, "Master Shao said"

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:15.420
"I know the way there"?

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.880
Truth is,

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.640
only I know the way there.

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:20.530
I wanted to ask, did you

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:21.510
pay back the interest

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:24.000
on the money you owe me from last month?

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:26.760
What interest?

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:27.860
What monthly interest?

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:28.590
I don't know.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.810
If you can't pay back the money,

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:32.740
what will you offer as collateral?

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.070
Alright.

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:36.800
Aren't you going
to Shui Duopo for treatment?

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.560
It's such a joyous thing.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.920
Talking about money ruins the mood.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.200
Shui Duopo, the incredible physician?

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:45.070
You're finally going

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:46.600
to treat your old injuries.

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.680
You must take me with you this time.

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:52.880
Master.

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:56.080
I want to go too.

00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:58.640
The journey is long.

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:00.090
You'd better not come.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.070
I am going.

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:05.030
When you went to the Peony Pavilion,

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:06.890
Stone was very worried about you.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.510
Was Stone the only one worried about him?

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:12.370
Besides Stone,

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.460
no one else was worried about him?

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:18.880
Little fox.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.730
How does it feel to have someone

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:22.720
worry about you?

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:24.680
Ever felt it before?

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:41.810
Then let's go together.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.350
Go eat.

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:55.110
Chi Yun.

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:56.510
Have another one.

00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:58.400
Shen.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:31:59.790
Eat.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:01.480
Try this.

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:02.420
Try it.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:03.410
Delicious.

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.310
Palace Chief, you're not in a hurry.

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:19.160
Why not stay

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.420
and dine with Mr. Tang?

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:21.890
Did you notice?

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.100
He's clearly in unbearable pain,

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:26.240
yet he keeps pretending to be fine.

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:29.480
You're talking about Mr. Tang?

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:31.420
But what does that have to do

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:32.420
with my question?

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.220
If I stayed any longer,

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:37.590
I wouldn't be able
to resist advising him again.

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:39.010
But he dislikes it when others

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:40.240
try to read his heart.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.160
So,

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:43.930
let's go.

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:41.480
My wound is healing so slowly.

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:53.230
Mr. Tang,

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:55.310
you're a monster too.

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:57.440
You should understand—

00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:59.020
to monsters like us,

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.640
redemption means everything.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.409
"Men at their birth"

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.580
"are naturally good."

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:23.230
Even monsters

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:25.650
have other choices in life.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.929
Power Transformation Technique?

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:41.110
Yique Yinyang,

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.300
this is how you tricked Fang Zhou,

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.070
using the rest of his life

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:47.860
to help you practice
the Rebirth Scroll, right?

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:48.800
"Joy, anger,"

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:50.270
"sorrow, fear,"

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.280
"love, hate, and desire"

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.480
"are the seven emotions of humans."

00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:55.190
Lici,

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.110
they're just ordinary people of Shenzhou.

00:34:58.110 --> 00:34:59.770
They have all seven emotions.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.930
They may grow angry because of this

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.330
and misunderstand you.

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:04.610
But I believed in you.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.000
Doesn't that prove

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:09.070
our seven years of friendship
at Zhoudi Tower

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:10.550
were real after all?

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.740
But the truth is,
those seven years at Zhoudi Tower

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:17.840
were built entirely on lies!

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:53.280
Here.

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.400
Eat more.

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.840
You eat so much, yet never grow bigger.

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:02.890
Foxy Tang is always punctual.

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.930
Didn't we agree to leave at dawn?

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:07.110
It's almost sunrise now,

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.730
and he's still not here.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:11.440
He's here.

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:15.110
[Tingyun Pavilion]

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:28.030
I felt relaxed,

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.070
so I

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:30.760
slept in a little.

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.070
Mr. Tang,

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:35.630
your hair…

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.400
Everyone's here.

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:43.530
Here is the map.

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:44.510
You can go on your own.

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:45.360
As for me…

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:47.440
You…

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:50.370
Little fox,

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:51.880
what happened to you?

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:53.080
Why is your hair grey?

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:54.880
Isn't this normal?

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:57.380
Yours is all white, Elder.

00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:58.140
Knock it off.

00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:59.750
I'm over 300 years old.

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:06.760
Paying one's debts
is only right and proper.

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:07.960
Since I owe you money,

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.230
I'll

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:10.830
escort you all the way there.

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:11.710
Shei and Stone

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:13.110
are waiting at the mountain gate.

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:13.640
Let's go.

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:14.530
Let's go, guys.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.050
Master Shao,

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:19.920
farewell.

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:22.230
Let's go.

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:02.110
Master Jiang?

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:05.750
What brings you here?

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:07.800
Chunji,

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:09.440
are you feeling better?

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:11.510
I came on behalf of other sword masters

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:12.950
to check on you.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:15.440
Chunji,

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:17.480
why are you still here?

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:20.030
Why not return to your room
at Shanfeng Branch?

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:20.920
I'm no longer

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.400
the chief of Shanfeng Branch.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:23.190
Nonsense.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.070
You've done so much

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:26.400
for the Sword Alliance.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.960
In the Xiuyu Peony Pavilion battle,

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.280
you led from the front

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.590
and risked your life
to save the disciples.

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:32.510
If anyone dares say

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:33.960
you're not the chief of Shanfeng Branch,

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.490
I'll be the first to object!

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:38.070
This room's far too small.

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:40.000
How can you recover properly here?

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:42.030
Go back to your room at Shanfeng Branch

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:43.290
and recover properly.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:43.960
Come in!

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.280
Help move Ms. Zhong's belongings.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:50.940
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:55.160
Careful, slow down.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:58.800
Master Jiang.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:01.230
What's going on?

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:03.680
You've always been Branch Chief Zhong.

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:05.840
In my heart, you always will be.

[Mount Baojing]

What kind of cursed weather is this?

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:29.840
Compared to my Snow-Return Storm,

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.800
it still falls a bit short.

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:35.230
Looks like

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:36.630
this snow won't stop

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:37.440
anytime soon.

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.190
Good thing we left Shei and Stone

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:40.390
at the cave entrance.

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:42.770
With snow this heavy,

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:43.960
we might not find

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:44.890
a passable path.

Wait.

These black stones

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:51.710
look weird to you too?

as what I saw just now.

You don't know the way

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.480
and are leading us around
in circles, right?

00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:58.800
Nonsense!

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.400
How could I not know the way?

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.880
these black stones are everywhere.

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:08.200
They're not stones?

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:12.150
More accurately,

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:14.920
they're bricks from an ancient city wall.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.740
What kind of wall brick

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:17.880
crumbles so easily?

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.670
It was scorched brittle by fire.

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:21.800
What kind of fire could be that intense

00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:23.960
to make solid bricks brittle?

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:25.550
Besides,

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.440
this is the middle of nowhere.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:28.630
It doesn't look like
there was a city here.

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:29.230
There was.

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:33.380
There used to be a small kingdom here

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:34.490
called Gumo State.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.210
Gumo State?

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:37.920
Never heard of it.

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:38.670
I have.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.670
Intelligence gathering
is the Shisan Tower's specialty.

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:42.760
Gumo State was only about

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:43.760
the size of a city.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.130
A plague swept through.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.510
To stop its spread,

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:49.630
the king gathered the bodies
and burned them.

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:50.710
But accidentally,

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.800
it set the whole city ablaze.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.920
By dawn, the entire city was gone.

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:57.030
Still the same question:

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:59.090
what kind of fire could be so powerful

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:00.760
as to burn down an entire city?

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:03.020
So there's another version of the story:

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.630
the king of Gumo State angered the gods,

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:07.330
who first sent a plague

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:08.710
and then divine fire.

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.360
Divine fire?

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:13.190
Wait.

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.440
Why is that physician living

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.290
in a place like this?

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.440
Let's keep moving forward.

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:21.000
Senior.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:50.400
Chunji.

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:52.510
Look,

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:54.000
these are all herbs

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.590
for strengthening the body
and boosting energy.

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:58.440
We're all family in the Sword Alliance.

00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.630
If you ever need more,

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:01.070
just tell me.

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:02.980
I'll get them for you right away.

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:04.590
If your room isn't clean enough,

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:06.550
call your fellow disciples to clean it up.

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:07.920
Don't you think

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:09.770
that Master sacrificed

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:12.030
many people from the Alliance to save me?

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:13.030
Of course not.

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:15.620
Though Master Shao

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:16.900
hesitated at first,

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:18.110
Mr. Tang

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:20.360
spoke passionately,

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:21.590
saying you are

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:23.250
a role model for all disciples

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:24.780
and must not be abandoned.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.400
Otherwise, it'd demoralize everyone.

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.000
And it's just as well—

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.230
we should let the Fengliu Shop see

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:30.090
how united the Sword Alliance is.

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:32.360
We stand with Mr. Tang.

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.960
We'll fight Fengliu Shop to the end.

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:37.760
Chunji,

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.480
those foolish words you just said—

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:41.630
who did you hear them from?
