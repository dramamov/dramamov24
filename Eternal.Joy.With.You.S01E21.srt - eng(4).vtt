=Episode 21=

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.400
My Lady,

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.920
Cui Yunfeng has been locked
in the wood shed.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.670
He confessed that it was the Princess
who rescued him

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.170
and instructed him to do all this.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.490
Just as expected.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.100
This was found on Cui Yunfeng.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.100
He said that Lady Cui gave it to him
before she died.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.840
Lady Cui sold Hongzhen Incense
in the past.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.370
It's not hard to guess that the person
behind her is the Prince.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.430
I just didn't expect

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.040
they actually have
such similar thumb rings.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.040
They look like a matching pair.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.520
Could it be

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.790
that Lady Cui and the Prince

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.120
have a story between them?

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.560
Wanning.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.680
Wanning.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.150
Wanning.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.930
Your Highness,

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.990
I heard from the servants
of the Governor's Mansion

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.000
the Commander is now out
of life-threatening danger.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.520
And he just needs to focus
on recovering from the injuries.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.710
Pei Heng,

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.020
do you truly love her that much?

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.940
(Commander's Mansion)

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.260
You're awake.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.580
How are you feeling?

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.740
Do you feel any discomfort?

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.020
You must be thirsty.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.300
I'll go pour you some water.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.660
Wanning,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.740
I want to tell you something.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.220
Yesterday I learned the truth
from six years ago.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.180
Chang'an...

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.100
He is my child.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:58.790
What did you say?

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.660
Six years ago.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.320
At the poetry gathering
from six years ago,

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.420
I made you lose your virginity.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.140
(Six years ago)

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.230
Heng, today's wine is quite good.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:18.520
Have another cup.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:21.770
Here.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.650
Your Highness, the Prince
wants to meet you.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.460
Heng, wait for me.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.570
I'll be right back.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.600
Alright.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.560
Commander,

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.130
you were poisoned in the borders.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.660
It is not advisable to drink alcohol.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.860
I want to find a room

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.060
to regulate my breathing.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.190
(Oh no).

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.290
(This...)

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.270
(This is aphrodisiac).

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.570
♪Streetlamps flicker with a dim yellow light♪

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.500

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.780
(The medicinal effects
suddenly took hold just now.)

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.140
(Plus, my body was already injured.)

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.470
(I could only go along
with the effects of the medicine,)

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.290
(so as not to have
my blood surge upwards)

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.170
(and my meridians rupture.)

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:10.570
(But because of me, this lady...)

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.130
Your Highness,

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.550
the Commander went to change clothes.
I will go find him now.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.400
(Today is the Princess's poetry gathering.)

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.090
(There are many people and prying eyes.)

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.020
(Even if I marry her,)

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.940
(it would still damage her reputation.)

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.660
(Better to wait
until the poetry gathering is over,)

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.540
(then I will visit to formally propose.)

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.860
Congratulations!

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.300
This merchant's daughter
has truly climbed to a high branch.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.280
The Cui Family is indeed
a prestigious household.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.860
She's just here to snag a rich husband.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.020
She had it planned all along.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.700
I heard they met
at the poetry gathering.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:58.900
Congratulations!

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.650
Well, she really is capable

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:01.880
of using any despicable tactic.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:16.730
(So that's how it is.)

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.700
(Now that you can marry him,)

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.500
(then he should be your ideal husband.)

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:35.540
Wanning,

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:37.140
it's my fault.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:39.070
It's my fault.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.620
I know you feel upset.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.650
As long as it can make you feel better,

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:45.990
you can treat me however you want.

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:48.640
As long as it can make you feel better,

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.580
you can hit me or scold me.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.100
You should rest first.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.860
I want to be alone for a while.

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:08.920
- Wanning...
- Don't follow me.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.280
Here, eat a bit more.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.540
Let's eat.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.870
Mother, why are your eyes red?

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.280
Perhaps the wind was too strong today.

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:07.580
It blew into my eyes. It's nothing.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.640
Aunt Ning, are you angry with Master?

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:11.820
What's wrong?

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:13.860
Today we went to see Master.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.390
His expression was just like yours.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.250
We're fine.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.580
Don't overthink it. Just eat.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:28.980
Mother, don't be sad.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.230
Master definitely didn't make you angry
on purpose.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.360
Talk to him properly.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.710
It'll be fine once the misunderstanding
is cleared up.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.050
That's how it was with Ruyi and me.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.360
Alright, it's good
once the misunderstanding is cleared up.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.340
There really wasn't anything.
Come on, eat.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:52.020
(Yes).

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.660
(If the misunderstanding is resolved,
we can reconcile.)

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.500
(But what if it's not a misunderstanding?)

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.660
Have Chang'an and Ruyi
both gone to sleep?

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.290
It's done.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.180
Is there nothing you want to say to me?

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:32.950
What do you want to hear me say?

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.840
I just don't want to see you
like this now.

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:47.990
Actually, I've been thinking
these past two days.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.160
I don't want to believe
that person is you.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.360
After all, in these past six years,

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.420
all the pain, torment, and hardship
I experienced

00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.420
all started from that moment.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.540
- I understand.
- You don't understand.

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.700
Do you know what it means

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.090
for a woman to lose her virginity?

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.020
At that time, the only thing
I thought about all day

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.820
was how I should die.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.540
At that time, my father guarded me
day and night.

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:27.500
I kept thinking about him in my heart.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.260
Otherwise, I might have died long ago.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.440
Later, everything I experienced
in the Marquis's Mansion

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.620
was no different from death.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.220
Thinking about it now,

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.780
you always helped me at that time

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:55.280
and now you marry me.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.020
Is it because you feel guilty?

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:00.620
Helping you

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.860
was because I couldn't bear
to see you in trouble.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.140
Marrying you

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.460
was truly because I am deeply
fond of you.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:18.780
Wanning,

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.660
I am well aware of my deep sins.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.880
So whether you forgive me or not

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.690
I will still take responsibility
for the mistakes I made back then.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.260
Forget it.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.900
The one who was wrong was the person
who lit the incense.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:44.300
It's just...

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:46.900
It's just that I keep wondering

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.300
why that person was you.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.300
Heaven really loves to toy with people.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.260
I don't blame you.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.660
It's just that I can't accept all of this

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:04.820
right away.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.580
I will do my best to make it up to you.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.980
No matter what decision
you make in the end,

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:24.740
I will respect you.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:28.450
Focus on recovering first.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.600
My Lady, are you alright?

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.750
I'm fine. What's wrong?

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:54.670
My Lady,

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:56.240
you asked me to investigate those people

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.550
who took advantage
of the master's addiction to the Incense

00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:59.360
to swindle his money.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.770
I discovered they are all connected
to Prince Feng Zhengxin.

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:05.090
As expected.

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:09.180
Now your family's shops
are all in the hands of the Prince.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.660
It seems that since the Prince failed
to marry me before,

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.340
he has started targeting my father.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.500
What should we do then?

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.100
There are still many people

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.940
