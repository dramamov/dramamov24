00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.079
What's the rush? So annoying.

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:38.719
Your driving style resembles mine.

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:40.200
The way you curse.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.599
So you also keep

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.680
a sharp lookout

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.200
while cursing everything?

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:48.439
Cursing those cutting in

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.079
and wouldn't let us cut in.

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:51.599
Cursing the drivers when biking

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.159
and cursing the bikers when driving.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.280
Yeah.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.000
Now that I can't drive anymore,

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.239
I realize how rude

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.920
I used to be.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.400
Why do I feel

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.120
that you're trash-talking me?

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.120
Did you curse this much

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:06.400
on the rides with your ex?

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:07.359
No.

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:09.319
Got this right after

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.479
my ex and I split.

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:11.639
A who-knows-what-hand car.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.120
Put up with it, rich lady.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.840
I like your

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:15.879
high chassis car.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.000
Nice visibility.

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:18.080
And I haven't

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.759
sat in the passenger seat for ages.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.080
So your husband

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:22.879
drives a luxury car with spacious

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.879
back seats,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.080
unlike my car

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:26.120
with its cramped back.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.719
Where do you live?

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:28.800
Which direction?

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.360
Take me back to the cafe.

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:31.960
Still worried

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.280
when I'm dressed like this?

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.800
When he finishes work early,

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.759
he picks me up.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.560
What does he do?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.719
He's an artist.

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.080
Impressive.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.439
What kind of art?

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.759
Can you drive or not?

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.879
That car cut in.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.080
What's the hurry? Off to reincarnate?

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.240
You're actually

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.360
adding me on WeChat?

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.199
Scan the code.

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:00.439
I'll see if I accept

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:01.439
your friend request.

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:03.599
You seem in a good mood today.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.080
See you around.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.120
Zeng Jie.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.680
I suddenly remembered someone.

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:23.280
Who?

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.400
Liu Wei.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.840
What do you want?

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:32.800
It just crossed my mind.

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:33.879
You want to dig up

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:35.159
the messes again?

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.000
I didn't mean to bring it up

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.919
or pick a fight.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.960
I just...

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:42.000
What do you want,

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.639
Bai Xiaoling?

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.639
It amuses you

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.439
to bring it up?

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:45.400
No.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.879
Sometimes, I even wonder

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.280
if it was karma

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.879
that made me unable to walk.

00:04:00.896 --> 00:04:02.272
I shouldn't have mentioned her.

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:04.479
I know we agreed

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.319
to let the past stay buried

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.520
and no one

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:09.879
shall mention it again.

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.759
Let's go home.

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:12.319
You'll have to

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.719
go back to work again.

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:15.520
Forget it.

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:16.639
We're almost home.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.000
I'll go alone.

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:19.959
I could use some fresh air.

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:26.360
Please grab my wheelchair.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.120
Bai Xiaoling.

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:01.360
I don't know

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:02.160
what got into you.

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:03.720
But last year, we agreed

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:05.480
not to mention this ever again.

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:07.279
Let me remind you.

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:08.959
We agreed that

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.160
whoever wanted

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.040
a divorce

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:12.680
could bring it up.

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:14.399
Tell me.

00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:16.639
You want a divorce again?

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:19.519
No.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.439
You haven't even returned

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:22.279
my parents' money.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.040
How can I divorce you?

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:02.600
I shouldn't have

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:03.639
brought it up.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.920
From now on,

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:06.480
I won't mention it again.

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:15.079
(Yeah.)

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:16.439
(She's pretty,)

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.000
(classy,)

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.439
(and loaded.)

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:21.920
(Many people think)

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.959
(I married the perfect woman.)

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.000
(But they don't know)

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.920
that she often

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:29.879
says hurtful things

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:32.000
in the coldest tone.

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:36.439
And she always had that look of contempt

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.199
for it.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.519
I'm an artist, a professor.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.839
She's just a new rich's daughter.

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:46.439
Yet she carries

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.439
this sense of

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:48.920
superiority and coldness.

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:52.120
Maybe it's because

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.480
she grew up in privilege

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.600
with too many suitors.

00:06:56.079 --> 00:06:57.079
She thinks all men

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.560
should revolve around her?

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:03.000
She wants

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:04.319
evidence of your infidelity

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.040
to claim your assets.

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:08.040
Didn't you say

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.319
her family's rich?

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:11.319
Who doesn't want more money?

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:13.959
We have substantial joint assets.

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:15.600
She probably wants me

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.279
to leave empty-handed.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.639
Fortunately,

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:22.439
I'm the one she hired

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:23.759
to help her.

00:07:28.519 --> 00:07:29.560
Why did you tell me

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:32.000
that you're sent by Bai Xiaoling

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.240
to trap me in adultery?

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.120
She told me to smash

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.240
your artwork.

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:37.600
She said

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:39.000
you would only be glad

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:40.319
and not mad.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.959
She really knows you well.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.240
You did it.

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:45.959
But when I saw you,

00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:47.279
I fell for you.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.879
I wasn't interested in ceramics

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:50.560
or blemish flaws.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.120
But you showed me

00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:54.319
that even mud can be extraordinary.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.199
That with heartfelt.

00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:03.240
I didn't even like

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.560
my first love this much.

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:06.279
The men I met before

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:07.399
were all worthless.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.839
Overambitious college boys,

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.639
aimless and broke drifters,

00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:14.759
tasteless rich kids who only show off.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.000
And someone who resents

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.439
being ordinary

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.879
yet remains average like my ex.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.199
No one is your match.

00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:26.480
Though I know

00:08:27.319 --> 00:08:28.079
we don't have

00:08:28.079 --> 00:08:29.040
a future together,

00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:30.560
I still can't help

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.399
liking you.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.879
How do you know

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.759
we don't have a future?

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.600
Master Zeng,

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:41.559
could you tolerate someone

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:43.240
full of blemish flaws like me?

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.799
I'd even seduce

00:08:45.879 --> 00:08:47.960
a married man for money.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.039
But you're genuine.

00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:53.440
I can't lie to myself.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.440
I've fallen for you.

00:08:57.039 --> 00:08:58.000
So,

00:09:02.799 --> 00:09:04.360
I have more crucial evidence.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.960
Half a million for this.

00:09:14.799 --> 00:09:16.080
How much did my wife pay you?

00:09:16.519 --> 00:09:17.200
300,000.

00:09:17.919 --> 00:09:19.039
200,000 balance.

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:21.080
It never occurred to you

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:23.000
to make a copy for her too?

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.399
I like you,

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.799
not her.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.240
200,000 yuan.

00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:30.320
What if you change your mind?

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.200
I'm this crazy about you,

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.759
but you still don't trust me?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.600
Fine then.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.399
I secretly recorded a video

00:09:38.919 --> 00:09:39.879
when your wife

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:40.799
came to me.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.039
She was captured

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.799
telling me to seduce you

00:09:44.879 --> 00:09:45.879
and secure evidence.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.240
You recorded that?

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.679
Yeah.

00:09:49.759 --> 00:09:50.519
I was afraid

00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:51.639
she wouldn't pay up.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.120
That video will be useful to you.

00:09:54.759 --> 00:09:55.679
With that,

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.679
would you still fear her?

00:09:59.759 --> 00:10:01.559
Do you think I'd fear her?

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.679
I've wanted to end this marriage

00:10:03.679 --> 00:10:04.480
for a while.

00:10:05.399 --> 00:10:06.519
And

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.480
I like you too.

00:10:13.639 --> 00:10:14.440
Too bad.

00:10:15.279 --> 00:10:16.919
I can't accept blemish flaws either.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.639
Cheating is a red line.

00:10:21.759 --> 00:10:22.799
Remember?

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.919
When we first started dating,

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.840
I broke up with my ex first.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.279
I only accept cash.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.960
Your wife also paid me in cash.

00:10:37.799 --> 00:10:39.039
800,000 in cash.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.840
You should have it ready soon, right?

00:11:07.399 --> 00:11:08.399
My brother-in-law.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.320
You're back.

00:11:11.039 --> 00:11:12.039
What a coincidence.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.480
I was just leaving.

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:20.120
You're here again.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.879
I had business in the city

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.039
and came to check on my brother-in-law.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.360
I've told you not to

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.159
call me that.

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:28.000
I never married your sister.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.159
So what if you didn't marry her?

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:32.440
You'll always

00:11:32.639 --> 00:11:33.960
be my brother-in-law.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.039
Besides,

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.039
there's no one else in the car.

00:11:37.159 --> 00:11:38.279
Your wife isn't here.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.360
What's her name again?

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.320
Bai Xiaoling, right?

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.519
If you came back with a woman,

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.639
even if she wasn't your wife,

00:11:47.879 --> 00:11:49.320
I'd pretend not to know you.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.879
When have I ever caused you trouble?

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.480
But my sister

00:11:57.879 --> 00:11:59.000
isn't so lucky.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.080
The fortune teller said she's

00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:02.120
destined to be poor.

00:12:03.039 --> 00:12:04.159
She wasn't lucky enough

00:12:04.519 --> 00:12:05.960
to marry you.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.159
What can we do?

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.639
But I'm lucky enough

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.919
to have you as my brother-in-law.

00:12:12.159 --> 00:12:12.840
Wait here.

00:12:48.399 --> 00:12:49.360
That's all?

00:12:49.799 --> 00:12:50.679
I don't have cash.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.480
I'll give you my bank account.

00:12:53.399 --> 00:12:54.320
I told you.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.440
No bank transfers.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.080
Are you scared?

00:12:58.639 --> 00:13:01.519
Are you scared that people will

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.720
find out about me

00:13:02.919 --> 00:13:04.399
or the fact that

00:13:05.399 --> 00:13:06.960
I have a sister?

00:13:11.399 --> 00:13:12.120
How much more?

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.639
Don't make it sound like
I'm extorting you.

00:13:15.759 --> 00:13:17.720
I need to renovate the hometown house

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.919
and my sister's place needs repair.

00:13:20.679 --> 00:13:21.279
Not much.

00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:22.200
100,000.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.279
Come next week.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.519
But inform me

00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:26.440
before you come.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:27.799
Alright.

00:13:28.799 --> 00:13:30.200
Then I'll make another trip.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:33.879
Lin Shan.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.559
I've been giving you

00:13:36.759 --> 00:13:37.519
what you ask for.

00:13:38.039 --> 00:13:39.080
But remember.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.159
Keep your mouth shut.

00:13:41.559 --> 00:13:43.200
My lips are sealed.

00:13:43.399 --> 00:13:45.039
If I spill the beans,

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.399
and make your rich wife

00:13:47.559 --> 00:13:48.879
divorce you...

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:49.759
Wait,

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.759
your wife

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.879
broke her legs.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.519
She can't leave you anyway.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.200
Brother-in-law,

00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:02.440
you've got it made now.

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:03.840
Listen, Lin Shan.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.559
If you want money,

00:14:05.919 --> 00:14:07.320
keep your mouth shut.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:14.960
Zeng Jie.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.080
You're my brother-in-law,

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.639
not my older brother.

00:14:20.799 --> 00:14:22.159
Don't yell at me.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.000
Aren't you some kind of artist?

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.080
Be civilized and polite.

00:14:30.639 --> 00:14:31.679
You hear me?

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:34.679
I'm off.

00:14:38.279 --> 00:14:38.960
By the way.

00:14:39.639 --> 00:14:41.759
When are you changing your car?

00:14:42.279 --> 00:14:44.320
Let me know when you do.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.039
Let me drive it.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.879
Dispose of all these.

00:15:05.399 --> 00:15:06.879
And those trashy works

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.480
with blemish flaws.

00:15:08.559 --> 00:15:09.559
Don't keep a single one!

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.039
Bring me those.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:21.840
What a pity.

00:15:22.799 --> 00:15:24.320
You still lack attention to detail.

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:26.320
If you controlled

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.480
the temperature better,

00:15:29.559 --> 00:15:30.799
would these issues occur?

00:15:32.159 --> 00:15:32.759
Professor Zeng.

00:15:33.639 --> 00:15:35.200
Are we smashing all these?

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.000
How many times have I told you?

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.639
Without perfectionist standards,

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.159
how can you create masterpieces?

00:15:43.039 --> 00:15:44.320
Professor, he...

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.159
It's you again?

00:16:08.544 --> 00:16:09.312
Want an interview?

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.320
Isn't it a waste

00:16:10.399 --> 00:16:11.039
to smash

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:11.840
all these pieces?

00:16:12.159 --> 00:16:13.120
I get rid of artworks

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:14.159
with blemish flaws.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:15.679
You know

00:16:15.679 --> 00:16:16.399
blemish flaws.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:16.960
Yeah.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.440
Wei explained it to me.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.120
Who is this Wei to you?

00:16:21.639 --> 00:16:22.320
My ex.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.200
When did you break up?

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.039
Last year.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.320
You've been looking for her?

00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:26.840
No, just these past few days.

00:16:27.559 --> 00:16:28.080
When was

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:28.960
the last time

00:16:29.039 --> 00:16:29.919
you saw Liu Wei?

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.039
I don't know her.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.200
We've never met.

00:16:38.159 --> 00:16:38.919
Why don't you check

00:16:39.039 --> 00:16:39.720
your contacts?

00:16:39.799 --> 00:16:40.480
My friend.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.919
I don't get what you're doing.

00:16:42.519 --> 00:16:44.679
But I won't intervene.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:45.639
Likewise,

00:16:46.039 --> 00:16:47.240
I don't want you

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.399
to keep harassing me

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.799
for no reason.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.919
I don't care what grudges

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:52.799
you have with her

00:16:52.799 --> 00:16:54.159
that you're looking for her

00:16:54.399 --> 00:16:55.279
after a year.

00:16:55.559 --> 00:16:57.000
This is your private matter.

00:16:57.279 --> 00:16:58.120
I won't interfere.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.120
Just don't come

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.639
ever again.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.200
Professor Zeng,

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.079
did you study acting?

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.279
You act like

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:07.519
you really don't know her.

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:10.400
I don't know her.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:11.880
Nor do I know you.

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:13.720
Leave my studio now.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.400
Framing me?

00:17:21.312 --> 00:17:22.112
Call the police.

00:17:22.304 --> 00:17:22.960
Call the police?

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:24.000
Call the police?

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:25.839
He damaged your work.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.640
These were flawed pieces

00:17:27.799 --> 00:17:29.119
to be discarded.

00:17:29.759 --> 00:17:31.039
This is my student's

00:17:31.519 --> 00:17:32.160
completed work

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.319
despite the blemish flaws.

00:17:33.599 --> 00:17:34.480
We can discard it.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.599
But you have no right

00:17:35.599 --> 00:17:36.279
to do so.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.880
You barged into my studio

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.160
and destroyed our works.

00:17:39.319 --> 00:17:40.440
So I'm calling the police.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.960
You turn out to be so shameless.

00:17:43.039 --> 00:17:44.079
Save your words

00:17:44.359 --> 00:17:45.359
for the police.

00:17:51.359 --> 00:17:52.359
How much is this worth?

00:17:52.599 --> 00:17:53.480
Don't scam me.

00:17:55.519 --> 00:17:56.480
Why did you smash

00:17:56.559 --> 00:17:57.519
his porcelain?

00:17:57.599 --> 00:17:58.079
I just

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.039
pulled him a bit.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.279
And he threw the porcelain

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.359
onto the ground.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.440
And when I arrived,

00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:04.039
they were smashing those.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.680
Those were flawed pieces

00:18:05.759 --> 00:18:06.839
to be disposed of.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.599
He set you up?

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:14.720
He has something to do

00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:15.839
with Wei's disappearance.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:16.720
He's been hostile

00:18:16.799 --> 00:18:18.279
toward me the whole time.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.640
If he wasn't guilty,

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.680
why would he do this?

00:18:21.599 --> 00:18:22.200
Speculations

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:22.920
don't work.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.359
Speculations put us

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.160
on the right track.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.119
In that case,

00:18:26.119 --> 00:18:27.599
I'll uncover the truth.

00:18:29.359 --> 00:18:30.519
Have you eaten yet?

00:18:32.359 --> 00:18:33.640
I came straight

00:18:33.799 --> 00:18:35.200
from work. What do you think?

00:18:40.359 --> 00:18:41.599
Have you analyzed

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.039
the online information

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.599
about Zeng Jie?

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:46.680
What information?

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.599
Zeng Jie fought his way up

00:18:48.599 --> 00:18:49.359
on his own.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.400
His family was poor.

00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:51.759
He took part-time jobs

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:52.960
and scholarships

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:53.799
in college.

00:18:54.359 --> 00:18:55.079
But he suddenly

00:18:55.559 --> 00:18:56.759
got rich during

00:18:56.839 --> 00:18:57.759
his graduate years.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.640
He even drove to school.

00:19:00.039 --> 00:19:01.240
Upon graduation,

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.720
he stayed as a lecturer.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.920
He kept winning awards

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000
in the following years.

00:19:05.319 --> 00:19:06.599
Then he got married

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.440
to a business family heiress,

00:19:08.599 --> 00:19:09.240
who is wealthy.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.240
So he met his wife

00:19:11.319 --> 00:19:12.480
during graduate years.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.160
He latched onto a rich lady.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.119
This makes perfect sense now.

00:19:16.359 --> 00:19:18.000
Zeng Jie used his wife's money

00:19:18.119 --> 00:19:18.960
to change his life.

00:19:19.279 --> 00:19:20.200
That's why he couldn't

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:21.880
let anyone discover his affair.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.240
That's right.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.880
I bet his wife has no idea

00:19:25.079 --> 00:19:26.000
about his infidelity.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.640
Why are you so sure?

00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:28.880
I'm almost certain.

00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:30.000
Just need to dig deeper.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.240
Want to

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.359
talk to his wife?

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.279
That's clearly

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.279
a viable path.

00:19:34.359 --> 00:19:35.039
Don't worry.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.559
I won't act recklessly.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.799
Everything will stay
within legal boundaries.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.960
Finally getting on track.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:44.720
You also suspect

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.599
Zeng Jie, right?

00:19:45.599 --> 00:19:46.160
What else

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:46.880
did you find?

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.119
The rest seems

00:19:48.119 --> 00:19:49.000
pretty useless.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.559
Same info online.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.359
No, no.

00:19:52.119 --> 00:19:53.240
Basic info is crucial.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.680
The details you shared

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.680
with me today

00:19:55.759 --> 00:19:56.640
are vital.

00:19:56.839 --> 00:19:57.880
I always assumed

00:19:58.279 --> 00:19:59.559
Zeng Jie's success

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:00.920
came easily.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.160
But he turned out to be

00:20:03.279 --> 00:20:05.079
a common guy who'd endured hardships.

00:20:05.319 --> 00:20:06.279
That's important.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.519
How?

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.599
How is it important?

00:20:13.119 --> 00:20:13.920
Imagine a market

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.920
with security guards.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.359
The captain retires,

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.200
and promotes

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.319
a subordinate.

00:20:18.599 --> 00:20:19.079
To prove

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.400
himself worthy as a leader,

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.240
he'll be stricter

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.680
with former colleagues

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:23.839
more than necessary.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.200
He won't hesitate to scold

00:20:25.359 --> 00:20:26.079
and punish them.

00:20:26.359 --> 00:20:27.279
Even a minor mistake

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.319
calls for punishment.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.400
And he won't hesitate to fire anyone.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.559
People's mindsets change
with their status.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.519
To climb the social ladder,

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.319
one must pay their dues.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.319
Yeah.

00:20:41.599 --> 00:20:43.680
If Zeng Jie came from a poor family

00:20:43.759 --> 00:20:45.440
and worked his way up,

00:20:45.799 --> 00:20:47.480
he would do anything it takes

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.400
to maintain his status

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.279
and lifestyle.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.200
I really hope you're wrong.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.279
So little faith in me?

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.880
It's not about faith.

00:20:58.519 --> 00:20:59.880
If you're wrong,

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.359
Wei will be safe.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:02.799
It is the best.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.520
I wouldn't want anything
to happen to her.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:21.480
Ma'am.

00:21:21.559 --> 00:21:22.559
Two packs of these.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.359
And a lollipop.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.410
Alright.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.119
Ma'am.

00:21:27.559 --> 00:21:28.680
Where can I find

00:21:28.759 --> 00:21:30.200
a painter in this village?

00:21:30.559 --> 00:21:31.319
Painter of what?

00:21:31.839 --> 00:21:33.519
Just regular paintings.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:34.960
Everywhere.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.920
E-Everywhere?

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.720
Only we run this store.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.319
All the other are painters.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.279
All the others?

00:21:42.119 --> 00:21:43.720
Do they actually make money?

00:21:44.079 --> 00:21:44.960
Young man.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.920
We have to make ends meet somehow.

00:21:59.240 --> 00:21:59.599
Sir.

00:21:59.839 --> 00:22:01.279
Can I ask about someone?

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:02.640
Who?

00:22:03.119 --> 00:22:04.000
Have you ever

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.119
hired a man

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:05.920
called Zeng Jie?

00:22:06.519 --> 00:22:07.200
Zeng Jie?

00:22:07.559 --> 00:22:09.200
Do we have a Zeng Jie here?

00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:10.680
No.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.119
Nobody by that name.

00:22:12.415 --> 00:22:13.475
What painting do you want?

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.480
He paints...

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.839
We paint Van Gogh replicas here.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.240
What style are you aiming for?

00:22:19.599 --> 00:22:21.240
This is how it works?

00:22:21.559 --> 00:22:23.119
We have to paint different stuff.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:23.880
Each village

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.000
has a specialty.

00:22:25.519 --> 00:22:26.440
See across the road?

00:22:26.759 --> 00:22:27.640
Gauguin replicas.

00:22:28.079 --> 00:22:29.720
Monet replicas further east.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.480
Pissarro replicas behind that.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.079
All impressionist stuff.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.960
We used to do Picasso cubism

00:22:36.599 --> 00:22:37.960
and Dadaism.

00:22:38.279 --> 00:22:39.839
But business dried up.

00:22:40.079 --> 00:22:40.799
Now we're

00:22:40.839 --> 00:22:42.039
sticking to impressionism.

00:22:42.359 --> 00:22:43.839
We haven't heard of Zeng Jie.

00:22:44.599 --> 00:22:45.200
Thanks.

00:22:45.319 --> 00:22:46.599
I'll ask around.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:47.759
Take care.

00:22:51.924 --> 00:22:55.040
(Bulk purchase discounts available)

00:23:06.359 --> 00:23:06.799
Sir.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:07.880
Sir.

00:23:08.256 --> 00:23:08.896
Want a painting?

00:23:08.896 --> 00:23:09.559
No.

00:23:09.759 --> 00:23:11.000
I'm looking for someone.

00:23:11.319 --> 00:23:11.920
Have you ever

00:23:12.079 --> 00:23:13.039
hired a guy

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.119
called Zeng Jie?

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.359
Zeng, you said?

00:23:16.799 --> 00:23:17.680
I think

00:23:17.839 --> 00:23:19.680
someone was by that surname.

00:23:20.039 --> 00:23:20.880
Handsome Zeng.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.720
Handsome Zeng?

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.039
I forgot his real name.

00:23:25.319 --> 00:23:26.680
Last name Zeng, handsome guy.

00:23:26.839 --> 00:23:28.319
Everyone called him Handsome Zeng.

00:23:29.119 --> 00:23:30.000
Now I remember.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.640
That was seven or eight years back.

00:23:33.039 --> 00:23:34.559
No way.

00:23:34.799 --> 00:23:36.039
It was a decade ago.

00:23:36.279 --> 00:23:37.200
Back then, your kid

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.400
wasn't even born.

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.640
That guy was something.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.720
He could paint two canvases at once.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.880
Simultaneously?

00:23:45.359 --> 00:23:47.880
He had fast hands.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.480
But he was fierce

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.240
and earned way more than others.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.000
His family was poor.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.440
So he had to work hard.

00:24:03.119 --> 00:24:03.880
So hardworking?

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.640
I need money.

00:24:06.599 --> 00:24:07.759
My dad's in the hospital.

00:24:07.839 --> 00:24:09.720
We can't borrow
a single penny from anyone.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:10.880
Where am I supposed

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.440
to get 400,000 yuan?

00:24:12.759 --> 00:24:14.119
And I got accepted

00:24:14.359 --> 00:24:15.559
into graduate school.

00:24:16.799 --> 00:24:18.240
Even if I get scholarships,

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.599
there are daily expenses.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.359
How much do you sell this for?

00:24:23.519 --> 00:24:25.240
Water Lilies sells for 500 yuan.

00:24:25.319 --> 00:24:26.359
Wholesale's 350 yuan.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.680
Sunrise is trending.

00:24:27.799 --> 00:24:29.119
Each sells for 50 yuan more.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.079
The gallery bought these.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.519
Each sells for 2000 to 3000.

00:24:32.759 --> 00:24:33.559
I get 150

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.480
per painting.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:35.759
These artworks

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.240
aren't that expensive.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.039
You call this artwork?

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:44.960
This is just replication.

00:24:45.359 --> 00:24:46.200
Zero creativity.

00:24:47.279 --> 00:24:48.680
At best, it's a craft.

00:24:50.799 --> 00:24:51.359
No.

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.039
Not even a craft.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.279
It's garbage.

00:24:55.119 --> 00:24:55.839
Trash.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.519
So he made money

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.599
and left?

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.319
What money?

00:25:06.559 --> 00:25:08.519
He's no Monet.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.279
He paints one per day.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.759
That's just over 100 yuan.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.279
To save up 400,000 yuan,

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:14.799
he'd need 3000 paintings

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.039
without eating or drinking.

00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:19.119
He went to school.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.079
He could've kept painting,

00:25:21.279 --> 00:25:22.759
but he never showed up.

00:25:25.079 --> 00:25:26.039
Perfect timing.

00:25:26.359 --> 00:25:27.240
I just sorted out

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.440
old photos on my phone.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:30.160
He's here.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.039
You have his photo?

00:25:31.559 --> 00:25:32.960
Look, this is our group photo.

00:25:33.039 --> 00:25:33.680
This one.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:34.680
That's him.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.920
Yeah, that's him.

00:25:40.519 --> 00:25:42.319
Who's the woman next to him?

00:25:43.319 --> 00:25:44.359
I think it's Lin Fang.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.039
She was Gauguin's sales rep.

00:25:46.359 --> 00:25:47.160
Lin Fang?

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.200
Was she somehow involved

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.519
with this guy?

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.440
What do you mean by involved?

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.640
But I do know a woman

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.839
who often came to see him.

00:25:57.519 --> 00:25:58.880
A rich woman, right?

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.079
A rich woman?

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:00.759
Yeah.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:01.559
You've seen her?

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.200
That sports car?

00:26:03.279 --> 00:26:04.000
Yeah.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.400
Handsome guys have it good.

00:26:05.799 --> 00:26:07.720
I wish some rich lady would

00:26:07.839 --> 00:26:08.519
come find me.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.000
Look at your face.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.359
Unless those rich ladies

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.200
are blind.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:13.400
Sir.

00:26:14.839 --> 00:26:16.079
Can you send me

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:16.799
that photo

00:26:16.839 --> 00:26:17.480
on your phone?

00:26:17.839 --> 00:26:19.039
Okay.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:20.559
Also,

00:26:20.799 --> 00:26:21.920
do you have

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.039
Lin Fang's contact info?

00:26:26.119 --> 00:26:26.680
What?

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.119
I'm obviously working right now.

00:26:30.279 --> 00:26:30.920
Really?

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.160
You actually tracked down

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.359
where he worked?

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:35.880
Lin Fang?

00:26:37.876 --> 00:26:40.864
(Big Hui)

00:26:41.839 --> 00:26:43.160
What was that photo

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:43.880
you sent me?

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.680
Lin Fang was close to Zeng Jie.

00:26:45.839 --> 00:26:47.279
It took a lot of digging.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.079
But for some reason,

00:26:50.119 --> 00:26:51.319
I can't reach her.

00:26:51.319 --> 00:26:53.759
She might be the key.

00:26:53.759 --> 00:26:55.960
I bet there was something between them.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
What do you mean?

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.559
It's just a group photo.

00:27:02.759 --> 00:27:03.200
Dude.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.200
Be more observant.

00:27:04.319 --> 00:27:06.160
Look closely. Zoom in.

00:27:06.599 --> 00:27:07.680
Wasn't Lin Fang

00:27:07.799 --> 00:27:08.839
looking at Zeng Jie?

00:27:09.079 --> 00:27:09.599
Yeah.

00:27:09.759 --> 00:27:11.160
The photo is a bit blurry,

00:27:11.359 --> 00:27:12.599
but look closely and tell me,

00:27:12.839 --> 00:27:14.119
doesn't it look like

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.119
she was in love?

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.839
And she had paint

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.279
all over her wrists.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.200
She's a salesperson,

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.079
not a painter.

00:27:20.319 --> 00:27:21.639
How'd she get paint on her?

00:27:21.639 --> 00:27:22.839
Even if she grabbed something,

00:27:22.839 --> 00:27:24.400
the paint wouldn't be there.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:25.839
Now look at Zeng Jie.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:26.920
Hands covered in paint.

00:27:27.119 --> 00:27:28.079
Clearly, he had been

00:27:28.119 --> 00:27:29.400
grabbing Lin Fang's hands.

00:27:32.279 --> 00:27:33.119
Indeed.

00:27:35.359 --> 00:27:36.559
Who is this Lin Fang?

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.839
Based on my deductions,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.640
and you know my reasoning skills

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.720
are solid,

00:27:41.799 --> 00:27:43.000
Lin Fang was

00:27:43.119 --> 00:27:44.519
Zeng Jie's secret girlfriend

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.079
from his early years.

00:27:46.519 --> 00:27:47.119
Zeng Jie

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.759
did come from a poor family

00:27:48.759 --> 00:27:49.599
and had no money.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.839
But people at the Artist Village told me

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:52.839
that a rich woman

00:27:52.839 --> 00:27:54.480
had been visiting Zeng Jie.

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.440
Whether that was his wife,

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.119
I'll have to

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.920
find out somehow.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.640
You'll see his wife again?

00:28:01.119 --> 00:28:02.200
Watch your mouth.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.519
It's for investigation.

00:28:03.799 --> 00:28:04.559
You find it

00:28:04.599 --> 00:28:05.799
honorable to lie to her?

00:28:06.079 --> 00:28:07.279
How is this lying?

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:08.599
If Zeng Jie is a wolf

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.480
in sheep's clothing

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.319
as we suspect,

00:28:10.319 --> 00:28:11.440
then we're saving his wife

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.359
from disaster.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.200
She doesn't look

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:16.960
like a bad person.

00:28:18.319 --> 00:28:19.799
Alright, let me sort things out.

00:28:20.851 --> 00:28:24.736
(Meeting Zeng Jie, September 30, 2019)

00:28:27.891 --> 00:28:29.056
(Friend request accepted)

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.759
Took you a whole day to cheer up?

00:28:33.075 --> 00:28:34.304
(Fire outbreak)

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.440
I'm just okay. What are you doing?

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.079
Thinking through some things.

00:28:41.319 --> 00:28:42.240
(Fire outbreak)
I didn't have time

00:28:42.279 --> 00:28:44.400
(November 24, 2018)
to meet you at the cafe.

00:28:50.279 --> 00:28:51.599
You should be busy.

00:28:52.039 --> 00:28:53.720
I added you as an update reminder.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.319
Update reminder?

00:28:59.799 --> 00:29:00.319
Yeah.

00:29:00.839 --> 00:29:02.160
I've watched all your videos.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:02.960
Nothing left.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.200
(Married: 2016)
Upload more.

00:29:06.559 --> 00:29:07.400
Thanks.

00:29:07.519 --> 00:29:08.480
Did you like, save,

00:29:08.519 --> 00:29:09.440
or follow me?

00:29:12.359 --> 00:29:13.079
No.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.005
(Dating)
When will you upload a new one?

00:29:16.039 --> 00:29:17.079
I've been busy.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.480
Plus, no inspiration.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.000
You know how it is.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.079
Without inspiration,

00:29:21.079 --> 00:29:22.240
it's impossible.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:24.880
(Zeng Jie's wife)
What if you lose followers?

00:29:25.359 --> 00:29:26.160
It terrifies me.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.079
But I lose more followers

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.920
if I make videos without inspiration.

00:29:31.636 --> 00:29:34.279
(Wealthy)

00:29:34.279 --> 00:29:34.720
Alright.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:35.559
Fine.

00:29:35.599 --> 00:29:36.359
I'll delete you.

00:29:37.559 --> 00:29:39.039
Come on. You just added me.

00:29:39.039 --> 00:29:40.240
Why delete me?

00:29:43.039 --> 00:29:43.759
Big Hui.

00:29:44.279 --> 00:29:46.119
I'm a disabled married woman.

00:29:46.319 --> 00:29:48.000
Are you that desperate?

00:29:48.279 --> 00:29:49.119
Am I not

00:29:49.319 --> 00:29:51.039
a caregiver to you?

00:29:55.079 --> 00:29:56.440
Here's a tip for you.

00:29:56.799 --> 00:29:58.119
After the accident,

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.839
my husband manages all our finances.

00:30:00.319 --> 00:30:01.640
If you want a sugar mama,

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.839
I can't help you.

00:30:05.119 --> 00:30:05.960
Don't make me

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:06.720
sound so nasty.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.039
There should be

00:30:08.039 --> 00:30:09.559
basic trust.

00:30:13.319 --> 00:30:14.799
I won't delete you today.

00:30:15.119 --> 00:30:16.559
Maybe when I'm in a better mood.

00:30:17.039 --> 00:30:18.000
I'm going to bed.

00:30:18.079 --> 00:30:18.799
Goodbye.

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.160
Zeng Jie.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.319
Bai Xiaoling.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.400
Why did you fall for Zeng Jie?

00:30:42.839 --> 00:30:43.880
You probably don't know

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.119
about Wei.

00:30:46.359 --> 00:30:47.200
So,

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:49.640
do you know

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:50.839
Zeng Jie's secret?

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.160
So?

00:31:22.079 --> 00:31:24.039
Bai Xiaoling is a businesswoman

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.680
and a second-generation rich kid.

00:31:27.599 --> 00:31:28.359
Her company

00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:29.960
was funded by her parents.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.559
Her parents are retired.

00:31:31.799 --> 00:31:33.160
Her dad's been in the hospital

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.039
because of a stroke

00:31:35.119 --> 00:31:36.079
or something.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.000
It's been

00:31:37.079 --> 00:31:37.799
over a year.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.240
Her husband's a professor

00:31:40.759 --> 00:31:41.680
and a famous

00:31:41.839 --> 00:31:42.599
ceramics master.

00:31:43.039 --> 00:31:44.039
What about her?

00:31:44.119 --> 00:31:45.799
She graduated from a mediocre college,

00:31:46.519 --> 00:31:47.440
studying management.

00:31:48.039 --> 00:31:48.839
She didn't seem

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:49.759
so hardworking.

00:31:50.079 --> 00:31:51.000
She was traveling

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.160
and organizing

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.240
club activities.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:54.599
She was a good dancer.

00:31:55.039 --> 00:31:56.359
Too bad

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.119
she can't stand now.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.640
Where'd you get this?

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.480
You asked me to investigate.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.200
So I scraped data

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.039
from all her contacts

00:32:05.119 --> 00:32:07.119
and associates' social media

00:32:07.119 --> 00:32:08.640
I could get my hands on.

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.400
But her husband

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.160
barely uses

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.000
social media.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.119
He's either super disciplined

00:32:15.319 --> 00:32:16.599
or extremely cautious.

00:32:17.319 --> 00:32:18.359
What did you find?

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.000
Bai Xiaoling

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.640
had many suitors in school.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.599
But she only had one boyfriend.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:27.720
An older alumnus.

00:32:28.279 --> 00:32:29.799
After graduation, he went abroad.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.799
She stayed single for years.

00:32:32.279 --> 00:32:33.559
Then she got married

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.119
three years ago.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:36.839
How's marriage like?

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.240
No idea.

00:32:38.319 --> 00:32:39.279
I've never been married.

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.280
I'm asking about Bai Xiaoling.

00:32:43.799 --> 00:32:44.759
She only posted

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.960
superficial stuff

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.440
after she got married.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.400
I can't tell much.

00:32:49.759 --> 00:32:51.119
But others' comments

00:32:51.559 --> 00:32:52.279
show that

00:32:52.279 --> 00:32:53.519
people quite envy her.

00:32:56.119 --> 00:32:57.200
She has an admirer

00:32:57.519 --> 00:32:58.160
named Zhang Ye.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:59.759
He kept liking

00:33:00.079 --> 00:33:01.039
her posts

00:33:01.279 --> 00:33:02.960
and kissing up to her.

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.519
But last December,

00:33:04.799 --> 00:33:05.880
he disappeared.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.279
I think he got blocked.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.799
I don't think

00:33:10.279 --> 00:33:12.000
he would give up so easily.

00:33:13.519 --> 00:33:14.599
Nothing else?

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.200
This is all

00:33:16.279 --> 00:33:17.319
I could dig up.

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:18.960
Dude,

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.440
I'm not a cop.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:21.319
This is

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.519
good enough.

00:33:22.759 --> 00:33:23.319
Fine.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.279
I didn't expect you

00:33:24.319 --> 00:33:25.279
to surprise me anyway.

00:33:26.759 --> 00:33:28.559
I spent two hours searching.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.119
You wouldn't

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.119
get this much info in days.

00:33:36.119 --> 00:33:36.799
What's your game?

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.079
Trying to hit on a married rich lady?

00:33:40.599 --> 00:33:41.440
Idiot.

00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:42.720
It's an investigation.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:43.720
Send me

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:44.920
everything you found.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:53.839
An extra document for you.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:55.559
What is it?

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.960

How to Charm Rich Ladies.

00:33:58.319 --> 00:33:58.880
Get lost.

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:00.400
Sent it.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.559

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.199

00:34:26.836 --> 00:34:30.320

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.960
Forget everything starting today.

00:35:12.599 --> 00:35:13.480
How can I forget?

00:35:14.599 --> 00:35:16.039
Then never bring it up.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.360
Pretend this person

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.000
never existed.

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.119
From now on,

00:35:22.639 --> 00:35:24.440
neither of us should bring it up

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.639
unless we want a divorce.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.000
Alright.

00:35:41.159 --> 00:35:42.000
This dirty secret

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.280
stays buried forever.

00:36:20.403 --> 00:36:23.104
If you came back with a woman,
even if she wasn't your wife...

00:36:23.923 --> 00:36:24.895
My brother-in-law.

00:36:25.939 --> 00:36:27.551
That was wrong.

00:36:28.403 --> 00:36:29.461
How much?

00:36:30.892 --> 00:36:31.936
Well, I wasn't finished.

00:36:31.936 --> 00:36:33.184
What? There's more?

00:36:33.184 --> 00:36:34.112
- Yes.
- Yeah.

00:36:34.112 --> 00:36:35.488
- Stop.
- Alright. Stop.

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.627
My dad's in the hospital.

00:36:37.651 --> 00:36:39.712
We can't get a single penny...

00:36:39.712 --> 00:36:40.960
Get... No, it's wrong.

00:36:42.816 --> 00:36:44.800
Imagine a market with security guards.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.208
The captain retires

00:36:46.208 --> 00:36:48.640

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:49.312
Sorry, one more.

00:36:49.312 --> 00:36:50.528
Alright. Stop. Again.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.864
To prove himself worthy as a leader,

00:36:52.864 --> 00:36:55.328
he'll be stricter with former colleagues

00:36:55.328 --> 00:36:56.416
more than necessary.

00:36:56.416 --> 00:36:57.696
He won't hesitate to scold

00:36:57.696 --> 00:36:58.761
without mercy...

00:37:02.432 --> 00:37:05.312
- Scold and punish them. And what?
- Okay.

00:37:05.312 --> 00:37:07.872
Help me phrase the next line.

00:37:08.416 --> 00:37:09.536
Sichuanese.

The whole village.

00:37:11.988 --> 00:37:12.960
The whole village...

Don't you farm the land?

00:37:14.944 --> 00:37:16.032
Don't you farm the land?

00:37:16.032 --> 00:37:17.065
Forget it.

The whole village...

Don't you farm the land?

Bai Xiaoling's a rich heiress.

00:37:23.392 --> 00:37:24.704
And a...

00:37:24.704 --> 00:37:25.888
A businesswoman.

00:37:25.888 --> 00:37:26.784
Businesswoman.

00:37:27.604 --> 00:37:29.536
I want to ask your monthly rate.

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:31.616
I'm sorry.

00:37:31.936 --> 00:37:33.452
I'm her permanent hire.

00:37:34.272 --> 00:37:36.000
Add more hand gestures when speaking.

00:37:36.384 --> 00:37:37.600
He's no...

00:37:37.888 --> 00:37:39.443
He's no Monet.

00:37:39.443 --> 00:37:40.608
- Be natural.
- Yes.

00:37:40.608 --> 00:37:42.499
You can move a bit.

00:37:42.584 --> 00:37:44.384
Don't rush.

00:37:44.384 --> 00:37:45.407
He's no Monet.

00:37:45.407 --> 00:37:46.243
Too dull.

- working on it...
- Don't be so direct.

No need...
