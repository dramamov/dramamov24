00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:20.333
EP 07
EUN-SU, HUI-SU, AND JIN-YOUNG

00:00:32.637 --> 00:00:34.097
Mind if I hop in?

00:00:47.944 --> 00:00:49.195
Where are you headed?

00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:05.336
DETECTIVE KANG JU-YEON

00:01:17.056 --> 00:01:18.683
I'm driving. Let me call you back.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.980
DETECTIVE KANG JU-YEON
CALL ENDED

00:01:32.363 --> 00:01:34.699
SEOUL SEOCHO POLICE STATION

00:02:11.694 --> 00:02:13.029
Who are you?

00:02:17.116 --> 00:02:18.034
Damn it!

00:02:23.498 --> 00:02:24.374
Who are you?

00:02:24.457 --> 00:02:25.667
The fuck do you care?

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.502
Don't get in my way, and get lost!

00:02:46.145 --> 00:02:47.480
Fuck you!

00:02:48.356 --> 00:02:49.232
Stop there!

00:02:53.403 --> 00:02:55.613
You… Do you know me?

00:02:55.697 --> 00:02:57.115
And you?

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:59.701
How'd you manage to track me down?

00:03:00.576 --> 00:03:02.704
Did Jo Eun-su fool you too?

00:03:03.955 --> 00:03:04.789
"Jo Eun-su"?

00:03:04.872 --> 00:03:05.873
Damn it.

00:03:09.377 --> 00:03:11.129
What did I do wrong?

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.508
What the fuck are you doing?

00:03:18.052 --> 00:03:19.137
Uncuff me, damn it!

00:03:21.306 --> 00:03:22.974
I said uncuff me.

00:03:23.057 --> 00:03:25.393
You hear me? Uncuff me already.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.148
Jin-pyo?

00:03:34.861 --> 00:03:36.696
Why do you have my brother's phone?

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.281
I found it.

00:03:39.198 --> 00:03:40.742
What, is that a crime now?

00:03:45.163 --> 00:03:46.205
Fuck.

00:03:52.754 --> 00:03:53.921
Give me the phone.

00:03:54.005 --> 00:03:56.174
I said give me the damn phone!

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:08.644
JO HUI-SU

00:04:10.313 --> 00:04:11.230
Hui-su?

00:04:11.731 --> 00:04:14.025
JO HUI-SU

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.656
You. Do you know Jo Hui-su?

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.991
Why did you call her?

00:04:23.076 --> 00:04:24.660
Just uncuff me already.

00:04:24.744 --> 00:04:27.455
Calling Hui-su
and extorting money from Mom.

00:04:28.456 --> 00:04:29.374
Was it all Jin-pyo?

00:04:32.585 --> 00:04:33.920
Did he put you up to it?

00:04:38.674 --> 00:04:40.176
Well, fuck me.

00:04:42.637 --> 00:04:44.097
I got spooked for nothing.

00:04:45.223 --> 00:04:46.057
Yeah?

00:04:57.485 --> 00:04:59.862
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
You will be…

00:04:59.946 --> 00:05:03.116
Are you still at work?
Why aren't you answering?

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.376
If Jang Kang calls you today,
don't pick up.

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:14.919
I'll settle this for good.

00:05:32.103 --> 00:05:35.106
JO HUI-SU

00:05:42.238 --> 00:05:44.949
Hello? Are you there, Mr. Jang Kang?

00:05:45.908 --> 00:05:46.951
Mr. Jang?

00:06:07.346 --> 00:06:09.474
MR. JIN SO-BAEK

00:06:15.563 --> 00:06:16.397
Yes, Mr. Jin.

00:06:17.064 --> 00:06:18.983
Hey, Hui-su.

00:06:19.484 --> 00:06:21.569
I need you to come to the warehouse now.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.200
Eun-su's on her way over too.

00:06:29.035 --> 00:06:32.163
Like I said, Detective,
I can only give you 30 minutes.

00:07:04.862 --> 00:07:05.696
A tattoo?

00:07:09.283 --> 00:07:11.494
Why do you have my brother's phone?

00:07:23.923 --> 00:07:26.050
Jin-pyo didn't leave the country that day.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.216
It's a different suitcase.

00:08:10.553 --> 00:08:11.512
No way.

00:08:13.306 --> 00:08:14.265
In there?

00:08:50.259 --> 00:08:55.681
JO EUN-SU

00:08:55.765 --> 00:08:56.724
Oh, wow.

00:08:57.975 --> 00:08:58.934
Noh Jin-pyo,

00:09:00.394 --> 00:09:02.688
he's here, isn't he?

00:09:35.304 --> 00:09:36.806
These two are friends?

00:09:58.077 --> 00:09:59.036
Shit.

00:10:37.616 --> 00:10:38.617
Jo Hui-su.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.121
It was you?

00:10:45.082 --> 00:10:46.250
You killed him?

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.301
Fortunately, it was just a minor graze.

00:10:55.384 --> 00:10:57.178
Nothing to lose sleep over.

00:10:59.305 --> 00:11:00.306
Then, excuse me.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:02.183
Thank you, sir.

00:11:14.487 --> 00:11:15.613
Hui-su.

00:11:16.363 --> 00:11:17.448
What were you thinking?

00:11:17.948 --> 00:11:20.868
It's not like you don't know
how dangerous Jang Kang is!

00:11:23.454 --> 00:11:24.955
I thought I could take him.

00:11:25.039 --> 00:11:26.957
If something happens to you…

00:11:34.298 --> 00:11:35.591
After everything

00:11:36.175 --> 00:11:38.511
you went through to save me…

00:11:46.101 --> 00:11:48.062
It wasn't just to save you.

00:11:52.983 --> 00:11:55.611
All my life, I've just avoided things.

00:11:59.198 --> 00:12:02.243
I told myself
I didn't know any better as a kid.

00:12:02.743 --> 00:12:04.245
Then, after I left home,

00:12:04.328 --> 00:12:08.165
I told myself, "Dad's getting old now,
so he probably won't hit Mom anymore."

00:12:09.542 --> 00:12:12.253
Even after I found out
he was still beating her…

00:12:14.797 --> 00:12:17.675
I was terrified to lose the life
I'd built for myself in Seoul,

00:12:17.758 --> 00:12:19.593
so I just ran away.

00:12:22.721 --> 00:12:25.641
Then I had a realization
after seeing what happened to Mrs. Kang.

00:12:26.141 --> 00:12:27.434
DEARLY DEPARTED
KANG HUI-YEON

00:12:27.518 --> 00:12:29.061
If I don't break the cycle,

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.564
this will never end.

00:12:36.193 --> 00:12:37.486
That's why I did it.

00:12:39.071 --> 00:12:40.781
It wasn't just for your sake.

00:12:41.282 --> 00:12:43.367
I wanted to break the cycle myself.

00:12:46.036 --> 00:12:47.705
So don't think like that.

00:12:55.254 --> 00:12:56.463
Does it hurt?

00:12:56.547 --> 00:12:57.798
Not one bit.

00:12:57.882 --> 00:12:59.258
I know you're lying.

00:12:59.758 --> 00:13:00.593
I mean it.

00:13:08.767 --> 00:13:11.812
At times, hard liquor serves as a remedy.

00:13:15.149 --> 00:13:17.109
Eun-su, you stay away from Jang Kang.

00:13:22.865 --> 00:13:24.491
How did you know?

00:13:24.575 --> 00:13:26.911
Nothing happens around here
without me knowing.

00:13:41.216 --> 00:13:44.178
I know exactly how you've both
been dancing on a razor's edge.

00:13:48.933 --> 00:13:49.767
Yes?

00:13:55.356 --> 00:13:57.858
You've been lucky
not to have gotten caught yet.

00:14:11.789 --> 00:14:15.626
You can spend a lifetime running,
but your memories will find you.

00:15:02.172 --> 00:15:05.968
It's been 20 years, but I can
still see myself drenched in blood.

00:15:17.563 --> 00:15:20.774
Then again, I can't say that
what you two did was entirely wrong.

00:15:25.154 --> 00:15:27.698
Jang Kang dropped
your husband's phone, and I saw it.

00:15:31.493 --> 00:15:33.579
Bastards like him are better off dead.

00:15:51.388 --> 00:15:52.681
I'll send Jang Kang back.

00:15:54.933 --> 00:15:55.768
Sorry?

00:15:59.063 --> 00:16:00.064
Why would you do that?

00:16:00.147 --> 00:16:03.150
You two don't stand a chance
against him, okay?

00:16:03.233 --> 00:16:06.737
That punk's survived
even the roughest slums of Shanghai.

00:16:07.362 --> 00:16:11.241
He's cunning enough to deceive me,
and I pride myself on judging character.

00:16:12.159 --> 00:16:15.871
-It's only right I handle a punk like him.
-He won't go without a fight.

00:16:16.413 --> 00:16:19.041
And you're not the type
to strike a losing deal.

00:16:19.124 --> 00:16:21.710
I believe I already took a loss once
because of you.

00:16:25.047 --> 00:16:27.091
I really appreciate your concern, but--

00:16:27.174 --> 00:16:29.635
If you appreciate it,
then just do as I say.

00:16:29.718 --> 00:16:30.969
I can't put you in danger--

00:16:31.053 --> 00:16:32.346
Save it.

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:33.972
You work for me.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.810
And you might end up working for me.

00:16:39.645 --> 00:16:42.231
So just accept the help
that's being offered to you.

00:16:46.735 --> 00:16:47.820
I couldn't find him.

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:51.031
There's also something else.

00:16:51.115 --> 00:16:54.993
She suddenly veered off, so I thought
maybe she wasn't tailing us after all.

00:16:56.453 --> 00:16:57.913
But then,

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.749
oddly enough, she returned to that road.

00:17:03.377 --> 00:17:05.212
First, run the license plate.

00:17:07.172 --> 00:17:09.508
And have someone keep watch
at Jang Kang's motel.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.219
Yeah, okay.

00:17:16.723 --> 00:17:18.183
We found the phone.

00:17:19.226 --> 00:17:20.561
Thank you, sir.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:25.941
Did you happen to notice
a woman tailing your car last night?

00:17:38.996 --> 00:17:40.539
PSYCHOACTIVE DRUG
ZOLPIEM

00:18:13.947 --> 00:18:15.157
Where is this place?

00:18:17.951 --> 00:18:18.785
Jang Kang.

00:18:21.747 --> 00:18:25.042
Hand over any copies of the videos
or photos on Jin-pyo's phone.

00:18:29.588 --> 00:18:31.506
You're not even asking if he's alive--

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:33.300
Do you have any or not? Yes or no?

00:18:43.602 --> 00:18:45.020
You'd better start talking,

00:18:46.063 --> 00:18:48.357
because I know
you killed that security guard.

00:18:51.193 --> 00:18:52.569
I didn't kill him.

00:18:53.946 --> 00:18:55.405
Noh Jin-pyo did.

00:19:11.088 --> 00:19:12.589
Do you have any copies or not?

00:19:15.509 --> 00:19:16.426
I don't.

00:19:18.804 --> 00:19:20.806
That's more like it.

00:20:21.199 --> 00:20:24.745
THE FIRST FEMALE COMMISSIONER GENERAL
NOH JIN-YOUNG!

00:20:44.431 --> 00:20:45.349
Jin-young.

00:20:46.141 --> 00:20:47.142
Did I wake you?

00:20:47.934 --> 00:20:48.935
Jin-pyo.

00:20:49.728 --> 00:20:50.812
Did you find him?

00:20:58.403 --> 00:20:59.571
I'm still looking.

00:21:02.032 --> 00:21:03.241
Are you drinking again?

00:21:04.785 --> 00:21:06.578
No, I'm not.

00:21:06.661 --> 00:21:09.623
I just had a sip left from an old bottle.

00:21:09.706 --> 00:21:12.709
Search for yourself. You won't find
a single bottle of liquor here.

00:21:12.793 --> 00:21:14.503
I won't help bury your next DUI.

00:21:14.586 --> 00:21:15.879
I know that.

00:21:22.177 --> 00:21:25.222
I need to get my car checked,
so I'll be using yours for a few days.

00:21:26.348 --> 00:21:29.684
My building's lot is under construction,
so I'll leave my car here.

00:21:29.768 --> 00:21:32.312
It smells awful
from all the crime scenes it's been to,

00:21:32.396 --> 00:21:34.481
so whatever you do,
don't go into the garage.

00:21:55.252 --> 00:21:58.004
MOVING SELECTED ITEMS TO TRASH

00:21:58.088 --> 00:21:59.089
NO PHOTOS OR VIDEOS

00:22:09.057 --> 00:22:10.892
LICENSE PLATE SEARCH RESULTS

00:22:10.976 --> 00:22:14.146
LICENSE PLATE: 13M 6925
NAME: NOH JIN-YOUNG

00:22:17.357 --> 00:22:18.358
"Noh Jin-young."

00:22:29.411 --> 00:22:31.413
Hui-su, your husband's name
was Noh Jin-pyo.

00:22:31.496 --> 00:22:32.706
Is Jin-young his sister?

00:22:33.999 --> 00:22:34.958
How did you know?

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:39.129
So the car that tailed me yesterday was--

00:22:39.212 --> 00:22:40.422
Noh Jin-young's car.

00:22:41.631 --> 00:22:45.719
Manager Ma says her car was in sight
at the time Jang Kang entered yours.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:49.598
She must have tailed you,
knowing everything.

00:22:50.557 --> 00:22:53.435
There's no way Jin-young would know
Eun-su or Jang Kang.

00:22:53.518 --> 00:22:56.646
She hasn't visited recently
nor have we spoken on the phone.

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:58.273
But she's with the police.

00:22:58.356 --> 00:22:59.399
MA HAE-RYONG

00:23:00.525 --> 00:23:01.485
Police?

00:23:01.568 --> 00:23:05.780
If she had known about Jang Kang,
she would have called you first.

00:23:05.864 --> 00:23:07.407
She didn't call.

00:23:07.491 --> 00:23:10.827
I figured Jang Kang would call
and blow up after yesterday,

00:23:10.911 --> 00:23:11.995
but he hasn't called.

00:23:13.079 --> 00:23:15.916
I actually called Jang Kang last night.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:17.626
JO HUI-SU

00:23:18.543 --> 00:23:20.378
He hung up without saying a word.

00:23:25.133 --> 00:23:27.010
Given their silence, it seems as though

00:23:27.761 --> 00:23:29.346
Noh Jin-young has Jang Kang.

00:23:32.891 --> 00:23:35.644
Ms. Noh Jin-young,
I look forward to working with you.

00:23:39.523 --> 00:23:40.899
I'll do my best, ma'am.

00:23:40.982 --> 00:23:44.236
I have no doubt about your capabilities,

00:23:44.736 --> 00:23:46.446
so let me give you a word of advice.

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:47.364
Of course.

00:23:47.447 --> 00:23:50.158
As long as you're here,
keep your circle in check.

00:23:51.743 --> 00:23:54.204
No matter how capable you are,

00:23:54.287 --> 00:23:57.207
if your reputation takes a hit,
there won't be any exceptions.

00:23:59.209 --> 00:24:00.585
I'll keep that in mind.

00:24:03.547 --> 00:24:08.468
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

00:24:10.095 --> 00:24:11.513
Jin-pyo's already dead.

00:24:12.597 --> 00:24:14.599
If that's a constant
that can't be changed…

00:24:19.104 --> 00:24:21.523
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

00:24:21.606 --> 00:24:22.607
…I must change…

00:24:24.609 --> 00:24:25.819
the variable.

00:24:33.535 --> 00:24:34.619
Fifteenth floor.

00:24:44.337 --> 00:24:45.338
Eun-su?

00:24:47.257 --> 00:24:48.633
Were you expecting someone?

00:24:48.717 --> 00:24:52.345
Just the girl downstairs.
She's got my food container.

00:25:01.021 --> 00:25:01.855
Hey, Eun-su.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.114
Eun-su?

00:25:16.995 --> 00:25:19.205
Sorry, I thought you were someone else.

00:25:19.706 --> 00:25:21.291
LEE HYEON-JI

00:25:58.828 --> 00:26:00.455
When did I get blood on here?

00:27:17.407 --> 00:27:18.324
Hello, ma'am.

00:27:21.661 --> 00:27:24.622
I've never seen such a doting husband.

00:27:26.499 --> 00:27:28.126
Could you testify to that later?

00:27:29.294 --> 00:27:30.128
Sorry?

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.719
Could I please get the 2026 SS catalog?

00:27:41.431 --> 00:27:45.018
Not everyone who showers his wife
with expensive gifts loves her.

00:27:48.354 --> 00:27:50.857
He could just be trying
to cover something up.

00:28:08.416 --> 00:28:10.293
Hey, I'm listening.

00:28:16.174 --> 00:28:19.677
I think Noh Jin-young knows
about Jang Kang and Noh Jin-pyo.

00:29:06.266 --> 00:29:08.351
MOTHER

00:29:08.434 --> 00:29:11.980
Today's specials are white ragu
and truffle paccheri.

00:29:15.191 --> 00:29:19.028
Both are my daughter-in-law's favorites,
so please make them extra delicious.

00:29:19.112 --> 00:29:19.946
Yes, ma'am.

00:29:27.245 --> 00:29:28.246
Mother.

00:29:31.249 --> 00:29:32.333
Jin-pyo

00:29:33.376 --> 00:29:34.752
is back, isn't he?

00:29:35.545 --> 00:29:36.379
Sorry?

00:29:38.006 --> 00:29:40.258
That was Jin-pyo, right?

00:29:49.726 --> 00:29:50.852
Where is he?

00:29:53.146 --> 00:29:53.980
Mother.

00:29:54.063 --> 00:29:56.649
Where is he?
Why didn't you tell me he was back?

00:29:59.652 --> 00:30:02.447
So you knew everything.

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.993
You looked the other way
when I was in desperate need,

00:30:07.952 --> 00:30:09.746
and you point this out now?

00:30:09.829 --> 00:30:11.122
Now's not the time to nitpick.

00:30:12.415 --> 00:30:15.209
If you won't stop Jin-pyo
turning up to my lectures in rags

00:30:15.293 --> 00:30:18.046
to ask for money, send him to me.
I'll take care of him.

00:30:47.033 --> 00:30:49.661
She must have tailed you,
knowing everything.

00:30:54.666 --> 00:30:55.875
Jin-young.

00:30:59.671 --> 00:31:01.047
So you were home.

00:31:04.842 --> 00:31:06.302
What brings you here?

00:31:06.386 --> 00:31:08.304
You were caught on a dashcam.

00:31:10.723 --> 00:31:11.849
Sorry?

00:31:14.394 --> 00:31:16.437
On the night the security guard died,

00:31:17.271 --> 00:31:21.609
you were caught on the dashcam of a car
that drove past the crime scene.

00:31:25.321 --> 00:31:27.323
I went to the car to get something.

00:31:27.407 --> 00:31:29.617
But you weren't alone in the footage.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.328
I believe Jin-pyo

00:31:33.538 --> 00:31:34.956
was caught on camera too.

00:31:41.504 --> 00:31:42.672
That's impossible.

00:31:45.967 --> 00:31:47.135
That's what I'm saying.

00:31:47.885 --> 00:31:49.178
It makes no sense.

00:31:51.556 --> 00:31:54.100
But Mom's been saying strange things too.

00:31:55.768 --> 00:31:57.895
She first said that she saw Jin-pyo,

00:31:59.147 --> 00:32:00.898
then acted like she'd imagined it.

00:32:03.609 --> 00:32:04.444
So I came here

00:32:06.112 --> 00:32:07.447
to ask you.

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:12.994
About what?

00:32:16.831 --> 00:32:17.665
Hui-su.

00:32:20.668 --> 00:32:22.128
Where's Jin-pyo?

00:32:25.798 --> 00:32:28.676
He's in Shanghai right now, isn't he?

00:32:34.974 --> 00:32:38.227
That's right. He's in Shanghai.

00:32:40.396 --> 00:32:41.230
Jin-pyo…

00:32:44.859 --> 00:32:46.110
should return soon, right?

00:32:49.363 --> 00:32:50.198
Yes.

00:33:12.303 --> 00:33:13.137
Yeah?

00:33:15.014 --> 00:33:16.724
She drove her mom's car?

00:33:22.021 --> 00:33:24.398
And we're sure she didn't turn him in?

00:33:26.234 --> 00:33:27.068
Right.

00:33:27.819 --> 00:33:29.487
Go to Ko Jeong-suk's place for now.

00:33:30.321 --> 00:33:31.239
Okay.

00:33:32.615 --> 00:33:35.076
By Ko Jeong-suk,
do you mean Noh Jin-young's mom?

00:33:35.159 --> 00:33:36.077
Why? What about it?

00:33:37.453 --> 00:33:39.789
I think I know why
Noh Jin-young's been silent.

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:43.459
She asked her circle to lie low
for her job at the president's office.

00:33:45.962 --> 00:33:48.214
That's all the way at the top.

00:33:51.634 --> 00:33:52.885
So, until then…

00:33:52.969 --> 00:33:56.389
What if Noh Jin-young
hid Jang Kang in her car?

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:05.106
He'll call us back.

00:34:06.274 --> 00:34:07.358
Don't worry about it.

00:35:03.456 --> 00:35:04.373
Yes?

00:35:05.666 --> 00:35:06.667
I see.

00:35:07.335 --> 00:35:08.878
From the department store?

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:10.254
Of course.

00:35:10.338 --> 00:35:12.423
Thank you. Please have a seat.

00:35:12.506 --> 00:35:13.341
Thank you.

00:35:15.176 --> 00:35:18.137
We would be so honored
if you could give a lecture

00:35:18.221 --> 00:35:20.181
for some of our most esteemed customers.

00:35:20.264 --> 00:35:23.559
Thank you for taking the time to meet me
on such short notice.

00:35:23.643 --> 00:35:25.144
When I was raising my children,

00:35:25.228 --> 00:35:28.397
there wasn't a single day
we didn't have flowers in our home.

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:32.235
In our house, flowers came before food.

00:35:33.277 --> 00:35:35.905
Thanks to that, my children grew up

00:35:35.988 --> 00:35:40.868
to be gentle, kind-hearted adults,
like the flowers they were surrounded by.

00:35:41.953 --> 00:35:42.954
I see.

00:35:43.955 --> 00:35:47.959
And I'm sure your VVIP customers
must be some of the most…

00:35:51.504 --> 00:35:53.506
I'm so sorry, Ms. Ko.

00:35:53.589 --> 00:35:56.467
I need to take this call.
Please excuse me for a moment.

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:57.385
Of course.

00:35:59.262 --> 00:36:01.931
I stepped out for an urgent meeting.

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:35.631
Jang Kang?

00:36:37.216 --> 00:36:39.343
It's me, Jo Eun-su.
Hang in there for a moment.

00:36:59.113 --> 00:36:59.947
Jang Kang.

00:37:00.906 --> 00:37:01.741
Jang Kang?

00:37:33.981 --> 00:37:35.941
Disable the alarm before security arrives.

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:44.617
JO EUN-SU

00:38:08.349 --> 00:38:10.476
I'm a bit hesitant to bring this up…

00:38:13.312 --> 00:38:16.232
but Hui-su insisted
the security guard was spying on her.

00:38:16.899 --> 00:38:19.360
I stopped her more than once
from filing a report.

00:38:21.529 --> 00:38:24.031
It seems she even threatened him
without any proof.

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.787
I'm sure it's a coincidence,
but that same guard ended up dead.

00:38:30.329 --> 00:38:32.748
The news rattled me,
so I went to his office that day.

00:38:33.582 --> 00:38:34.500
I see.

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:41.882
Thankfully, though, a couple who happened
to be leaving the lot around that time

00:38:41.966 --> 00:38:44.343
gave a statement
in your sister-in-law's favor.

00:38:44.844 --> 00:38:45.678
Right.

00:38:47.388 --> 00:38:48.431
That's a relief.

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:56.230
And thanks for not saying anything
at the substation last time.

00:38:58.023 --> 00:38:58.858
Sorry?

00:39:00.693 --> 00:39:03.195
Right, don't mention it, Jin-young.

00:39:05.948 --> 00:39:07.741
I couldn't say anything back then,

00:39:08.242 --> 00:39:09.326
but the truth is

00:39:10.244 --> 00:39:14.165
my sister-in-law hurt herself and tried
to report it as domestic violence.

00:39:15.958 --> 00:39:18.961
That's why she scurried out
as soon as she saw me that day.

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:27.845
I only dropped by for a coffee,
but I've kept you too long.

00:39:28.762 --> 00:39:30.806
-Let's grab a drink sometime.
-Yes, of course.

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:32.016
Take care.

00:39:39.607 --> 00:39:40.441
Hello?

00:39:44.612 --> 00:39:46.071
What did you say?

00:39:56.916 --> 00:39:58.250
Shit.

00:40:06.467 --> 00:40:07.801
-Jin-young.
-Mom.

00:40:08.677 --> 00:40:11.931
-You didn't call the police, did you?
-You told me not to.

00:40:12.014 --> 00:40:15.100
-Check if anything's missing.
-I'll check the security footage first.

00:40:15.184 --> 00:40:16.810
Hey, don't bother checking.

00:40:18.395 --> 00:40:20.523
It was the woman
from the department store.

00:40:21.023 --> 00:40:22.775
Who'd have known she was a thief?

00:40:23.651 --> 00:40:24.485
Hold on.

00:40:25.277 --> 00:40:26.403
The department store?

00:40:26.904 --> 00:40:27.738
Yes.

00:40:37.998 --> 00:40:39.625
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:40:41.043 --> 00:40:44.004
I had no other choice.
If I had just left Jang Kang there--

00:40:46.465 --> 00:40:48.050
Didn't I say I'd send him back?

00:40:49.802 --> 00:40:51.720
So you brought him out here. What now?

00:40:51.804 --> 00:40:53.806
Where exactly were you going to take him?

00:40:53.889 --> 00:40:55.558
Does this road even lead somewhere?

00:40:56.976 --> 00:40:59.311
Where on earth
were you planning to take him?

00:41:07.278 --> 00:41:09.530
What if you'd gotten yourself hurt?

00:41:28.966 --> 00:41:30.718
JINGANG CHINESE MARKET

00:41:51.155 --> 00:41:53.616
I'm shipping Jang Kang back tonight.

00:41:54.366 --> 00:41:55.200
Okay.

00:41:55.909 --> 00:41:57.328
Noh Jin-pyo too.

00:41:58.829 --> 00:41:59.663
Sorry?

00:42:00.164 --> 00:42:01.290
Mr. Jin.

00:42:01.373 --> 00:42:06.003
Noh Jin-pyo left for Shanghai
a month and a half ago and died there.

00:42:10.299 --> 00:42:12.801
If you're going out of your way to help us

00:42:12.885 --> 00:42:15.220
because of what you said
at the hangover soup place,

00:42:15.304 --> 00:42:16.388
there's really no need.

00:42:16.472 --> 00:42:19.767
I was so out of it that day
that I don't remember what you said.

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:21.977
And if you leave Noh Jin-pyo here…

00:42:25.522 --> 00:42:27.524
do you actually have a solution?

00:42:44.291 --> 00:42:47.044
Back in 1999,
at Gangneung Chodang Police Substation.

00:42:52.091 --> 00:42:53.175
Do you remember that?

00:42:53.884 --> 00:42:56.637
EMERGENCY CALL INCIDENT REPORT

00:43:01.141 --> 00:43:02.518
You were eight at the time.

00:43:08.982 --> 00:43:10.693
This is quite harsh, don't you think?

00:43:11.193 --> 00:43:14.321
I get reported for cranking up the volume
to watch some wrestling?

00:43:18.283 --> 00:43:20.786
I slipped and fell
while cleaning the bathroom.

00:43:21.495 --> 00:43:23.831
All right, then.
Is there anyone else at home?

00:43:24.331 --> 00:43:25.958
It's okay. You can come out.

00:43:27.209 --> 00:43:28.043
Hey.

00:43:29.878 --> 00:43:30.838
Hey, kiddo.

00:43:30.921 --> 00:43:33.924
Did you hear any fighting
or yelling at home?

00:43:35.884 --> 00:43:38.846
I was asleep, so I didn't hear anything.

00:43:39.972 --> 00:43:43.976
My brother and I
were playing hide-and-seek,

00:43:44.059 --> 00:43:45.978
and I fell asleep in the closet…

00:43:49.982 --> 00:43:51.900
You turned a blind eye yourself,

00:43:52.776 --> 00:43:55.320
so why meddle
in someone else's family affairs now?

00:43:56.071 --> 00:44:00.033
Does it make you feel like you've become
some kind of crusader for justice?

00:44:01.577 --> 00:44:03.746
What do you even get

00:44:04.246 --> 00:44:07.666
out of meddling in Jo Hui-su's life,
besides being branded…

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.170
a murderer and kidnapper?

00:44:14.423 --> 00:44:16.133
I guess I'll find out soon enough.

00:44:16.216 --> 00:44:18.343
I don't need Jang Kang to get you two--

00:44:24.183 --> 00:44:26.393
MR. JIN SO-BAEK

00:44:26.477 --> 00:44:28.479
Your call cannot be connected. Please…

00:44:28.562 --> 00:44:30.105
MR. JIN SO-BAEK

00:44:36.945 --> 00:44:38.030
Mr. Jin.

00:44:38.947 --> 00:44:40.908
Please send Noh Jin-pyo off as well.

00:44:54.713 --> 00:44:55.756
Pipe down!

00:44:59.134 --> 00:45:00.469
Where's Jo Eun-su?

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:03.597
Bring her here.

00:45:04.598 --> 00:45:05.682
Jo Eun-su!

00:45:06.391 --> 00:45:07.434
Hey, you punk.

00:45:08.018 --> 00:45:10.604
You'll be hauled off
in the hull of a boat tonight.

00:45:10.687 --> 00:45:11.980
Don't tell me what to do!

00:45:38.173 --> 00:45:39.341
Jo Hui-su.

00:45:42.302 --> 00:45:45.931
After getting caught siphoning off
her husband Noh Jin-pyo's money,

00:45:47.558 --> 00:45:50.477
she injured herself
and made it look like domestic violence

00:45:51.728 --> 00:45:53.772
to blackmail her husband.

00:45:57.651 --> 00:45:59.820
In the end,
driven by her greed for more money,

00:46:00.988 --> 00:46:03.407
she conspired with Jo Eun-su,
a long-time friend.

00:46:08.537 --> 00:46:12.082
Together, they killed her doting husband
and buried his body.

00:46:25.721 --> 00:46:27.055
And his body…

00:46:32.978 --> 00:46:34.271
Drop the act.

00:46:42.946 --> 00:46:45.365
Water, please. Water.

00:47:11.141 --> 00:47:12.059
Fuck!

00:47:13.143 --> 00:47:15.437
What do you think

00:47:15.938 --> 00:47:19.274
is the first thing I'll do
once I get to Shanghai tomorrow morning?

00:47:20.025 --> 00:47:21.568
I'll hunt down your family

00:47:22.194 --> 00:47:24.529
and kill every fucking last one of them!

00:47:42.005 --> 00:47:43.256
Right here.

00:47:54.935 --> 00:47:55.769
Hey.

00:47:59.231 --> 00:48:00.065
Take care

00:48:00.899 --> 00:48:02.067
of yourself.

00:48:25.132 --> 00:48:26.883
Fucking hell.

00:48:35.559 --> 00:48:36.685
Noh Jin-pyo.

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:38.478
I know where he's buried.

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:44.443
You'd never get it out of those bitches.

00:48:46.361 --> 00:48:47.571
We'll find his body…

00:48:49.573 --> 00:48:51.199
and screw those bitches over.

00:48:58.415 --> 00:48:59.499
What's in it for you?

00:49:00.083 --> 00:49:01.376
Three billion.

00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:06.465
I shaved off a hundred million.

00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:14.264
Get in.

00:49:17.768 --> 00:49:19.102
Well, fuck me.

00:49:20.604 --> 00:49:21.438
Deal?

00:49:25.776 --> 00:49:27.277
Must you go through with this?

00:49:28.987 --> 00:49:30.572
Some of this is on me.

00:49:37.037 --> 00:49:37.954
WI CHUN-GIL

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:49.466
-Great job today.
-See you tomorrow, ma'am.

00:49:58.517 --> 00:50:02.062
Hey. Mr. Jin told us
to carry around our passports

00:50:02.562 --> 00:50:04.856
and some essentials, just in case.

00:50:06.942 --> 00:50:10.195
Yes. I just got off work,
so I'll be there soon.

00:50:10.904 --> 00:50:11.822
Hui-su.

00:50:15.742 --> 00:50:17.202
Never mind. Let's talk in person.

00:50:18.912 --> 00:50:19.746
Sure.

00:50:28.004 --> 00:50:29.047
Yes, Mr. Jin?

00:50:40.308 --> 00:50:41.309
MR. JIN SO-BAEK

00:50:43.019 --> 00:50:46.273
Head to the mahjong club with Hui-su now.
Make sure to lock the doors.

00:50:48.066 --> 00:50:49.568
-Turn the car around.
-Yes, sir.

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:32.152
Fuck.

00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:35.780
For fuck's sake!

00:51:57.969 --> 00:51:59.137
Look.

00:52:03.767 --> 00:52:04.851
What did I tell you?

00:52:17.948 --> 00:52:18.865
Fuck!

00:52:22.702 --> 00:52:23.703
The fuck is this?

00:52:24.913 --> 00:52:26.289
That's fucking ominous.

00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:49.521
I'm sure he was here. How…

00:52:50.814 --> 00:52:51.648
This…

00:52:53.441 --> 00:52:54.859
I swear this is the spot.

00:52:58.488 --> 00:53:01.116
Grab a fucking shovel and help, will you?

00:53:02.909 --> 00:53:04.953
I'm not fucking doing this
just for me, am I?

00:53:29.519 --> 00:53:30.562
Noh Jin-pyo.

00:53:32.272 --> 00:53:33.565
You'll have to take his place.

00:53:59.257 --> 00:54:01.217
MEDICAL CERTIFICATE OF BODILY HARM

00:54:05.972 --> 00:54:08.433
MEDICAL CERTIFICATE OF BODILY HARM
JO HUI-SU

00:54:14.481 --> 00:54:16.483
Eight weeks' recovery for self-harm?

00:54:18.109 --> 00:54:20.653
There were clear signs of ongoing abuse.

00:54:21.988 --> 00:54:23.031
Are you sure, ma'am?

00:54:23.656 --> 00:54:24.699
I am.

00:54:54.646 --> 00:54:55.939
Hello, ma'am.

00:54:59.067 --> 00:55:01.319
I'm not sure if you remember me, but…

00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:05.240
Hello.

00:55:05.323 --> 00:55:09.202
I'm currently investigating the murder
of the security guard at this complex.

00:55:11.287 --> 00:55:12.122
I see.

00:55:13.164 --> 00:55:14.082
A while back, you…

00:55:16.918 --> 00:55:18.920
MEDICAL CERTIFICATE OF BODILY HARM

00:55:24.968 --> 00:55:26.302
The door is open.

00:55:33.768 --> 00:55:37.272
I truly apologize
for not verifying the domestic violence

00:55:37.772 --> 00:55:41.359
and taking immediate action back then.

00:55:50.535 --> 00:55:52.328
I'll get you a glass of water.

00:56:06.843 --> 00:56:07.677
Here.

00:56:09.053 --> 00:56:10.054
Thank you.

00:56:11.139 --> 00:56:11.973
Now,

00:56:13.016 --> 00:56:15.018
you went to the underground parking lot

00:56:15.518 --> 00:56:17.270
on the night the guard died, right?

00:56:21.441 --> 00:56:24.694
It's just for the investigation.
Answer however you feel comfortable.

00:56:26.446 --> 00:56:28.448
I went to get something from the car.

00:56:29.616 --> 00:56:32.952
I believe your car was parked
in front of your building.

00:56:34.704 --> 00:56:36.080
We confirmed that.

00:56:38.124 --> 00:56:40.502
I meant my husband's car.
I was running his errands.

00:56:41.002 --> 00:56:42.754
He just adores that car,

00:56:43.254 --> 00:56:45.423
so he always parks it
in the parking garage.

00:56:45.507 --> 00:56:46.424
Right.

00:56:49.761 --> 00:56:51.137
That will be all, then.

00:56:51.221 --> 00:56:53.097
Thank you very much for your cooperation.

00:56:53.181 --> 00:56:55.642
I'll reach out again
if we have any more questions.

00:56:55.725 --> 00:56:56.559
Sure.

00:56:59.562 --> 00:57:00.563
By any chance…

00:57:04.025 --> 00:57:05.902
are you in need of help right now?

00:57:10.198 --> 00:57:11.115
No,

00:57:11.991 --> 00:57:13.910
my husband's on a business trip.

00:57:17.288 --> 00:57:18.540
Thank you for asking.

00:57:24.837 --> 00:57:28.091
SENTINEL STUDIO APARTMENT

00:58:03.751 --> 00:58:04.752
JIN-YOUNG

00:58:17.682 --> 00:58:18.600
Eun-su.

00:58:20.977 --> 00:58:23.271
JIN-YOUNG

00:58:35.867 --> 00:58:38.578
Call Jo Eun-su and she dies.

00:58:39.162 --> 00:58:40.747
Same goes for Lee Hye-ok at Sangae.

00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:02.101
Eun-su has nothing to do with this.
I did everything alone.

00:59:02.185 --> 00:59:05.229
And my mom… Please just spare my mom.

00:59:06.272 --> 00:59:08.066
Jo Eun-su has nothing to do with this?

00:59:08.149 --> 00:59:09.609
MOM
I'M SORRY TO LEAVE YOU ALL ALONE

00:59:09.692 --> 00:59:12.695
She snuck into my mom's garage today
and took Jang Kang.

00:59:16.115 --> 00:59:18.701
Where is she now?
What have you done to her?

00:59:18.785 --> 00:59:21.037
It's Jo Eun-su who's done something.

00:59:21.537 --> 00:59:23.373
I'm the one who found Jang Kang

00:59:23.456 --> 00:59:25.333
beaten to a pulp and left for dead.

00:59:28.711 --> 00:59:31.464
I don't believe you.
Why should I trust anything you say?

00:59:31.547 --> 00:59:34.258
Think of everything Jo Eun-su did for you.

00:59:38.805 --> 00:59:39.972
Jo Eun-su…

00:59:41.974 --> 00:59:43.434
is insane.

00:59:45.770 --> 00:59:48.439
Who knows what else she'll do

00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:50.566
because of you?

00:59:56.823 --> 00:59:57.782
Am I wrong?

01:00:01.327 --> 01:00:02.245
Jo Hui-su.

01:00:02.745 --> 01:00:03.663
Just die.

01:00:10.128 --> 01:00:12.130
Then I'll let Jo Eun-su off the hook.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:13.881
And spare your mom.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:18.177
I was just appointed
to the president's office.

01:00:18.261 --> 01:00:20.054
Do you think I'd want this to blow up?

01:00:21.431 --> 01:00:23.182
It's not like my dead brother

01:00:23.266 --> 01:00:25.685
will come back
if I get you two put on trial.

01:00:30.314 --> 01:00:32.191
Still, one of you must pay the price.

01:00:35.278 --> 01:00:36.487
Since his body's been found,

01:00:36.571 --> 01:00:38.614
how much longer
do you think you can hold out?

01:00:39.407 --> 01:00:40.283
Let me help you.

01:00:42.827 --> 01:00:44.287
I just need you to die quietly.

01:00:46.372 --> 01:00:47.665
Then it'll all be over.

01:01:58.736 --> 01:02:01.823
EUN-SU

01:02:12.375 --> 01:02:13.417
Hey, Eun-su.

01:02:26.055 --> 01:02:27.473
What happened to your forehead?

01:02:28.266 --> 01:02:29.433
I just tripped.

01:02:31.936 --> 01:02:33.354
For real this time.

01:02:33.855 --> 01:02:35.982
I was sorting out
the things I put up for sale.

01:02:38.234 --> 01:02:40.194
-Let's go to the mahjong club.
-Okay.

01:02:40.862 --> 01:02:41.737
Let's go.

01:03:19.942 --> 01:03:22.445
-Hui-su.
-I was on edge all day.

01:03:23.696 --> 01:03:25.823
Hearing this helps me relax.

01:03:27.199 --> 01:03:28.326
You should sit too.

01:03:29.702 --> 01:03:30.536
Okay.

01:03:34.790 --> 01:03:37.919
Just like Mr. Jin, clatter, clatter.

01:03:38.502 --> 01:03:39.337
Hui-su--

01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:43.132
Do you remember the glazed chicken
we used to eat at Jungang Market

01:03:43.215 --> 01:03:44.759
after skipping last period?

01:03:47.345 --> 01:03:48.638
You mean Masan Granny's?

01:03:48.721 --> 01:03:51.724
Yeah! Their chicken was amazing.
I'm suddenly craving it.

01:03:52.433 --> 01:03:54.602
Do you think it's still open?
Probably, right?

01:03:55.102 --> 01:03:56.145
I don't know.

01:03:56.228 --> 01:03:58.606
The owner was already
pretty old back then.

01:03:58.689 --> 01:04:00.149
Give me a sec.

01:04:04.362 --> 01:04:05.196
It's still open.

01:04:08.449 --> 01:04:10.576
She hasn't changed a bit.

01:04:14.288 --> 01:04:17.667
She's getting great reviews too.

01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:19.043
Let's go eat there sometime.

01:04:20.795 --> 01:04:21.629
Okay.

01:04:21.712 --> 01:04:25.132
Hey, I'm feeling kind of hungry.
Aren't you?

01:04:31.889 --> 01:04:34.308
What's with the lipstick?
We're about to eat ramyeon.

01:04:35.434 --> 01:04:36.519
For old times' sake.

01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:44.360
I need the bathroom real quick.

01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:47.321
Okay, it should be ready
by the time you get back.

01:04:54.245 --> 01:04:55.371
Thank you, Eun-su.

01:04:58.833 --> 01:05:00.126
Hurry before they get soggy.

01:05:01.502 --> 01:05:02.336
Sure.

01:05:44.045 --> 01:05:46.839
EUN-SU

01:06:27.004 --> 01:06:29.090
MOM

01:06:29.173 --> 01:06:31.967
I COMMITTED AN UNFORGIVABLE SIN

01:06:32.051 --> 01:06:33.010
