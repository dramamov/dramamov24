[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.930
[Episode 26]

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.039
Master Shao was initially

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:36.400
hesitant indeed,

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.590
but then

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.080
Mr. Tang gave a passionate speech,

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.070
saying that you are

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.710
a role model
for the Sword Alliance's disciples.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.870
We support Mr. Tang

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.370
and will fight against the Fengliu Shop.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.009
Chunji,

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.110
who told you

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.090
all that nonsense just now?

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.509
All of you, come here!

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.760
Master Jiang.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.920
Uncle Master, please don't.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.550
Chunji, don't be afraid.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.960
I'll stand up for you.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.200
Will you dare

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.690
to speak nonsense again?

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.280
No.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.640
Apologize to Ms. Zhong.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.250
Ms. Zhong, please be merciful

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.630
and forgive our ignorance.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.520
Get out.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.780
Yes.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:31.760
Master Uncle.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.579
Why are you suddenly like this?

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.710
Chunji.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:40.820
Master Jiang.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.260
Chunji,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.940
I heard from other disciples

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.340
that you've moved back to Shanfeng Branch.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.630
What Master Shao means

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.100
is that Chunji can return

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.630
because she's the Branch Chief

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.870
of Shanfeng Branch.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.000
Other than her,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.950
I won't allow anyone

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.200
to sit in this seat.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.450
I see.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.180
It seems you have something

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.520
to discuss with Chunji.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.180
I'll leave you two alone then.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.800
Master.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.550
What's going on here?

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.070
It seems the news has spread.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.600
What news?

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.120
Chunji,

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.490
don't you know about

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.240
the tattoo on your body?

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.170
What tattoo?

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.490
I don't know anything about it.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.290
See for yourself.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.120
[To Master Shao]

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.240
Recently,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.720
I asked Master Shao

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.590
about the tattoo

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.800
on Miss Zhong's back.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.780
To find the Princess of Lang Ya

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.620
is a matter of great importance.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.680
I've written to inform my godfather.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.250
If someone from the palace comes,

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.329
Master Shao, don't be surprised.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.740
If you're not dead in four days,

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.200
I'll give you a great gift.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.280
A gift that will make you

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.520
truly valuable.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.530
Master Shao.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.390
Minister Tang
and General Yuchi have arrived.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.000
Invite them in.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.600
Yes.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.880
Minister Tang?

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.510
Why would a court official

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.640
go to Zhong's place?

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.090
Minister Tang.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.430
Master Shao.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.360
Is this Miss Zhong?

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.830
Miss Zhong,

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.880
please come with me
to the Empress's temporary palace,

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.860
so she can verify your identity.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.290
Go ahead.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.000
Master...

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.340
Miss Zhong.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.960
Please.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.460
Minister Tang.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.120
Miss Zhong,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.600
this way.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.720
[Central Plains Sword Alliance]

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.260
Never mind.

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.520
I'll give it to Zhong next time.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:39.440
We're here.

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:41.950
I've done all I can.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.280
Little fox, take care of yourself.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:45.950
Elder Xue Xianzi.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:47.800
What is it?

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.570
I suppose getting Shui Duopo's help

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.960
won't be easy.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.110
It's easy.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.600
She's right in there.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.650
Just go knock on her door
and ask for treatment.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:00.730
If she agrees to treat you, good.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.860
If not, we'll think of something else.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.200
It's not troublesome.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.620
If it's not troublesome,

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:08.550
why are you running away?

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.160
Who's running away?

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:10.750
I—

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:11.960
Xue Xianzi, you old devil,

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.890
what trouble have you brought now?

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:16.160
Have you changed your mind?

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.680
Are you planning to hand
little Xue Fu over to me?

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.310
Don't even think about it.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.480
Little Xue Fu staying with me

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.920
was what we agreed upon.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.270
You want to go back on your words?

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.270
Not a chance.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.680
I should never have agreed

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.920
to let Xue Fu go with you,

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.250
sightseeing every day.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.650
Have you ever cared about her?

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:30.290
Senior,

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.630
who is Xue Fu?

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:32.190
Go away.

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:33.890
Adults are talking.
Children shouldn't interrupt.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:34.820
What's it to you?

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:38.120
So this is Shui Duopo?

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:38.980
She's so young.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.200
Don't be fooled by her appearance.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.120
She's actually

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:43.919
an old granny.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.820
What's your name?

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.270
I am Tang Lici.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.960
The one recently wanted by
the Sword Alliance,

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.820
Yique Yinyang?

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.350
Yique Yinyang is already dead.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:58.880
He has nothing to do with me.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:01.680
Let me check your pulse.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.410
What kind of martial arts do you practice?

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.360
With an injury like yours,
you should be dead by now.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.690
How are you still alive?

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.510
Are you interested, Senior?

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.320
I'm not interested.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.670
Just curious.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.490
You, come here.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:41.390
Me?

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:49.790
As I thought.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.320
I see now.

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:57.870
There's no medicine for your injury.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:02.940
Indeed, there's no medicine

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.340
for my injury.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:07.230
It's understandable that you're at a loss.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.580
Who are you underestimating, youngster?

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.810
I only said there's no medicine for it,

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:14.410
not that it can't be treated.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.200
It's just that there's no medicine.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:17.840
Besides,

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.910
it would only treat the symptoms,
not the cause.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:21.500
Senior,

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.550
what do you mean?

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.610
Glowing Meteorite.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.000
That's the medicinal catalyst

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.730
to treat your friend's injury.

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:30.670
Decades ago,

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:32.080
a strange meteorite

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.550
fell onto Mount Baojing,

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.010
about three li southeast.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.290
It looks like crystal,

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.850
shimmering like a rainbow.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
It's called the Glowing Meteorite.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.240
It's found only in that one place,

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.420
but the terrain there is treacherous

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.600
and there are strange phenomena.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.630
Over these decades,

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:47.630
many have tried

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:50.230
to climb the mountain
and retrieve this stone.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.070
In the end,

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.310
they either died on the towering peaks,

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:53.790
or

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.650
simply disappeared without a trace.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:56.790
Nothing hard about that.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:57.720
With our martial arts skills,

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.950
surely we can retrieve it.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.280
I'll go get it tomorrow.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.480
I'll go with Shen.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.360
Don't think that you can
climb the mountain

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.670
just because
you have great martial skills.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:05.600
It's a hundred times more dangerous

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.770
than you can imagine.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:07.900
How dangerous is it?

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.940
I don't really want to say.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.270
Unless this old man

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.270
hands over Xue Fu.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.480
Dream on!

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:23.200
What's the relationship

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.750
between you and this Xue Fu?

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:33.920
It's not some magical treasure, is it?

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:35.790
Mr. Tang,

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:36.710
come with me.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.140
The rest of you stay here.

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:56.170
What has happened these days?

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.880
Has the Sword Alliance attacked?

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:02.710
Since you're here,

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.440
hiding away

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.570
is not the style of the Sword Alliance.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:10.910
West Palace Chief,

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:12.980
you are truly perceptive.

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:15.780
You have an extraordinary bearing,

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.080
quite different from

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.250
those of the Sword Alliance.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:20.310
May I ask your name?

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.720
Why have you appeared

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.120
at Xiuyu Peony Pavilion?

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.780
I am Dieban Chonghua,

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.020
Fang Pingzhai.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:29.870
I would like to ask you

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.600
for a small favor.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.910
So, you're the renowned

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:35.570
Chief of Fallen Shisan Tower.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.600
But

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.440
with your abilities,

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.540
what can I

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.030
possibly help you with?

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.160
I'm looking for someone.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:47.930
Unfortunately,

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.380
Peony Pavilion was empty.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.140
I could only wait here
for someone to come.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:54.670
But fortunately,

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.680
patience has paid off.

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:00.780
I chanced upon you, West Palace Chief.

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.110
Who are you looking for, Chief?

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.540
The Master of a Fengliu Shop, Liu Yan.

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:07.710
I have some business to discuss with him.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:08.800
Unfortunately,

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.370
I

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.740
also wish to know Master's whereabouts.

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.600
Don't you see that Xiuyu Peony Pavilion

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.120
is now deserted?

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:18.140
It seems that I

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:19.910
will have to capture

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.260
an important figure from Fengliu Shop

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.320
to attract

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.720
Master Liu's attention.

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:30.580
Do you know

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.820
Master Liu's whereabouts now?

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.260
Chief Fang,

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:39.200
does an assassin who betrays Shisan Tower

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:40.800
have any chance of survival?

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.760
Of course not.

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.080
Then why do you think

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.000
Fengliu Shop

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.250
would treat its people
better than Shisan Tower?

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:56.270
Such a charming young lady.

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:58.220
Would Master Liu bear to let you go?

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.600
You really know how to jest.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.140
How about this?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.750
Let me leave.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.410
Tomorrow night,

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.910
I will introduce you

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:12.340
to Master.

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:15.860
Can I trust your words?

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:20.960
Shisan Tower
has always been a place of trade.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.120
It's a business.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.400
If you set

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.030
a price buyers can't afford,

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:30.750
and since this is a marketplace,

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.100
then trust comes first.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.020
Respect for customers is second.

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:35.630
If you want to do business,

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.840
how can you offend the customer?

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:44.270
Your eloquence

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.310
truly impresses me.

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:50.510
Very well.

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:53.100
Please inform your Master

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:54.270
that I

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:56.270
await his presence.

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:29.310
You have questions for me?

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:30.670
No.

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:33.070
You want to ask

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.220
who I really am

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.950
and why I have

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:38.610
such a special constitution.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.190
So,

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:47.790
you've seen others

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:49.520
with a constitution like mine?

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:53.080
I'm a divine doctor.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.620
One touch and I knew

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.220
you're different from ordinary people.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:57.880
I come from the Tianren Realm.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:01.860
Tianren Realm?

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:07.340
What place is that?

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:08.820
Never heard of it.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:18.580
The Tianren Realm

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.750
originated from Shenzhou.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:21.580
In our clan,

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.920
everyone practiced cultivation

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.380
and achieved great merit.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.030
The leader at that time
promised us

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:29.820
eternal life.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:31.910
Using secret techniques,

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:34.370
he forcibly lifted
the entire Tianren Realm

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.740
from the ground.

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:37.280
He foolishly

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.100
sought to ascend to godhood.

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.450
But such an act against nature

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.580
caused the entire Tianren Realm

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:44.910
to disappear

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.390
into the shattered void.

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:48.340
Thousands of years later,

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.430
after experiencing
Tianren's five declines,

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:51.890
our lives hung by a thread.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:53.310
The later Gumu Kingdom

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.460
was built on the ruins

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.660
of the Tianren Realm.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:03.460
It seems

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:06.390
you truly have no interest

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:07.940
in the Tianren Realm.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.210
You want to examine me,

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:17.770
but you won't ask about my symptoms?

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.990
Of course I know your symptoms.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.109
What's with that heart crystal

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:29.280
inside your body?

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.690
In all my years of practice,

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.810
I've never seen anything so strange.

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.770
It's the heart crystal of Fang Zhou,

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:41.230
the Chief of Zhoudi Tower.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.130
Fang Zhou, the Seven‑String True Tune?

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:46.500
Why are you carrying his heart?

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.560
This heart crystal

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.030
is the key to Fang Zhou's resurrection.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:52.320
Impossible.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.430
You want to bring the dead back to life?

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:55.360
It can't be done.

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:00.430
But I particularly enjoy

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:01.830
doing what can't be done,

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:04.230
even if it means risking my life.

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.740
You're keeping this heart crystal
inside you,

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.630
nourishing it with your vital essence,

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:16.630
keeping it alive.

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.040
This heart crystal

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:19.220
is now

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.590
your most serious injury.

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:21.300
Your hair

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.870
must have changed overnight

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:25.050
as your vital essence
was critically depleted.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:25.830
If it weren't for that girl

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:26.740
outside,

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:28.670
you would be dead by now.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.180
Relying on a medicine person's blood
to survive

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.090
will only make you need more and more.

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:35.000
In the end,

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:37.370
you'll need to drain her completely.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.110
It's precisely because this injury
is troublesome

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:52.040
that I need a divine doctor's help.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.300
How long have you carried
this heart crystal for?

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.360
Nearly four years.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:59.450
Then I'll be frank.

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:00.590
This heart crystal has been

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:01.630
in your body too long.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:02.260
It has already connected

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.660
to your heart meridians.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.500
Medicine made from the Glowing Meteorite

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.100
can indeed heal your injury.

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:08.160
But afterward,

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.260
your condition will rapidly deteriorate.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.540
It'll be like drinking poison
to quench thirst.

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:13.470
Between you two,

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:15.090
only one can survive.

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:19.590
Think carefully.

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:20.930
If you want to live,

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.220
you must remove this heart crystal soon.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.910
Even for a divine doctor

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:41.950
like yourself,

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:44.040
is there truly no other way?

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.300
In this world,

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:53.200
some impossible things

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:54.610
are truly impossible.

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:55.950
Think it through.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.500
I understand.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.630
Please allow me

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.710
to think about this carefully.

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:46.780
♪ As spring wanes
in the eastern district of Pujun ♪

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:51.870
♪ The doors are shut tight ♪

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:54.260
♪ In the silent temple ♪

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:54.780
Leader.

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:00.500
Master.

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.310
You disappeared
after the fight with Puzhu.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:05.170
Where have you been all this time?

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:06.350
I was wounded

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:07.870
and trapped in a cave

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:08.980
below a cliff.

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:10.910
I only returned after recovering.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:11.910
What about Puzhu?

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:13.020
Is he dead?

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:17.710
We were both badly injured.

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:18.910
He managed to escape.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:25.910
You are

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:27.590
lying to me.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:33.600
Why would I have any reason

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:35.680
to deceive you, Master?

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:38.370
When I was returning just now,

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:39.590
I met Fang Pingzhai,

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.740
the Chief of Shisan Tower,
in the Peony Pavilion.

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:42.780
He wants to see you

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.020
and asked me

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.500
to relay the message.

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:47.510
He gave the map of Peony Pavilion

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:48.660
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.720
He should be avoiding me at all costs,

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:52.430
yet he wants to see me?

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:05.540
Xiaohong.

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:09.070
In the blink of an eye,

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.190
you killed them and devoured the bones.

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:12.990
As expected from Fengliu Shop's

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:14.350
Master Liu,

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:17.150
expert in medicine,
curse bugs, and martial arts.

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:24.110
Chief Fang,

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:25.950
do not test

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.190
my patience.

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.220
I, Fang Pingzhai...

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:33.910
Master,

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:37.300
since you've come to our meeting,

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.830
why are you leaving so soon?

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:41.590
Shisan Tower didn't show up
for the battle at Peony Pavilion,

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:42.590
which means you

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:44.200
have no sincere intention
to work together.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.330
As for these people,

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.640
they are the price for you taking the map

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.870
as that person instructed.

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:48.950
Whether Shisan Tower

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:50.190
has an undeserved reputation,

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:52.020
or you deliberately disrespect me,

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:53.020
not killing you

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:55.780
is already my mercy.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:23:59.670
Do these people represent

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:01.330
the strength of Shisan Tower?

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:05.460
I believe you have

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:06.670
misunderstood.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:09.500
Before they attacked,

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:12.210
didn't they know they were attacking

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:14.390
the world-renowned

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:15.980
Master of Fengliu Shop?

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:17.540
How could they dare to imagine

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.670
they would succeed?

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.830
I came today

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.910
to make another deal with you.

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:34.280
The techniques of the Rebirth Scroll.

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:44.430
You can't afford the price

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:45.780
for what you want.

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:46.790
Is that so?

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:48.660
If you find out

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.020
Tang Lici said the same thing,

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:53.490
would you be pleased or furious?

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:01.910
You have three final sentences.

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:03.670
So few?

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:06.150
Let me think.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.150
I know Tang Lici

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:10.410
left the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:11.490
That's one.

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:14.260
I also know

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:16.220
where he went.

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:17.870
And finally...

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:19.700
Now is your best

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:21.190
chance

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.370
to kill him.

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:32.910
Senior,

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:34.630
I used to

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:35.960
look up to you as my idol.

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.040
I can't believe you're like this.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.460
What am I like?

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:42.150
Sneaking around

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.220
and taking someone else's treasure.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:44.870
I took...

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:47.830
Yes, yes.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.150
You're making me worry all day,

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.980
being afraid you'd lose Xue Fu.

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:55.830
Better to return her
to her rightful owner,

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:57.830
so Xue Fu can have someone to rely on.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:58.630
You...

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:00.150
Yes, Senior Xue Xianzi,

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:01.950
how could you do this?

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:02.780
I...

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:09.540
Fine.

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:10.490
Shui Duopo,

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:11.390
I guess

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:13.120
you've got something on me now.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:14.120
Then promise me

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.060
you'll take good care
of the white-haired fox

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:17.590
and I'll bring Xue Fu to you.

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:18.110
Okay.

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:19.110
Bring

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:20.320
little Xue Fu back now.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.420
I miss her so much.

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.910
Fang Zhou,

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:51.910
Liu Yan was right.

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.200
I've actually lied to you.

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:56.330
You still haven't told us

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:57.430
what your name is.

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:00.740
Tang.

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:02.430
Tang?

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:04.520
And your given name?

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:09.920
Perhaps you've forgotten?

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:11.300
Who your parents are,

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.100
and why you know martial arts...

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:14.540
Have you forgotten everything?

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:15.540
Their sacrifice

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.040
made you perfect.

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:18.150
Killing

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:19.910
is your nature.

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:21.150
Is this

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:22.950
what you call kindness?

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:30.430
May I?

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:32.690
Shen, welcome.

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:41.460
What were you thinking about just now?

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:48.700
I was thinking about how to

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.700
solve the mystery of Mount Baojing.

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:52.590
You're scared, aren't you?

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:01.670
Sometimes,

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:03.500
your perceptiveness

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:05.190
is what frightens me.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:09.700
Shen,

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.910
have you ever thought about death?

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:14.410
I think about it often.

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:16.210
I'm still alive now

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:19.760
because I don't want to meet Huiniang
empty-handed.

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:24.180
But I've always believed

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:26.540
that people should do everything possible

00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:27.390
to stay alive.

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:29.740
When you're alive,

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:31.540
there are many things you can do.

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:34.390
But if you die,

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:36.960
there's nothing left.

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:40.520
There are many reasons to risk one's life.

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:41.430
For Puzhu,

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:42.710
Master Cheng,

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:43.800
and Master Shao,

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.720
it's because of responsibility and belief.

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:47.870
Chi Yun and I

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.360
do it for love and righteousness.

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:53.210
But you're different.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.040
You're quite talkative today, Shen.

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.510
It's because
you're saying too little today.

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:44.360
You've changed.

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:47.150
How so?

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.660
You're no longer afraid of Shei.

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:56.470
You use the word "afraid"...

00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:58.700
You're not afraid of anyone

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.100
because you're powerful

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:02.150
and no one is worthy of your fear.

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:05.150
But no matter
what powerful enemy you face,

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:07.880
you've never been as guarded
as you are with Shei.

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:10.730
That's because

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:12.950
I once thought she was Liu Yan's

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:14.010
undercover agent.

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:18.240
Tang Lici, you know,

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:19.830
you've never explained

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:21.030
your inner feelings.

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:23.890
When you start explaining yourself,

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:25.420
you've already lost.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:35.780
And what you lack

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:37.240
is someone like her.

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:42.430
At least she can express

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:43.890
her true feelings for you.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.610
She lives more authentically than you do.

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:56.190
You see,

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.020
this is how she is.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:00.840
She always tries to please others

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.920
and can't bear to see others
hungry or tired,

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.280
injured or suffering.

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:07.030
Her greatest ability

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:08.570
is that she can sense

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:09.770
other people's pain.

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:11.350
And she can find ways

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:12.410
to comfort others.

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:19.910
But living like that is exhausting

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:23.010
and is without a sense of self.

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:24.460
Don't presume to define

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:26.120
someone else's sense of self.

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.740
At least she finds happiness

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:30.320
in helping others.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.580
She lives more happily than you.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.430
She lives more happily than me.

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:40.830
This is self-sacrifice.

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:42.700
She's willing to.

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.020
But I'm not.

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:56.260
No one asked you.

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:00.270
Don't forget our agreement.

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.040
Liu Yan is still alive.

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:04.830
At least until he dies...

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:15.670
Rest assured, Shen.

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:18.410
I will keep my word.

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:53.570
Stone!

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:54.520
Stone!

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:56.460
Mr. Tang,

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:58.390
have you seen Stone?

00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:59.230
What's wrong?

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:00.560
I got up this morning

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:01.430
to check if he had

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:02.290
kicked off his blanket,

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:03.690
but he wasn't in his room.

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:05.330
I can't find him anywhere.

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:07.060
Stone is missing?

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:08.980
He might have gone to Mount Baojing

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:10.710
to find medicine for Foxy Tang.

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:13.300
Oh no!

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:14.450
I'll go find him.

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:15.440
I'll go too.

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:16.060
Wait.

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:17.910
The secret of Mount Baojing

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:19.240
hasn't been solved yet.

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:20.300
Chi Yun,

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:22.500
you stay here and keep watch.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.150
Shen,

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:24.740
you search nearby.

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:26.700
I'll go to Mount Baojing.

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:27.540
Mr. Tang.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:29.470
Don't worry.

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:33.190
I'll definitely bring Stone back.

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:00.190
Stone!

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:02.460
Stone!

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:07.060
Stone!

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:14.750
This is Mount Baojing.

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:17.150
It doesn't look unusual.

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:19.659
But the wind here

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:21.199
is a bit strange.

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:26.750
Stone!

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:35.060
Stone.

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:40.100
Yan?

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:41.060
I never thought

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:42.389
we'd meet again so soon.

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:45.909
Tang Lici,

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:48.260
you've shown your weakness.

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:49.620
You seem nervous.

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:51.980
What's wrong?

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:53.830
Are you wondering

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:55.350
why I came here?

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:56.889
Or are you thinking

00:34:56.949 --> 00:34:58.010
how to deal with me?

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:06.260
[Mount Baojing]

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:22.590
Infuriating.

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:26.230
This mountain path
is truly difficult to climb.

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:27.710
Master came alone to Mount Baojing

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:28.710
to find Tang Lici,

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.380
but Tang Lici is cunning as a fox.

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:34.810
And he has Shen Langhun
and Chi Yun as guards.

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:37.230
I must quickly

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.460
reunite with Master.

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:20.020
Mr. Shen is so domineering.

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:23.750
I heard Mount Baojing
has extraordinary scenery.

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:26.460
I just came here for a stroll.

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:28.180
Sir,

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:29.960
you won't allow even this?

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:31.670
I'll kill you

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.310
to weaken Liu Yan.

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:45.480
Sound Killing.

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:47.710
Gods crushed, ghosts wailing!

00:36:58.540 --> 00:36:59.960
I know you're looking for him.

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:00.710
Why else would I be

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:01.910
waiting for you here?

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:04.390
If you want this boy to live,

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:05.140
just tell me

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:07.730
where Fang Zhou's body really is.

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.100
Fang Zhou's body is extremely important.

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:13.020
Of course I used

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:14.040
a special formation

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.050
to hide it.

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:25.180
Go back to Zhoudi Tower first.

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.310
I'll prove it to you.

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:28.050
You must come back with me now.

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:29.140
Not now.

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:31.140
Is his life

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.620
more important than Fang Zhou's?

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:46.270
Master!

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:48.690
Master?

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:50.270
Tang Lici,

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:52.840
you don't deserve to be anyone's master.

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:55.660
Stone!

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:25.020
Let go.

00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:26.230
Come back with me.

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:27.290
You have no choice!

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:02.100
Enough!

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:03.040
Liu Yan,

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.650
the strong winds here are strange.

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:06.310
If we keep fighting like this,

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:08.230
we'll both fall into the abyss

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:09.310
and be obliterated.

00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:10.270
Are you afraid of falling into the abyss

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:11.530
or being obliterated?

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:12.500
I'm not afraid.

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:12.910
Hey—

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:06.430
Liu Yan,

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:09.350
I'll send you up first with the red silk.

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:10.060
Otherwise,

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:11.710
both of us

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:12.510
will die here.

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:14.360
Until I find Fang Zhou,

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:16.280
I'll go wherever you go.

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:17.950
You're truly hopeless.

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:22.610
Enough nonsense.

00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:24.270
Let's get up first, then talk!

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:29.290
Don't think you can fool me again.

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:32.950
Hey—

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:10.830
Liu Yan!

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:16.540
So,

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:18.830
this is why people disappear
when coming to Mount Baojing

00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:20.790
to find medicine.

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:30.140
You're awake?

00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:37.540
Coming all this way
to find a divine doctor,

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:39.100
only to end up like this.

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:42.500
What?

00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:46.350
Couldn't trick me out of

00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:48.350
the other half of the Rebirth Scroll,

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:49.410
so you're anxious?

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:50.820
What a pity

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.020
you've run into me again.

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:54.620
Once you meet me,

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:57.180
you can't escape.
