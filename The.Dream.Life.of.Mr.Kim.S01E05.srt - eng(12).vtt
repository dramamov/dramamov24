ASAN FACTORY
SAFETY MANAGEMENT TEAM LEADER

00:01:04.815 --> 00:01:06.066
Let it harden.

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:08.944
Then you just sweep it up.

00:01:09.528 --> 00:01:11.655
FIRST DAY AT THE ACT ASAN FACTORY

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:14.241
-And just toss it out like this.
-[quirky downbeat music playing]

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:17.452
-What?
-Easy, right? The dog food is over there.

00:01:17.536 --> 00:01:19.621
And you can just give him tap water.

00:01:19.705 --> 00:01:21.665
Apparently,
it's better because of the minerals.

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:24.418
-But--
-Poop starts to smell when it piles up.

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:26.878
So dump it out fast.

00:01:26.962 --> 00:01:28.338
Why should I--

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:30.424
After 6 p.m.,
the security guard will take over.

00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:32.926
But during work hours,

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.595
remember that this is our job.

00:01:34.678 --> 00:01:36.096
Hang on a minute.

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.516
Why would the Safety and Health Manager
have to do something like this?

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.476
If you step in poop, you could slip.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.396
And slipping is dangerous.
It's a safety concern.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.357
If you don't pick up after him,
it'll smell.

00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:50.193
The smell attracts bugs.
And that's a health concern.

-Sorry?
-Do you smoke?

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:01.705
All you've shown me
is how to unclog a toilet

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:04.291
and how to clean up dog poop.

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:05.250
Is that it?

00:02:05.334 --> 00:02:06.335
Come with me.

00:02:07.586 --> 00:02:08.795

I'll only explain once.

00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:23.268

Put a circle here, here, and here.

00:02:32.653 --> 00:02:35.947
Throw in a triangle or two
from time to time.

00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:39.284
Then switch back to circles.

00:02:39.368 --> 00:02:43.163
And at the end of the month,
you take a picture of all of these

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:44.873
-and make a PDF.
-A PDF.

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:46.625
[team leader]
Then send it to headquarters.

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:47.834
-Okay.
-But

00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:50.253
no one really reads it. [chuckles]

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:55.342
One more thing. A delivery truck
needs to leave here at noon.

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:56.426
Okay.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.513
Check if they loaded up the truck properly
so nothing falls off.

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:01.139
I'm sure they will.

00:03:01.223 --> 00:03:04.101
Still, give the securing strap
a little shake like this.

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.228
And if it's loaded perfectly,

00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:09.523
simply sign whatever
the logistics guy gives you.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.777
And before the shift starts,
we do safety exercises.

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:17.614
You'll need to demonstrate
the exercises in front of people.

00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:20.826
-Me?
-Yes, you.

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.705
It's tough for introverts.
It wasn't easy for me, either.

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:27.541
I think we've covered everything.

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:29.751
So, do you smoke or not?

00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:30.711
Um…

00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:34.464
But come on.
More than a hundred people work here.

00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:36.633
Don't we need proper safety management?

00:03:37.551 --> 00:03:40.345
Do you have a license?
For industrial safety?

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:42.097
-No.
-Exactly.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.890
You and I are the same.

00:03:43.974 --> 00:03:45.767

I'll just go say bye to the dog,

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:53.233
lay low somewhere, and clock out.

00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:50.249
I said I didn't get any soup yesterday.
The seaweed soup.

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:54.211
How does not having soup yesterday

00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:58.174
justify taking another yogurt today?

00:20:59.508 --> 00:21:00.926
[Nak-su] She's got a point.

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:02.470
[sighs, inhales sharply]

00:21:02.553 --> 00:21:03.596
You see…

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:08.058
I'm from the Sales Team at headquarters.

00:21:08.142 --> 00:21:09.101
And?

00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:10.394
What?

00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:12.813
[laughs] What am I supposed to do
with that information?

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:17.401
Did headquarters tell you
to take two yogurts?

00:21:18.152 --> 00:21:19.236
[scoffs]

00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:21.363
What's with this attitude?

00:21:21.447 --> 00:21:23.157
-You're just a kid.
-What's going on?

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.242
Is this guy giving you a hard time?

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:26.202
"This guy"?

00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:28.412
I don't know.
He said he's from headquarters,

00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:29.830
so he wants an extra yogurt.

00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:32.750
-What?
-When did I say that I could have two

00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:34.627
because I'm from headquar--

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.295
Which team are you in?

00:21:36.378 --> 00:21:38.005
I'm the Safety Management team leader.

00:21:38.088 --> 00:21:41.509
I demonstrated the safety exercise
this morning, remember?

00:21:41.592 --> 00:21:42.968
Which team at HQ are you from?

00:21:43.052 --> 00:21:45.554
-What's going on?
-[worker 1] This morning…

00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:47.097
Why are you giving me

00:21:47.181 --> 00:21:49.725
such a hard time over an extra yogurt?

00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:51.894
-[worker 2] Maybe he's constipated.
-[workers laugh]

00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:54.188
[worker 3] He probably got two
at headquarters.

00:21:54.271 --> 00:21:56.482
-Just let him have another one.
-[worker 4] Whatever.

00:21:56.565 --> 00:22:00.319
-[worker 5] Let him have it.
-Gosh, you people have no manners at all!

00:22:00.402 --> 00:22:05.157
I've worked at ACT for 25 years.
That's 25 years!

00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:07.785
I shouldn't be humiliated

00:22:07.868 --> 00:22:10.120
for having an extra yogurt!
This is absurd.

00:22:10.204 --> 00:22:12.039
[worker 6] Let him have it!

00:22:12.122 --> 00:22:14.500
-[worker 7] Let him!
-[worker 8] Give it to him!

00:22:14.583 --> 00:22:17.336

-How ridiculous. I won't have it.

My goodness. Forget it.

[indistinct chatter]

00:22:32.643 --> 00:22:35.396
-[worker 9] I was just…
-[worker 10] It's one per person.

00:22:35.479 --> 00:22:37.356
[worker 11] I guess they get two
at headquarters.

[Song-hee] Sorry,
but where did you leave the cabinet key?

00:23:29.658 --> 00:23:32.036
It's under the orchid pot by the window.

00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:32.995
[Song-hee] Thank you.

He should have told us before he left.

Took us forever to find this!

00:23:43.631 --> 00:23:45.424
[Song-hee] Why the heck
did he leave it there?

00:23:45.507 --> 00:23:47.176
[Sung-gu] What's that, Mr. Do?

00:23:47.259 --> 00:23:49.053

We used to waste three days a week

One, two, three, four, five…

00:38:53.748 --> 00:38:56.251
[machines whirring]

00:38:59.212 --> 00:39:01.297
Don't you have any earplugs?

00:39:01.381 --> 00:39:04.342
-What?
-[Nak-su] Don't you have these?

00:39:04.425 --> 00:39:06.219
[in Vietnamese]
You could lose your hearing.

00:39:06.302 --> 00:39:08.555
-So make sure you wear earplugs.
-[worker] Oh!

00:39:09.639 --> 00:39:11.391
-Thank you.
-No problem.

00:39:16.104 --> 00:39:18.439
[in Korean] Have some ice cream
and cool off, everyone.

00:39:18.523 --> 00:39:19.607
Come on over.

00:39:20.358 --> 00:39:21.943
[worker 1] Snack time!

00:39:22.026 --> 00:39:23.444
[workers cheering]

00:39:23.528 --> 00:39:24.988
[worker 2] I was roasting in there.

00:39:25.071 --> 00:39:26.322
Thank you.

00:39:26.406 --> 00:39:28.324

-[laughs]

00:39:28.408 --> 00:39:31.619
[cheerful chatter]

00:39:33.746 --> 00:39:36.332
-[quirky music playing]
-[worker 3] Thanks for the ice cream!

00:39:36.416 --> 00:39:37.709
[workers] Thank you!

00:39:37.792 --> 00:39:41.504
[excited overlapping chatter]

00:39:43.756 --> 00:39:44.799
Come and get it.

00:39:45.383 --> 00:39:46.259
[worker 4] Thank you.

00:39:46.342 --> 00:39:48.928
-[worker 5] It's so sweet.
-[Ju-young] Who else wants ice cream?

00:39:49.012 --> 00:39:50.263
Here.

00:39:51.389 --> 00:39:53.516
[indistinct chatter]

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:56.269
[quirky music continues]

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:02.817
[alarm buzzes]

00:40:07.238 --> 00:40:10.199
[Ju-young] The outer diameter is off.
Just reduce it a little bit.

00:40:10.283 --> 00:40:11.910
-Then--
-Not the extruder's temperature.

00:40:11.993 --> 00:40:13.745
Make a fine adjustment to the mold.

00:40:13.828 --> 00:40:15.163
-[worker 1] Okay.
-[Ju-young] Good.

00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:16.915
It's okay. I'll finish up here.

00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:19.500
[worker 2]
We just need to check on the pump line.

00:40:19.584 --> 00:40:20.752
[Ju-young] Okay. Go on.

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:26.466
[Nak-su clears throat]

00:40:27.216 --> 00:40:28.509
[music concludes]

00:40:30.386 --> 00:40:33.014
It's time to go home.
Aren't you going home, Ms. Lee?

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.099
Sorry, what was that?

00:40:35.183 --> 00:40:37.435
Ah… [clears throat]

00:40:38.853 --> 00:40:40.438
Do you have any plans for tonight?

00:40:40.521 --> 00:40:42.148
Are you working overtime?

00:40:42.231 --> 00:40:44.442
[sighs] I wish.

00:40:44.525 --> 00:40:46.819
Overtime and extra shifts are on hold.

00:40:46.903 --> 00:40:48.446
-[clears throat]
-Why do you ask?

00:40:48.529 --> 00:40:49.530
Uh…

00:40:50.156 --> 00:40:51.950
If you're free,
would you like to have dinner?

00:40:52.033 --> 00:40:53.534
Or drinks, if you'd prefer.

00:40:53.618 --> 00:40:57.080
I feel like we haven't talked much.
I mean, ever.

00:40:57.163 --> 00:40:58.539
Just the two of us?

00:40:58.623 --> 00:41:00.500
Yes, why not? [chuckles nervously]

00:41:00.583 --> 00:41:02.543
It's my treat.

00:41:02.627 --> 00:41:04.253
What do you like, Ms. Lee?

00:41:04.337 --> 00:41:07.507
Oh! I noticed a place
down the road from here

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:10.426
that serves pork belly
grilled in an earthenware jar.

00:41:12.679 --> 00:41:15.223
If we're having pork belly,
why don't we just eat it here?

00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:17.558
We've got a grill, tongs, and everything.

00:41:17.642 --> 00:41:18.518
Here?

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:22.647
-I mean…
-[worker] Ju-young!

00:41:23.189 --> 00:41:24.440
Could you come here?

00:41:24.524 --> 00:41:25.566
Okay!

00:41:26.901 --> 00:41:29.404
Come to the Safety Management
Team office at 7:00.

00:41:29.487 --> 00:41:31.197
I'll have everything ready.

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.824
Okay then. [chuckles nervously]

00:41:32.907 --> 00:41:34.659
-I'll see you later.
-[Nak-su] See you.

00:41:35.535 --> 00:41:37.537
[mutters] What's wrong with eating out?

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:39.330
-[Ju-young] I almost forgot.
-What?

00:41:40.039 --> 00:41:41.916
We have everything but meat.

00:41:42.542 --> 00:41:44.210
Oh, the meat. [chuckles]

00:41:44.752 --> 00:41:46.671
Can't meet without some meat. [chuckles]

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:48.423
Here. Pork neck for me.

00:41:49.048 --> 00:41:50.383
-See you later.
-[Nak-su] See you.

00:41:50.466 --> 00:41:51.551
[Ju-young] I'm coming!

00:41:51.634 --> 00:41:53.970
[quirky downbeat music playing]

STARTUP EXCESSES

00:41:58.182 --> 00:42:01.019
This company's biggest issue
is that we have endless meetings,

00:42:01.102 --> 00:42:04.063
but they rarely lead to
any productive outcomes.

00:42:04.147 --> 00:42:07.108
-Most of them just end at the idea stage.
-[Han-na and Jeong-hwan whispering]

00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:08.359
[Han-na and Jeong-hwan giggle]

00:42:08.443 --> 00:42:09.861
-It was you, right?
-No.

00:42:09.944 --> 00:42:12.405
-Come on. [laughs]
-[Han-na] Focus.

00:42:12.488 --> 00:42:13.948
-[cell phone buzzes]
-[Su-gyeom] Also,

00:42:14.032 --> 00:42:15.908
the culture of frequent partying

00:42:15.992 --> 00:42:18.745
-has done us more harm than--
-[cell phone buzzing]

00:42:18.828 --> 00:42:20.663
[Jeong-hwan in English] Hey, JJ.
What's up, man?

00:42:20.747 --> 00:42:22.957
-[Ethan in Korean] It's JJ.
-[in English] You're in Korea?

00:42:23.041 --> 00:42:25.251
-[Han-na] What?
-[breathes deeply]

00:42:25.334 --> 00:42:27.253
[in Korean] It lowers productivity,

00:42:27.336 --> 00:42:30.131
-and the company's direction--
-Su-gyeom, I'm so sorry. One second.

00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:31.299
Who's free tonight?

00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:34.093
It's DJ Kloud's listening party,
and he said he can get us good seats.

00:42:34.177 --> 00:42:35.553
Oh, me!

00:42:35.636 --> 00:42:37.013
-[Jack] Me!
-[Ethan] Sounds fire.

00:42:37.096 --> 00:42:38.681
[Jeong-hwan in English]
Yeah, five people.

00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:41.517
-[in Korean] What about Su-gyeom?
-Hmm?

00:42:43.186 --> 00:42:45.980
Our CDO's probably
sick of parties for a while.

00:42:46.064 --> 00:42:47.482
[Ethan laughs]

00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:50.860
-What does that mean?
-It doesn't mean anything.

00:42:50.943 --> 00:42:52.862
-[Jack snickers]
-You hate parties.

00:42:53.863 --> 00:42:56.240
That's why you're giving
this presentation, isn't it?

00:42:56.324 --> 00:42:58.659
-That's not what you meant.
-[in English] Sorry. Yeah.

00:42:58.743 --> 00:43:00.745
-See you.
-[cell phone beeps]

00:43:00.828 --> 00:43:02.789
[Jack in Korean] This should be fun.

-[Han-na clears throat]
-[pensive music playing]

00:43:05.958 --> 00:43:08.169
I'm really sorry. Can you continue?

Our Chief Destruction Officer.

00:43:09.754 --> 00:43:10.671
[group laughs]

00:43:10.755 --> 00:43:12.548
[Han-na whispering] What's your problem?

00:43:12.632 --> 00:43:14.300
[Jeong-hwan laughing]

00:43:15.468 --> 00:43:16.344
What are you doing?

00:43:18.054 --> 00:43:19.388
-What?
-[remote clatters]

00:43:19.472 --> 00:43:20.431
[Ethan gasps]

[scoffs]

00:43:24.811 --> 00:43:25.812
I can't do this anymore!

00:43:29.774 --> 00:43:31.526
[tense music playing]

00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:32.735
[Jack] What's with him?

00:43:32.819 --> 00:43:34.237
[group exclaiming confusedly]

00:43:34.904 --> 00:43:35.988
[music fades]

[hesitates]

00:43:39.992 --> 00:43:40.952
[Ethan] Oh.

00:43:53.047 --> 00:43:54.298
[Han-na shrieks]

00:43:54.382 --> 00:43:56.092
[pensive music playing]

00:44:04.392 --> 00:44:05.810
-So you're quitting?
-Yes!

00:44:07.019 --> 00:44:08.646
This isn't the right way to resign.

00:44:08.729 --> 00:44:10.189
You're the biggest problem.

00:44:10.273 --> 00:44:12.150
-And you, you, you, all of you!
-[Jack] Me?

00:44:12.233 --> 00:44:13.651
What the heck are you doing here?

00:44:13.734 --> 00:44:15.278
Aren't we going to work?

00:44:15.361 --> 00:44:18.698
What exactly do you mean by "work"?
Be specific.

00:44:18.781 --> 00:44:21.534
Don't order me around.
You've never been specific about anything.

00:44:21.617 --> 00:44:23.786
That's because I'm the one
who sets the direction.

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:25.955
Cut the crap, you prick.

00:44:26.038 --> 00:44:27.957
I'm done putting up with your nonsense.

00:44:28.583 --> 00:44:30.710
I'll just keep living my life,

00:44:31.252 --> 00:44:32.962
true to myself,

00:44:34.046 --> 00:44:35.006
and my Korean roots.

00:44:36.674 --> 00:44:38.092
Don't look down on that, punks!

00:44:38.759 --> 00:44:40.219
There's greatness in it.

00:44:40.303 --> 00:44:41.554
-Okay, that greatness--
-Shut up!

00:44:42.471 --> 00:44:43.472
[in English] Yes, sir.

00:44:46.809 --> 00:44:48.060
[music fades]

00:44:48.144 --> 00:44:51.105
-[sizzling]
-[Nak-su and Ju-young exclaiming]

00:44:53.524 --> 00:44:54.650
[Nak-su] Oh!

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:02.742
[in Korean] It's ready, right?

00:45:03.326 --> 00:45:05.494
Shall we dig in?

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:07.038
Oh.

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:13.336
[yelps]

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:15.046
Mm!

00:45:16.881 --> 00:45:18.424
[Ju-young] Go on then.

00:45:18.925 --> 00:45:19.800
[Nak-su] Sorry?

00:45:19.884 --> 00:45:22.053
Wasn't there something you wanted to say?

00:45:23.846 --> 00:45:25.556
Ah… [clears throat]

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:30.311
Well…

00:45:31.854 --> 00:45:33.564
What's the secret to your leadership?

00:45:33.648 --> 00:45:34.732
What?

00:45:34.815 --> 00:45:38.444
I was also a team leader
at headquarters for a long time,

00:45:38.527 --> 00:45:41.405
but you know how subordinates
are never on the same page.

00:45:41.489 --> 00:45:43.491
They only look out for themselves.

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.785
You know what I mean, right?

00:45:45.868 --> 00:45:46.786
I'm not so sure.

00:45:46.869 --> 00:45:50.831
I've noticed that people here
really seem to look up to you.

00:45:51.582 --> 00:45:52.500
You think?

00:45:52.583 --> 00:45:54.710
Tell me. What's your secret?

00:45:54.794 --> 00:45:56.712
Do you just shower them with praise?

00:45:56.796 --> 00:45:59.131
And then discipline them
if they're out of line?

00:45:59.757 --> 00:46:01.342
-Excuse me?
-I mean…

00:46:02.927 --> 00:46:07.223
I was wondering if you have
your own management philosophy.

00:46:10.393 --> 00:46:11.310
And if I do?

00:46:11.394 --> 00:46:12.687
[quirky music playing]

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:16.357
I was wondering if I could get
a quick tip from you.

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.900
Ah… A quick tip?

00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:20.152
[Ju-young breathing deeply]

00:46:20.236 --> 00:46:21.320
Hmm…

00:46:25.032 --> 00:46:27.702
[inhales sharply, clicks tongue]
First of all… [sighs]

00:46:29.412 --> 00:46:31.622
…once or twice a month,

00:46:31.706 --> 00:46:34.625
I run a book club with the staff.

00:46:36.043 --> 00:46:37.878
A book club…

00:46:38.421 --> 00:46:41.882
Like for Dale Carnegie's
How to Win Friends and Influence People?

00:46:42.717 --> 00:46:43.759
-Yes.
-Ah…

00:46:44.468 --> 00:46:45.845
And every quarter, um,

00:46:46.846 --> 00:46:48.347
we put on a play.

00:46:48.431 --> 00:46:50.766
-A play?
-Group meditation too.

00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:53.561
I see. Group meditation.

00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:02.236
-You're lying, aren't you?
-[spits, laughs]

00:47:02.778 --> 00:47:04.238
[laughs]

[laughs]

00:47:06.949 --> 00:47:08.075
Yes, I do.

-Jeez.
-[music fades]

00:47:10.328 --> 00:47:12.538
We don't have time for any of that crap.

00:47:13.289 --> 00:47:16.292
We're all exhausted.
We just want to get wasted and pass out.

00:47:19.503 --> 00:47:22.631
I'm your senior, and I'm trying to learn.

00:47:22.715 --> 00:47:23.841
The least you could do

00:47:23.924 --> 00:47:26.719
is make an effort to answer
when I ask something.

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:29.638
-What would you use my advice for?
-What do you think?

00:47:29.722 --> 00:47:33.100
I was going to use it once I became
an executive at headquarters.

00:47:33.934 --> 00:47:35.436
You're going back to headquarters?

00:47:35.519 --> 00:47:36.896
Of course.

00:47:36.979 --> 00:47:39.440
Why? You don't think I can?

00:47:40.524 --> 00:47:41.609
No, I don't.

00:47:46.614 --> 00:47:47.656
[clicks tongue]

00:47:48.449 --> 00:47:51.077
Don't you know what kind
of position you have now?

00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:54.497
Under the Serious Accidents
Punishment Act,

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:57.792
workplaces with 100 or more employees
are required to have a safety manager.

00:47:57.875 --> 00:48:00.586
But it doesn't matter who it is.
They just need to fill the spot.

-That's where you are, Mr. Kim.
-[pensive music playing]

00:48:09.845 --> 00:48:12.306
I'm sorry if that sounded harsh,

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:16.102
but we're the ones who take the hit
whenever they send non-experts here.

00:48:16.185 --> 00:48:17.520
You see this?

00:48:17.603 --> 00:48:20.064
I got injured last year
while loading cargo.

00:48:33.911 --> 00:48:34.787
[Nak-su sighs]

00:48:38.791 --> 00:48:41.335
Then what should I do? Tell me.

00:48:42.253 --> 00:48:44.839
I've been working for 25 years,
and this is the first time

00:48:44.922 --> 00:48:47.466
I've spent an entire day
at work doing nothing.

00:48:48.175 --> 00:48:49.051
Okay?

00:48:50.302 --> 00:48:53.222
I don't want to just sit around.
I want to work.

00:48:53.305 --> 00:48:56.559
So tell me what to do.
I really don't know. Please?

00:48:56.642 --> 00:48:59.979
I'm not talking about picking up dog poop
or those pointless safety exercises.

00:49:00.062 --> 00:49:01.480
I mean real work!

00:49:01.564 --> 00:49:02.857
There is no such thing.

00:49:03.858 --> 00:49:07.528
You don't need to learn anything,
and we don't need your help either.

00:49:07.611 --> 00:49:11.115
Just keep a low profile

00:49:11.949 --> 00:49:14.201
and leave whenever you want.
That's all you have to do.

00:49:15.202 --> 00:49:16.579
-Come on.
-[Ju-young] Oh.

00:49:17.371 --> 00:49:18.456
There is one thing.

00:49:18.956 --> 00:49:20.458
Since it's summer,

00:49:21.542 --> 00:49:23.836
please make sure to change
the dog's water more frequently.

00:49:23.919 --> 00:49:25.296
It's summer, after all.

This is a demotion, an exile,

to make me quit on my own.

to get his contact information.

00:57:15.432 --> 00:57:16.934
I'll text it to you.

00:57:18.018 --> 00:57:20.562
By the way,
how did you find out about this?

00:57:20.646 --> 00:57:23.482
LESS DOUBT, MORE DETERMINATION

00:57:23.565 --> 00:57:26.193

[ethereal choral music playing]

00:58:06.233 --> 00:58:08.068
[worker 3] Go around! No!

DECEMBER 16, 2008

00:58:25.168 --> 00:58:26.753
[Gang-hun] After 182 days in this hell,

00:58:26.837 --> 00:58:31.091
[Gang-hun] I'm finally returning
to headquarters.

00:58:31.925 --> 00:58:34.761
Don't you lose hope.

00:58:35.345 --> 00:58:38.056
It's your turn now.

00:58:38.557 --> 00:58:40.809
[tense music continues]

00:58:44.396 --> 00:58:46.148
I'm not running for food.

[panting]

00:58:47.315 --> 00:58:50.068
[Nak-su]
And it's not to beat this girl either.

00:58:50.152 --> 00:58:52.863
I'm running to prove
that this punishment was wrong.

00:58:52.946 --> 00:58:54.031
So that I, Kim Nak-su,

00:58:54.114 --> 00:58:56.700
can return as General Manager Kim
of ACT Group.

00:58:57.617 --> 00:59:00.662
That's why I'm running.

Enjoy your meal.

00:59:26.146 --> 00:59:27.105
Oh…

00:59:27.189 --> 00:59:30.067
And you can wash the water bowl

00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:32.069
if you adore the dog that much.

00:59:32.152 --> 00:59:33.487
[scoffs]

00:59:35.906 --> 00:59:38.450
I'm going back. No matter what.

[Jae-hyeok] Let's bring
Kim Nak-su back to HQ, sir.

01:01:31.938 --> 01:01:34.399
The only person
I can ask for help with this

01:01:35.317 --> 01:01:36.443
is you, sir.

01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:39.029
-Sung-gu!
-Mr. Kim!

01:01:39.112 --> 01:01:41.198
[Jin-woo] Still,
you should treat him well.

01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:42.866
You might end up working for him again.

01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:45.243
Your humble subordinate, Kim Nak-su,
is here to greet you.

01:01:45.327 --> 01:01:46.328
[laughs]

01:01:46.411 --> 01:01:49.456
[Sung-gu] You don't have anyone else
to count on in the Sales Team, anyway.

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:50.999
Shouldn't you put in more effort

01:01:51.082 --> 01:01:53.460
at times like this to secure your career?

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:56.254
[Jae-hyeok] The Asan factory
is the HR Team's biggest battle this year.

01:01:56.338 --> 01:01:59.591
Sir. We need your help.

01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:01.718
[Nak-su] Ha-jin, I'm sorry.

01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:03.553
I really messed up.
