Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:19.084
Then what should I do?

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.399
Should I just break up with him?

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:21.185
Don't you dare.

00:00:21.185 --> 00:00:22.229
What reason will you even use?

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.120
Just keep playing the island boyfriend.

00:00:24.317 --> 00:00:25.661
We'll see what happens next.

00:00:26.098 --> 00:00:28.111
Shit! Who did this?!

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:29.906
Come out and talk now, Peng!

00:00:29.906 --> 00:00:30.924
It'd be awful, right?

00:00:30.924 --> 00:00:33.481
Loving each other that much but not being able to stay together.

00:00:33.722 --> 00:00:34.753
How are you feeling these days?

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.435
I feel uncomfortable having to lie to him.

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:37.600
Who'd believe it, right?

00:00:37.775 --> 00:00:39.269
My boyfriend is a prince.

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:40.755
How long have you known about this?

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.509
Losing my memory hurt enough,

00:00:43.165 --> 00:00:44.695
but now this hurts even more.

00:00:53.723 --> 00:00:54.748
Here's your meal.

00:00:55.164 --> 00:00:56.140
Please enjoy it, Your Highness.

00:00:57.036 --> 00:00:58.223
What language are you speaking?

00:00:59.054 --> 00:01:01.351
Well, you're a prince.

00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:03.776
I have to use royal language. That's correct.

00:01:07.806 --> 00:01:10.470
Aren't you two going to eat with me?

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:14.449
Oh, Uncle Peng and I will eat
at another table.

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:19.027
Then I won't eat.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.389
This food isn't good enough for me.

00:01:23.898 --> 00:01:25.984
Also, take me to Aomsin's house.

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.680
He has an exam today.

00:01:28.023 --> 00:01:30.509
But I think you don't need to go.

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.876
Aomsin can handle it.

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:33.860
But I want to go.

00:01:34.538 --> 00:01:36.192
I want to cheer her on.

00:01:37.592 --> 00:01:39.418
If you want to treat me like a prince,

00:01:40.074 --> 00:01:41.772
you must do everything I say.

00:01:42.188 --> 00:01:43.186
Don't argue.

00:01:45.908 --> 00:01:46.408
But—

00:01:46.408 --> 00:01:46.921
No “but.”

00:01:47.905 --> 00:01:49.988
My orders are final.

00:01:50.447 --> 00:01:51.190
Do you understand?

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:07.228
What should I do, Uncle?

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.276
He looks really mad.

00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:11.076
Give him some time

00:02:11.776 --> 00:02:12.582
The information is new to him.

00:02:12.582 --> 00:02:13.404
He might still be in shock.

00:02:14.126 --> 00:02:15.242
Just stay calm.

00:02:16.161 --> 00:02:17.892
His family will come
to pick him up soon anyway.

00:02:23.096 --> 00:02:23.596
Ouch!

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.277
Hey!

00:02:27.673 --> 00:02:28.534
Uncle!

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:28.953
A knife cut like this is nothing.

00:03:28.953 --> 00:03:30.394
It's miles away from your heart.

00:03:30.744 --> 00:03:33.909
You can treat this kind of wound
yourself at home.

00:03:34.062 --> 00:03:36.594
Oh, the knife is old.

00:03:36.594 --> 00:03:37.576
I was worried it might have germs,

00:03:37.795 --> 00:03:39.085
so I came to get it checked.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.286
Should I unwrap it
and redo the wound dressing?

00:03:46.767 --> 00:03:51.169
I guess you just want someone else
to treat your wound.

00:03:54.775 --> 00:03:56.959
Doctor Wut, emergency patient here!

00:04:06.277 --> 00:04:09.373
You didn't purposely cut yourself
just to come see me, did you?

00:04:10.948 --> 00:04:12.493
And what if I say I did?

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.673
Why would you go that far?

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.369
You're hurting yourself for nothing.

00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:22.059
I'm kidding. It was really an accident.

00:04:32.322 --> 00:04:33.761
Hey, stop that.

00:04:34.942 --> 00:04:36.542
This is a government building.

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:37.332
Don't.

00:04:37.551 --> 00:04:38.929
Stay still.

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:42.274
Let me hug you for a bit longer.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.598
If I were the village head,

00:04:46.598 --> 00:04:49.409
I wouldn't have to fake a bleeding wound
to come see you like this.

00:04:53.696 --> 00:04:55.059
You're going to be.

00:04:55.912 --> 00:04:57.286
Your speech was so inspiring.

00:04:57.833 --> 00:04:58.900
Inspiring?

00:04:59.381 --> 00:05:01.285
If it weren't for Wave and Lava helping me,

00:05:01.897 --> 00:05:03.654
I would've been done for a long time ago.

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:08.814
Hey, give yourself some credit.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:10.435
You built all of this.

00:05:12.097 --> 00:05:12.819
Do you understand?

00:05:15.662 --> 00:05:17.895
You can do it. You're really capable.

00:05:29.065 --> 00:05:32.178
Doctor, Wave is a prince.

00:05:32.615 --> 00:05:33.347
What?

00:05:35.818 --> 00:05:38.309
You can do it. Don't worry.

00:05:38.484 --> 00:05:39.449
You've practiced so much already.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.860
I'm not so confident, Teacher Wave.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.597
I'm afraid I'll make a mistake.

00:05:45.062 --> 00:05:47.174
It's okay even if you do.

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:48.843
You don't have to be the best.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.525
At least you'll learn something,

00:05:51.897 --> 00:05:54.346
and everyone will see your talent.

00:05:55.833 --> 00:05:59.202
I'm sure you'll get the scholarship
and become a world-class musician.

00:05:59.902 --> 00:06:00.949
Thank you, Teacher Wave.

00:06:01.102 --> 00:06:02.674
I won't let you down.

00:06:05.474 --> 00:06:08.154
Lava, what are you standing there for?

00:06:08.154 --> 00:06:09.323
Come hug me too.

00:06:09.782 --> 00:06:11.454
I need all the encouragement I can get.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.045
Hurry up!

00:06:18.732 --> 00:06:20.368
Come on, hurry!

00:06:26.885 --> 00:06:30.000
Dad, come here!

00:06:34.216 --> 00:06:35.315
Good luck, Aomsin.

00:06:35.315 --> 00:06:35.826
Thanks.

00:06:53.637 --> 00:06:54.388
Eh?

00:06:55.705 --> 00:06:57.236
Hey, why did it stop?

00:06:59.292 --> 00:07:02.528
Come on, don't break down now.
Just get us home first.

00:07:06.224 --> 00:07:07.391
What's wrong with it?

00:07:08.911 --> 00:07:12.097
Maybe you should check
what's wrong with it first.

00:07:18.418 --> 00:07:19.266
Do you know how to fix it?

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:28.959
Hello, Tum?

00:07:29.571 --> 00:07:32.764
My motorbike broke down
near the rubber plantation entrance.

00:07:32.764 --> 00:07:33.642
Come pick me up.

00:07:35.742 --> 00:07:36.994
You'll be back late?

00:07:40.996 --> 00:07:42.545
Alright, I'll try to get a ride.

00:07:48.997 --> 00:07:52.000
I'm sorry, Your Highness,
for putting you in trouble.

00:07:52.787 --> 00:07:55.548
It's fine. It's not that bad.

00:07:56.751 --> 00:07:57.989
I could even walk back.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.631
In this heat, Your Highness?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.161
Are you sure you can walk?

00:08:01.161 --> 00:08:02.320
Maybe we should just call for a ride.

00:08:02.539 --> 00:08:03.936
I can walk.

00:08:04.308 --> 00:08:05.850
If you want to wait, then wait by yourself.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.497
Your Highness.

00:08:11.472 --> 00:08:12.304
Man, what kind of prince is this?

00:08:12.304 --> 00:08:13.202
He's so stubborn.

00:08:16.701 --> 00:08:24.172
♪ Often, the heart just walks away
without looking where it's going ♪

00:08:24.566 --> 00:08:26.858
Whoa, it's so hot.

00:08:26.989 --> 00:08:28.215
Can you really walk in this heat?

00:08:33.858 --> 00:08:35.027
He's just unbelievable.

00:08:35.552 --> 00:08:40.621
♪ Standing under the sky
doesn't feel the same ♪

00:08:40.621 --> 00:08:46.259
♪ Summer isn't the same without you ♪

00:08:47.331 --> 00:08:49.516
Ugh, it's boiling!

00:09:08.045 --> 00:09:09.162
You're sweating a lot.

00:09:09.556 --> 00:09:11.135
Here, Your Highness, use my handkerchief.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.489
This cloth sure is versatile.

00:09:14.255 --> 00:09:17.064
It could wipe your blood and my sweat too.

00:09:21.952 --> 00:09:25.273
I forgot it touched my foot before.

00:09:26.039 --> 00:09:27.346
I'll just take off my shirt instead.

00:09:27.346 --> 00:09:28.088
No need.

00:09:30.136 --> 00:09:31.124
Just give me the handkerchief.

00:09:41.693 --> 00:09:44.923
The way you cheered for Aomsin
was really great.

00:09:45.032 --> 00:09:46.656
I'm sure he'll pass.

00:09:49.849 --> 00:09:51.565
I just wanted to do my duty properly

00:09:53.402 --> 00:09:54.819
to help Aomsin reach his goal.

00:09:56.241 --> 00:09:59.047
When I care about someone, I give my all.

00:10:01.014 --> 00:10:01.941
I don't fake it.

00:10:30.254 --> 00:10:32.641
Hey, the car's here,Your Highness!

00:10:35.528 --> 00:10:36.312
Let's go!

00:10:37.974 --> 00:10:38.725
Hey, bro!

00:10:39.687 --> 00:10:41.063
Stop please!

00:10:42.988 --> 00:10:44.514
Stop please!

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.215
Bro, can I hitch a ride to the guesthouse “Like Heaven,” please?

00:10:51.346 --> 00:10:54.231
Sure, kid, but you'll have to squeeze
in the back with the coconuts.

00:10:55.171 --> 00:10:55.970
No problem.

00:10:57.064 --> 00:10:57.937
Is that okay, Your Highness?

00:10:58.419 --> 00:10:59.986
What about your motorbike?

00:11:00.598 --> 00:11:01.413
I'll come back for it later.

00:11:02.791 --> 00:11:03.611
Thank you so much.

00:11:03.611 --> 00:11:04.379
Hop in.

00:11:17.716 --> 00:11:18.782
Come, let me help you.

00:11:24.807 --> 00:11:26.675
One, two, three.

00:11:35.074 --> 00:11:36.115
Let's go, bro!

00:11:54.135 --> 00:11:55.467
I'm sorry, Your Highness,

00:11:56.298 --> 00:11:57.190
for all this trouble.

00:11:57.977 --> 00:12:00.873
Please bear with it. We'll be there soon.

00:12:01.857 --> 00:12:03.473
You keep apologizing

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:04.803
and saying “Your Highness.”

00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:07.418
Can you just treat me like before?

00:12:08.665 --> 00:12:11.579
I told you, I'm still Wave.

00:12:12.541 --> 00:12:13.056
Just Wave.

00:12:14.193 --> 00:12:14.723
Wave.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.558
I understand,

00:12:19.667 --> 00:12:21.802
but you have to understand me too.

00:12:21.999 --> 00:12:23.328
I don't know how to act around you.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.944
The person I used to call my boyfriend

00:12:25.944 --> 00:12:29.016
suddenly became someone
I can't even touch now.

00:12:34.681 --> 00:12:35.777
Why can't you?

00:12:37.614 --> 00:12:42.898
I'm still the same Wave, your boyfriend.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:54.940
I want you to touch me,

00:12:56.503 --> 00:12:57.320
tease me,

00:12:58.917 --> 00:12:59.884
and make me laugh.

00:13:02.027 --> 00:13:03.100
I don't want to be a prince.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.385
I want to be your boyfriend.

00:13:12.343 --> 00:13:14.034
Your highness, I want to tell you that—

00:13:15.084 --> 00:13:15.906
I'm Wave!

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:18.724
Wave.

00:13:21.108 --> 00:13:23.679
Everything that happened wasn't
Paolo's order.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.871
It was my real feeling.

00:13:27.446 --> 00:13:28.675
When I said I loved you, I meant it.

00:13:29.835 --> 00:13:31.058
When I got jealous, it was fierce.

00:13:32.873 --> 00:13:34.759
When I wanted to hug you, I really did.

00:13:36.596 --> 00:13:38.047
I've never lied about any of it.

00:13:39.709 --> 00:13:40.589
Can you believe me?

00:13:55.974 --> 00:13:59.586
Being your boyfriend is way better
than being a prince.

00:14:09.822 --> 00:14:10.839
What a regret!

00:14:11.583 --> 00:14:13.971
I missed my chance to brag to the whole island
that my boyfriend is a prince.

00:14:15.524 --> 00:14:16.300
Stop it.

00:14:17.459 --> 00:14:18.689
Come on, just let me do it.

00:14:19.017 --> 00:14:20.152
I'm proud, okay?

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:26.487
My boyfriend is a prince!

00:14:26.487 --> 00:14:28.280
Lava, stop it!

00:14:28.849 --> 00:14:29.893
We're moving so fast.

00:14:29.893 --> 00:14:31.386
No one can hear us anyway.

00:14:31.561 --> 00:14:33.246
My boyfriend is a prince!

00:14:33.246 --> 00:14:34.970
Woohoo!

00:14:43.719 --> 00:14:46.941
My boyfriend is a prince!

00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:50.469
Woohoo!

00:15:01.785 --> 00:15:03.324
Damn, why isn't Tum here yet?

00:15:03.454 --> 00:15:04.461
I already called to wake him up.

00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:05.181
Will he make it in time?

00:15:06.388 --> 00:15:07.057
There he is!

00:15:07.633 --> 00:15:08.313
Coming!

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.805
Tum, it took you long enough
to wake up and come vote!

00:15:11.805 --> 00:15:13.976
If I hadn't called, you'd still be asleep.

00:15:13.976 --> 00:15:15.742
Every single vote counts!

00:15:15.742 --> 00:15:17.139
Yeah, yeah, I know.

00:15:17.139 --> 00:15:18.617
I'll mark a big tick.

00:15:18.617 --> 00:15:19.586
Just hurry up and get in there!

00:15:20.106 --> 00:15:21.163
And don't tick the wrong box, got it?

00:15:21.163 --> 00:15:22.121
Hey, wait up!

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:22.833
Hurry up.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:29.933
Valid vote, number 5.

00:15:29.933 --> 00:15:31.448
Yay!

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:38.022
Valid vote, number 5.

00:15:38.022 --> 00:15:39.280
Yay!

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:45.730
Valid vote, number 2.

00:15:45.841 --> 00:15:48.440
Yay!

00:15:55.118 --> 00:15:57.030
Valid vote, number 2.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:59.082
Yay!

00:16:02.314 --> 00:16:03.943
Valid vote, number 5.

00:16:06.209 --> 00:16:06.824
Let's go!

00:16:13.083 --> 00:16:13.583
Valid vote…

00:16:13.583 --> 00:16:14.401
number 2!

00:16:15.869 --> 00:16:16.600
Wait!

00:16:16.767 --> 00:16:18.008
That ballot's torn like that.

00:16:18.157 --> 00:16:19.303
Does it still count as a valid vote?

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:20.894
Hey! Hey!

00:16:21.265 --> 00:16:22.616
Check it one more time.

00:16:22.616 --> 00:16:24.531
How could you do that?

00:16:25.571 --> 00:16:26.071
We're sorry.

00:16:26.312 --> 00:16:27.034
Correction.

00:16:27.034 --> 00:16:27.707
This is a spoiled ballot.

00:16:30.679 --> 00:16:32.031
Check carefully!

00:16:33.684 --> 00:16:34.306
VILLAGE HEAD ELECTION
BALLOT BOX

00:16:34.306 --> 00:16:36.809
And the final vote goes to number—

00:16:45.041 --> 00:16:46.134
Uncle Peng, let's go!

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:48.410
Tum, hurry!

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.595
Uncle Peng, start the car!

00:16:52.561 --> 00:16:53.536
Tum, close it up.

00:16:58.663 --> 00:16:59.326
Let's go!

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.133
Go, quick!

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:10.286
Dr. Wut!

00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.838
Dr. Wut!

00:17:13.788 --> 00:17:14.541
Dr. Wut!

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:16.057
Where is he?

00:17:16.057 --> 00:17:16.962
He's probably in the back room.

00:17:16.962 --> 00:17:17.685
I'll take you there.

00:17:17.685 --> 00:17:18.239
Let's go.

00:17:24.573 --> 00:17:25.779
Hey, there he is.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:31.168
What's going on?

00:17:31.521 --> 00:17:32.660
Why is everyone here?

00:17:33.087 --> 00:17:33.935
Is someone hurt?

00:17:35.161 --> 00:17:36.050
And what about the election result?

00:17:42.569 --> 00:17:43.275
Dr. Wut.

00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:53.378
I've been elected as the new village head.

00:17:53.861 --> 00:17:54.697
Are you serious?

00:17:55.013 --> 00:17:55.710
Yeah.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:57.869
Are you sure there's no surprise twist?

00:17:58.278 --> 00:17:58.955
Uh-huh.

00:18:10.957 --> 00:18:11.917
What are you doing?

00:18:15.927 --> 00:18:18.245
Now that I've done what the director asked,

00:18:18.319 --> 00:18:19.854
I want to do things right.

00:18:20.857 --> 00:18:22.241
No more hiding.

00:18:25.064 --> 00:18:27.043
Let everyone in the hospital
be our witnesses.

00:18:27.043 --> 00:18:28.763
I'm ready to take care of you…

00:18:33.452 --> 00:18:34.412
forever.

00:18:35.898 --> 00:18:37.592
From now on,
there will be no more secret places.

00:18:38.372 --> 00:18:40.330
Let's love each other openly,
so the whole island knows.

00:18:45.085 --> 00:18:47.620
Will you marry me?

00:18:52.152 --> 00:18:53.018
Are you serious?

00:18:56.075 --> 00:18:56.779
Yes, I am.

00:18:57.262 --> 00:18:58.186
Then, say yes!

00:18:58.186 --> 00:19:07.374
Get married! Get married! Get married!

00:19:13.299 --> 00:19:14.686
After waiting this long,

00:19:15.708 --> 00:19:16.720
of course, my answer is yes.

00:19:42.714 --> 00:19:44.156
Just wait until it's my turn.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.080
I'll make mine an even bigger scene.

00:19:54.281 --> 00:19:57.150
Hey, Dao, are you so touched
you can't hold it in?

00:19:57.521 --> 00:19:58.299
Tum,

00:19:59.599 --> 00:20:01.035
I'm not peeing.

00:20:01.833 --> 00:20:04.084
I'm in labor!

00:20:04.084 --> 00:20:04.724
What?!

00:20:04.724 --> 00:20:06.885
Oh no!

00:20:07.238 --> 00:20:08.333
Excuse me!

00:20:10.525 --> 00:20:12.950
Your baby is so cute, Dao,

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.456
looking just like you.

00:20:16.666 --> 00:20:17.888
Have you picked a name yet?

00:20:20.024 --> 00:20:22.093
I haven't had any idea so far.

00:20:23.356 --> 00:20:24.769
How about “Kuha,” Dao?

00:20:25.326 --> 00:20:26.877
It fits with the election theme.

00:20:27.824 --> 00:20:29.374
What kind of name is that?

00:20:29.374 --> 00:20:30.337
It's so weird.

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:33.312
Save that name for your own kid, Tum.

00:20:33.461 --> 00:20:35.896
Hey, my kid is your kid too, you know.

00:20:38.552 --> 00:20:40.343
We can have the monk pick it for you later.

00:20:42.275 --> 00:20:43.960
Sure, whatever you say.

00:20:44.201 --> 00:20:45.316
What does that have to do with me, Dao?

00:20:46.003 --> 00:20:48.161
I'm your employer, not the baby's father.

00:20:50.147 --> 00:20:52.182
Then I'll prepare some
postpartum meals for you.

00:20:54.002 --> 00:20:55.451
Thank you so much, Doctor.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:01.946
The baby's got their fists all clenched up.

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:04.231
See? The baby must like you.

00:21:05.744 --> 00:21:06.771
You like him, right?

00:21:07.923 --> 00:21:10.488
Well, kids and I are made for each other.

00:21:24.132 --> 00:21:26.069
Today's just full of good things.

00:21:28.224 --> 00:21:29.730
Uncle Peng became village head,

00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:32.514
proposed to Dr. Wut,

00:21:33.368 --> 00:21:35.036
and Dao just gave birth.

00:21:37.209 --> 00:21:38.901
So many happy things happened.

00:21:42.672 --> 00:21:47.153
Yeah, today's been super fun and wild.

00:21:47.524 --> 00:21:49.144
It was like an action scene
when her water broke.

00:21:55.961 --> 00:21:59.127
Do you know what I'm afraid of?

00:22:00.074 --> 00:22:00.622
What?

00:22:03.055 --> 00:22:06.816
I'm afraid that when I go back
to being a prince,

00:22:07.782 --> 00:22:10.951
I won't be as happy as I am right now.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:14.555
Don't be dramatic.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:19.670
Living in a big palace, eating good food,

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.674
and having people serve you—

00:22:22.677 --> 00:22:23.773
that's super comfortable.

00:22:26.299 --> 00:22:30.062
What if my happiness
isn't about having a big house?

00:22:34.743 --> 00:22:35.991
My happiness is

00:22:37.774 --> 00:22:39.882
seeing the people I love happy.

00:22:43.504 --> 00:22:44.908
Seeing Tum,

00:22:46.413 --> 00:22:47.231
Kratae,

00:22:49.486 --> 00:22:50.376
Aomsin,

00:22:52.066 --> 00:22:57.521
and Dao happy is enough for me.

00:23:01.002 --> 00:23:02.463
Wherever you go,

00:23:03.299 --> 00:23:05.086
you'll always be valuable to others.

00:23:08.504 --> 00:23:09.520
Let me tell you something.

00:23:10.709 --> 00:23:12.699
I'm not going anywhere.

00:23:14.054 --> 00:23:15.650
My heart belongs here.

00:23:17.192 --> 00:23:20.341
And you're not allowed to make me leave.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.289
I won't.

00:23:24.289 --> 00:23:27.124
I'll tie up your body, your arms,
and your legs to keep you right here.

00:23:34.556 --> 00:23:35.445
- Got it.
- I'm not letting you go anywhere.

00:24:18.271 --> 00:24:18.955
Mom!

00:24:23.356 --> 00:24:24.441
Mom? How did you get here?

00:24:24.608 --> 00:24:25.699
Peng called me.

00:24:25.903 --> 00:24:27.473
He said he needed my help,

00:24:27.844 --> 00:24:30.373
and I wanted to see how you're doing.

00:24:32.472 --> 00:24:33.346
And who's this?

00:24:38.386 --> 00:24:39.165
This is Wave.

00:24:39.462 --> 00:24:40.538
He's my boyfriend.

00:24:40.835 --> 00:24:41.542
Boyfriend?

00:24:42.563 --> 00:24:44.321
Why didn't you ever tell me?

00:24:44.804 --> 00:24:45.964
Did you meet here?

00:24:46.187 --> 00:24:47.776
It's a long story.

00:24:47.776 --> 00:24:49.010
I'll tell you later when I have time.

00:24:50.832 --> 00:24:51.604
Hello.

00:24:53.201 --> 00:24:54.820
I'll wait outside for breakfast then.

00:25:01.699 --> 00:25:04.041
Hey, your mom isn't mad, is she?

00:25:05.583 --> 00:25:06.802
No, she's fine.

00:25:06.802 --> 00:25:08.106
I didn't do anything wrong.

00:25:08.273 --> 00:25:10.916
Also, I'm legally an adult now.

00:25:10.916 --> 00:25:11.771
I can do what I want.

00:25:18.662 --> 00:25:19.702
Hey, stop.

00:25:19.925 --> 00:25:21.082
Your mom's waiting for you.

00:25:21.992 --> 00:25:23.473
She won't be mad.

00:25:23.975 --> 00:25:27.284
If I tell her the truth,
she'll be shocked for sure.

00:25:30.944 --> 00:25:31.672
That's enough.

00:25:31.876 --> 00:25:32.376
Your mom is—

00:25:32.636 --> 00:25:33.201
Hey!

00:25:33.851 --> 00:25:34.464
Ow!

00:25:35.114 --> 00:25:35.740
Enough!

00:25:36.446 --> 00:25:37.049
Ouch!

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.835
You're cooking by yourself now?

00:25:40.195 --> 00:25:42.003
At home, you never even touched a spatula.

00:25:42.563 --> 00:25:46.333
Well, people have to change sometimes
for their loved ones.

00:25:48.074 --> 00:25:50.506
You make it sound like an ad slogan.

00:25:51.446 --> 00:25:52.831
Just make sure you keep it up.

00:25:56.552 --> 00:25:58.120
So, Wave, are you from around here?

00:26:06.792 --> 00:26:07.489
Yes.

00:26:07.489 --> 00:26:08.856
I was born and raised in Bangsawan.

00:26:08.856 --> 00:26:10.111
My full name is Nava Mahasamut.

00:26:10.111 --> 00:26:11.040
I'm twenty-three years old.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:11.920
My father's a fisherman.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:12.880
My mother teaches music,

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.582
and now I'm a tutor
for secondary school students.

00:26:14.702 --> 00:26:17.321
I only asked a short question,
and you gave me a whole essay.

00:26:19.782 --> 00:26:21.496
So how did you and Lava meet?

00:26:28.819 --> 00:26:29.917
It was very romantic.

00:26:29.917 --> 00:26:32.414
That day, I went swimming
and got pulled out by the waves.

00:26:32.414 --> 00:26:34.289
Lava saw me and saved my life.

00:26:34.289 --> 00:26:36.573
I was touched by how heroic
and talented he was,

00:26:36.573 --> 00:26:37.932
so I went after him
until he became my boyfriend.

00:26:38.632 --> 00:26:41.246
Wow, that sounds like something
straight out of the series.

00:26:41.887 --> 00:26:45.158
You never think about your own safety, huh?

00:26:45.438 --> 00:26:46.860
You're always helping others.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.689
It's lucky nothing happened to you.

00:26:49.649 --> 00:26:51.250
Even when I did something good,

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:52.722
you still scolded me, Mom.

00:26:54.143 --> 00:26:55.452
Please don't be too hard on Lava.

00:26:55.892 --> 00:26:59.744
If it weren't for him, I wouldn't be alive today.

00:27:01.225 --> 00:27:04.095
I'm not mad. I'm just worried.

00:27:04.895 --> 00:27:05.659
I'll eat now.

00:27:10.761 --> 00:27:12.391
You really gave a solid background story.

00:27:13.271 --> 00:27:14.940
So? I'm good at this, right?

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.744
I made you look cool in front of my mom too.

00:27:20.305 --> 00:27:21.781
My boyfriend is amazing.

00:27:22.501 --> 00:27:25.585
Now, this chef will make his
very own omelette for you.

00:27:55.691 --> 00:27:58.050
Lava looks so happy living here.

00:27:59.991 --> 00:28:03.830
He gets to be himself
with no expectation or pressure.

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:05.326
That must feel freeing.

00:28:07.587 --> 00:28:10.184
Are you talking about Lava
or about yourself?

00:28:12.005 --> 00:28:14.883
Why didn't you tell Dad and Mom
you're getting married?

00:28:15.503 --> 00:28:17.161
They could be here as your family elders.

00:28:17.701 --> 00:28:19.487
Wouldn't that be better than having me?

00:28:24.321 --> 00:28:25.667
Even if I told them, they wouldn't come.

00:28:27.988 --> 00:28:29.150
I didn't want to be disappointed.

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:33.334
You should try to understand them.

00:28:33.414 --> 00:28:34.876
They're old.

00:28:34.876 --> 00:28:37.112
It takes time for them to catch up.

00:28:37.112 --> 00:28:40.497
But if I keep waiting for them to catch up,
when will I get to live my own life?

00:28:40.997 --> 00:28:43.778
I'd probably end up becoming a civil servant
and marrying their friend's daughter

00:28:44.118 --> 00:28:48.340
only to feel sorry for her later
and end up divorced.

00:28:49.981 --> 00:28:53.456
You've got to live the life you wanted.

00:28:54.236 --> 00:28:57.156
Have you ever asked how I've been, huh?

00:29:00.077 --> 00:29:04.014
When you left, I became their hope.

00:29:05.434 --> 00:29:08.181
I had to have a good husband,
and give them a grandchild.

00:29:10.142 --> 00:29:14.315
Did it ever cross your mind that
maybe I wanted a life like yours too?

00:29:28.492 --> 00:29:31.597
I'm sorry, sis, for being selfish.

00:29:35.078 --> 00:29:36.443
You weren't selfish.

00:29:39.224 --> 00:29:40.397
It's just that you were brave.

00:29:45.403 --> 00:29:50.005
Honestly, I'm glad I sent my son
to live with you here.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.950
He looks so happy.

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:55.652
I think he's learned something from you.

00:29:56.112 --> 00:29:58.432
Come on. He's nothing like me.

00:29:59.152 --> 00:30:00.420
He's way more hot-headed.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.767
Sometimes he's so hot-headed
that I have to hold him back.

00:30:06.028 --> 00:30:07.365
But don't worry about him.

00:30:07.605 --> 00:30:08.969
He can get by.

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:13.402
There's only one thing that concerns me,

00:30:22.858 --> 00:30:24.836
but it's better if he learns it on his own.

00:30:27.737 --> 00:30:28.856
You're quite the wise talker now.

00:30:39.682 --> 00:30:42.479
PONGSAKORN & SARAWUT

00:30:48.221 --> 00:30:48.870
Thanks.

00:30:51.451 --> 00:30:52.915
You're taking my son now, Peng.

00:30:52.915 --> 00:30:54.253
Take good care of him.

00:30:54.913 --> 00:30:58.455
He's my only son, and I love him very much.

00:30:59.836 --> 00:31:01.422
I'll take the best care of Dr. Wut.

00:31:05.524 --> 00:31:07.238
May you love each other for a long time

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.098
and not only on the good days.

00:31:10.378 --> 00:31:13.599
On the bad ones,
love each other a lot too.

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:15.644
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:31:19.125 --> 00:31:20.483
Congratulations, Dr. Wut.

00:31:23.864 --> 00:31:25.208
You finally found your person.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.927
A fake like me could never compare
to the real you.

00:31:30.047 --> 00:31:30.817
Thank you.

00:31:31.897 --> 00:31:32.762
Congratulations.

00:31:35.283 --> 00:31:36.328
Congratulations, Dr. Wut.

00:31:39.089 --> 00:31:40.346
You don't have to pour water on me, I guess.

00:31:41.186 --> 00:31:42.281
Of course I do, Uncle.

00:31:42.481 --> 00:31:44.881
I have to witness your love

00:31:44.961 --> 00:31:46.851
and send you off properly.

00:31:47.931 --> 00:31:49.629
No more hiding.

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:51.352
Go show it off.

00:31:52.072 --> 00:31:53.233
Stop teasing me.

00:31:55.314 --> 00:31:56.305
Thanks.

00:32:03.042 --> 00:32:06.437
You two are the perfect example
of the kind of love I want.

00:32:07.757 --> 00:32:10.373
You've overcome everything
to be together.

00:32:11.874 --> 00:32:15.346
I hope you and Dr. Wut.
stay in love forever.

00:32:16.787 --> 00:32:17.960
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:32:27.501 --> 00:32:30.420
Boss! You're leaving me!

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.729
You'll belong to someone else now!

00:32:32.929 --> 00:32:34.851
Tum, stop being dramatic.

00:32:35.071 --> 00:32:36.388
I'm only getting married for a day.

00:32:36.468 --> 00:32:38.260
I'll be back fishing with you tomorrow,
same as usual.

00:32:40.121 --> 00:32:42.626
Dr. Wut, please take good care of him.

00:32:43.426 --> 00:32:45.202
I love him with all my heart.

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.520
If he ever gets hurt, I'll come after you.

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.504
Tum, why are you threatening Dr. Wut?

00:32:52.604 --> 00:32:53.897
Those two truly love each other.

00:32:53.897 --> 00:32:55.514
They'll never leave one another.

00:32:57.035 --> 00:32:59.124
Wow, seeing this wedding
makes me want one too.

00:32:59.344 --> 00:33:01.720
Kratae, shall we get married?

00:33:03.641 --> 00:33:05.323
Learn to have some manners, will you?

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:58.179
Aren't you embarrassed in front of others?

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.298
You're a prince.

00:34:02.838 --> 00:34:04.300
How could you do this?

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:05.839
I don't want to be a prince.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.215
I'd rather be Wave.

00:34:10.376 --> 00:34:11.629
Then I can be sweet,

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:14.181
do whatever I want,

00:34:15.161 --> 00:34:19.280
wherever and whenever I want, with you.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:26.566
Hey!

00:34:31.322 --> 00:34:32.872
Play like this and you'll get it yourself!

00:34:33.492 --> 00:34:34.194
Fine.

00:34:43.328 --> 00:34:44.287
Are you challenging me, huh?

00:34:46.388 --> 00:34:47.594
But you look handsome today.

00:34:48.074 --> 00:34:49.567
I don't want to mess up my boyfriend's face.

00:35:15.129 --> 00:35:17.524
BANGSAWAN MOO KRA TA

00:35:23.513 --> 00:35:25.621
Tonight, I'd like to sing a song for a woman

00:35:27.482 --> 00:35:29.324
who feels special to me.

00:35:31.945 --> 00:35:33.692
She inspires me to be better,

00:35:35.573 --> 00:35:37.014
to quit being reckless,

00:35:39.155 --> 00:35:41.074
and to dream of building a family
with her in the future.

00:35:44.675 --> 00:35:46.784
I dedicate this song to show my sincerity.

00:35:48.905 --> 00:35:50.732
I'm so inspired tonight!

00:35:58.874 --> 00:36:01.594

The fireworks will start soon.

00:38:50.658 --> 00:38:55.527
Seeing Uncle Peng happy today
makes me feel glad.

00:38:57.610 --> 00:38:58.297
That's good.

00:38:58.297 --> 00:38:59.477
Now they don't have to hide anymore.

00:39:00.484 --> 00:39:03.007
Next time, they can kiss each other
on the cheek in front of everyone.

00:39:03.212 --> 00:39:03.763
Like this.

00:39:12.145 --> 00:39:13.002
And what about you?

00:39:13.839 --> 00:39:15.021
Have you ever thought about marriage?

00:39:18.316 --> 00:39:19.324
Marriage?

00:39:20.143 --> 00:39:20.736
No,

00:39:22.204 --> 00:39:22.935
not at all.

00:39:23.721 --> 00:39:29.461
I don't think love needs
any kind of certification.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.833
As long as the two people know,
that's enough.

00:39:33.694 --> 00:39:36.231
But I think it's not that simple.

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:40.263
No one is born alone.

00:39:41.543 --> 00:39:45.772
We all have parents and people around us
to care about.

00:39:48.179 --> 00:39:51.953
Still, if we live just to please everyone else,

00:39:52.619 --> 00:39:53.690
we'll never be happy.

00:39:57.856 --> 00:39:58.577
Why are you asking?

00:39:59.328 --> 00:40:01.300
Do you want to get married, my boyfriend?

00:40:04.237 --> 00:40:05.092
Yeah, I do.

00:40:06.372 --> 00:40:10.606
I feel like it's a promise between two people.

00:40:11.221 --> 00:40:13.946
They'll love and
take care of each other forever.

00:40:16.029 --> 00:40:17.661
You don't need a wedding
to make a promise.

00:40:19.266 --> 00:40:19.899
Really?

00:40:41.256 --> 00:40:41.811
Ouch!

00:40:43.757 --> 00:40:44.746
What are you doing?

00:40:45.105 --> 00:40:45.826
It's an engagement.

00:40:49.821 --> 00:40:52.212
I promise that no matter what happens,

00:40:52.963 --> 00:40:55.149
I'll do everything I can to stay with you,
my boyfriend.

00:41:04.016 --> 00:41:05.309
Ouch! That hurts!

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:08.143
Good. Then you'll remember it.

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:13.209
I promise too.

00:41:15.394 --> 00:41:16.679
No matter what happens,

00:41:17.498 --> 00:41:19.828
I'll do whatever it takes for us to be together.

00:41:22.748 --> 00:41:24.143
No one will ever come between us.

00:42:53.633 --> 00:42:56.503
Hey, I'll be right back.

00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:59.165
I'm grabbing the cake from my motorbike.

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.215
I'm getting a little hungry.

00:43:02.915 --> 00:43:03.645
Wait for me here, okay?

00:43:06.582 --> 00:43:07.469
Should I come with you?

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.911
It's okay. I'll go myself.

00:43:10.065 --> 00:43:10.699
Stay here.

00:43:40.423 --> 00:43:41.166
Hello, Tum?

00:43:44.825 --> 00:43:46.457
I brought Wave to see the fireworks
at the pier.

00:43:50.106 --> 00:43:51.544
Yeah, we'll hurry back.

00:43:51.835 --> 00:43:52.712
Don't get too drunk, okay?

00:43:52.712 --> 00:43:53.547
Save some for us.

00:43:55.459 --> 00:43:56.348
Okay.

00:44:20.633 --> 00:44:21.134
Wave!

00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:48.823
Wave.

00:44:49.967 --> 00:44:51.112
Why Wave?

00:44:51.112 --> 00:44:53.040
Because the wave brought you to me.

00:44:55.635 --> 00:44:59.758
Being alone, not knowing where I come from

00:45:00.817 --> 00:45:02.113
or having anyone in my life,

00:45:05.732 --> 00:45:06.988
is worse.

00:45:09.634 --> 00:45:11.443
I want to have memories I can look back on.

00:45:11.702 --> 00:45:13.208
I've made my choice.

00:45:13.208 --> 00:45:16.069
No one can force me.

00:46:01.055 --> 00:46:01.611
Wave.

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:03.617
Who are you?

00:46:04.607 --> 00:46:07.785
Are you seriously telling me
you don't remember anything from the last three months?

00:46:08.024 --> 00:46:09.354
You just try, then.

00:46:09.354 --> 00:46:10.722
I don't even know how to help you.

00:46:11.729 --> 00:46:16.214
You have to make the prince remember every moment when he used to be Wave.

00:46:17.136 --> 00:46:18.659
Have you ever known what hardship is?

00:46:18.659 --> 00:46:20.535
Being like this, how could you even rule anyone?

00:46:20.672 --> 00:46:22.409
There's no way I'd ever like someone like you.

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:23.440
You're rude!

00:46:23.867 --> 00:46:27.696
Even if I only have one day, one hour, or one minute left,

00:46:27.798 --> 00:46:30.499
I'll make you remember what happened between us.
