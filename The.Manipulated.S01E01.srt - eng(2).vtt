-If you want,

I'll take these down for you, sir.

Taejin, have you eaten yet?

Come on, man. You gotta eat something.

00:03:00.535 --> 00:03:01.620
How's the studying?

00:03:01.703 --> 00:03:03.497
Am I gonna be impressed this time?

No, I'm probably gonna bruise now.

Oh, hey, I wouldn't go that way right now.

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.226

I can't believe this.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.249
Appreciate the tip.

Hey, man.

00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:02.050
I caught up to that douchebag
in the sports car,

00:06:02.133 --> 00:06:03.176
and I got him to pay us back.

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:05.011
So, I'll send you the money in a bit.

00:06:05.887 --> 00:06:06.888
Sounds good.

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:09.724

Oh, Hyung.

00:06:15.855 --> 00:06:17.315
Sorry. I'll catch you later.

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:18.566
Later.

00:06:19.567 --> 00:06:20.610
This looks great.

00:06:21.194 --> 00:06:23.113
Come on, hurry up and eat
before it gets cold.

00:06:23.738 --> 00:06:24.823
Hmm.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.825
Why are you here?

00:06:26.908 --> 00:06:28.076
Are you still working right now?

00:06:30.078 --> 00:06:31.746
I had some things to take care of.

00:06:32.414 --> 00:06:33.665
Hmm.

00:06:33.748 --> 00:06:35.083
Well, at least...

00:06:35.166 --> 00:06:36.418
I'm easy to take care of.

00:06:36.501 --> 00:06:37.502
No complaints, right?

00:06:37.585 --> 00:06:39.713
I have so many, I can't even list them.

00:06:39.796 --> 00:06:41.756
We'd be here all night long if I tried.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.842

00:06:45.635 --> 00:06:46.761
Oh, right.

00:06:46.845 --> 00:06:48.179
So how's the shop turning out?

00:06:48.263 --> 00:06:50.640
Dude, let me show you. Look at this.

00:06:52.267 --> 00:06:54.352
We're almost ready for a grand opening.

00:06:54.894 --> 00:06:56.020
Pretty nice, right?

00:06:56.104 --> 00:06:57.897
[chuckles] I guess.

00:06:57.981 --> 00:07:00.358
But why does it look
like Mom decorated it?

00:07:00.442 --> 00:07:02.694
-[laughs]
-Is that where you got your taste from?

00:07:03.403 --> 00:07:05.655
You really think
good taste is passed down?

00:07:06.364 --> 00:07:08.491
Because I watched Mom a lot
when I helped her out.

00:07:08.575 --> 00:07:11.619
I picked up a lot of things
while you were outside messing around.

00:07:11.703 --> 00:07:12.829
[scoffs]

00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:14.748
Okay, fine. In that case,

00:07:14.831 --> 00:07:16.458
I'll stop messing around
and just head home.

00:07:16.541 --> 00:07:18.293
Wait. At least make sure
you finish your food.

00:07:18.376 --> 00:07:19.586
I'll eat while watching my shows.

00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:22.088
Come on, man.
Stop wasting your time, okay?

00:07:22.172 --> 00:07:23.506
-Oh, there you go.
-You're gonna fail.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.133
And will you ever stop nagging?

00:07:25.216 --> 00:07:27.927
-I'll limit it to five hours.
-Do you realize how late it is?

00:07:28.011 --> 00:07:30.096
In five hours, the sun will be
creeping through the window.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.306
[laughs]

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:32.932
Whatever, dude.

00:07:33.016 --> 00:07:34.809
It's not like it affects me if you fail.

00:07:34.893 --> 00:07:36.227
It's your life.

00:07:37.103 --> 00:07:38.271
[chuckles]

00:07:38.354 --> 00:07:40.148
I'll get an A. Stop worrying.

00:07:40.231 --> 00:07:41.941
-Have some faith in me.
-Have some faith?

00:07:42.025 --> 00:07:43.151
You'll be lucky if you pass.

00:07:43.234 --> 00:07:45.528
Maybe try opening up a textbook
instead of the internet.

00:07:45.612 --> 00:07:46.696
Right. I got it.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.364
Hey, you should get
some reflective lights.

00:07:48.907 --> 00:07:50.074
-It's dangerous at night.
-What?

00:07:50.158 --> 00:07:51.159
Okay, I will.

00:07:54.829 --> 00:07:55.872
Oh, by the way...

00:07:56.915 --> 00:07:58.541
I'll be paying respects
to Mom alone tomorrow.

00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:00.126
What? Why can't I come?

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:01.336
Don't even think about it.

00:08:01.419 --> 00:08:03.046
Your exam's coming up soon.

00:08:03.129 --> 00:08:04.547
Go on. You better study.

00:08:05.215 --> 00:08:06.216
See you Saturday.

00:08:07.342 --> 00:08:08.426
See you later.

Here we go.

I'm too old for this shit.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.729
[Daehoon] These look good together.

00:09:01.813 --> 00:09:03.273
[Taejoong breathing heavily] Jeez.

00:09:03.356 --> 00:09:05.400
-Wait hold on.
-[Daehoon] What?

00:09:05.483 --> 00:09:07.193
You know you can't plant
those in the same pot?

00:09:07.277 --> 00:09:08.319
-[Woojong] Why not?
-I got it.

00:09:08.403 --> 00:09:09.696
-Leave it there.
-[Daehoon] Okay.

00:09:09.779 --> 00:09:11.573
If you plant these guys so close together,

00:09:11.656 --> 00:09:13.616
-it'll be a disaster.
-Oh.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.118
The big ones steal all the nutrients

00:09:15.201 --> 00:09:17.328
from the smaller ones,
and then they end up dying.

00:09:17.412 --> 00:09:18.997
-Incoming.
-Bring it a little closer.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.373
-Okay, hold it steady.
-Yeah, I will.

00:09:20.456 --> 00:09:21.541
-You got it, right?
-I got you.

00:09:21.624 --> 00:09:22.667
-Don't let me fall.
-Taejoong!

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.043
-Yeah.
-Come on, dude, pay attention.

00:09:24.127 --> 00:09:25.879
-Hurry up!
-Is there a pot for this small one?

00:09:25.962 --> 00:09:27.547
Yeah, go over to the storage room

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.675
-and there should be one in there.
-[exhales] Sorry, I'm a little late.

00:09:30.758 --> 00:09:33.011
-It's all good.
-I brought some food for all of us.

00:09:33.094 --> 00:09:34.554
-Nice.
-Hold on.

00:09:35.138 --> 00:09:36.890
-[laughs] Who's hungry?
-I'm down. Let's eat.

00:09:36.973 --> 00:09:38.850
-Come down and eat.
-[Jeongsu] Here goes nothing!

-[all] Whoa.

00:09:43.062 --> 00:09:44.606
-Oh, it's so pretty.
-[Daehoon] Really nice.

00:09:44.689 --> 00:09:46.149
[Suji] It really looks amazing.

00:09:46.232 --> 00:09:48.443
Text me your bank info,
I'll pay you for your time today.

00:09:48.526 --> 00:09:50.320
You don't owe me anything.
We're friends, dummy.

00:09:50.403 --> 00:09:52.197
Hey, man, time is money, you know.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.531
It doesn't matter we're friends.

00:09:53.615 --> 00:09:55.700
So what's my pay then?

00:09:55.783 --> 00:09:56.784
Hundred?

00:09:56.868 --> 00:09:58.328
Only 100,000 won?

00:09:58.411 --> 00:09:59.913
-[laughing]
-That's all I mean to you?

00:09:59.996 --> 00:10:01.956
-You take checks?
-Not even worth it at that point.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.124
It's pretty, right?

00:10:04.292 --> 00:10:06.544
Great job, Taejoong. [chuckles]

00:10:06.628 --> 00:10:08.922
People love aesthetic cafes these days.

00:10:09.672 --> 00:10:12.175
How long do you think
you'll be doing deliveries?

00:10:12.258 --> 00:10:13.426
I'm not sure.

00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:16.221
I have to make sure this place
gets off the ground first.

00:10:16.304 --> 00:10:17.680
And I still have that loan.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:21.059
It must be tough working two jobs.

00:10:23.144 --> 00:10:25.855
Do you think I should have waited
till after Taejin graduated?

00:10:26.522 --> 00:10:28.483
I feel like I might have
rushed things as usual.

00:10:28.566 --> 00:10:29.734
[Suji chuckles]

00:10:29.817 --> 00:10:31.527
But that's what makes you charming.

00:10:32.946 --> 00:10:35.823
Waiting around for results
has never really worked out for me.

00:10:35.907 --> 00:10:36.908
[Daehoon] Okay, we're out.

00:10:37.575 --> 00:10:39.035
[Taejoong] Thanks again for helping out.

00:10:39.118 --> 00:10:41.246
-[Woojong chuckles] Good night.
-Get home safe.

00:10:44.999 --> 00:10:46.292
You know what I like about you?

00:10:46.376 --> 00:10:49.629
You always jump in headfirst
and figure the rest out later.

00:10:51.381 --> 00:10:53.299
-What if I said I like you more?
-[screams playfully]

00:10:53.383 --> 00:10:55.343
-Okay, okay!
-[both chuckle]

00:10:56.886 --> 00:10:58.972
-Let's go.
-Okay.

00:10:59.931 --> 00:11:00.974
-[chuckles]
-What?

00:11:01.808 --> 00:11:03.226
Why?

00:11:03.309 --> 00:11:04.727
Where are you going?

00:11:05.728 --> 00:11:06.813
I don't want to leave.

00:11:08.106 --> 00:11:09.357
[laughs]

00:11:12.235 --> 00:11:14.279
Can I sleep here tonight?

00:11:15.822 --> 00:11:16.906

No, no, wait.

00:12:55.338 --> 00:12:56.756
Ugh, shit.

THIS TREE NEEDS TO BE IN PARTIAL SUNLIGHT
TO KEEP ITS LEAVES FROM DRYING OUT

00:13:34.377 --> 00:13:36.003
[old lady] Excuse me, young man.

00:13:36.087 --> 00:13:37.338
Could you lend a hand?

00:13:37.422 --> 00:13:38.506
-One moment, ma'am.
-Thank you.

00:13:38.589 --> 00:13:39.882
I'll be right back to help you.

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:42.885
So, what can I do for you?

00:13:42.969 --> 00:13:44.679
Could you take this up there for me?

00:13:44.762 --> 00:13:45.888
-Up the hill?
-Yeah.

00:13:45.972 --> 00:13:47.974
-If you don't mind.
-[grunting] Yeah, no problem.

00:13:48.057 --> 00:13:49.058
I got it.

Hmm?

What?

00:14:34.979 --> 00:14:36.272
[cell phone continues ringing]

00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:43.070

00:14:45.907 --> 00:14:46.908
[woman] Hello?

00:14:46.991 --> 00:14:48.492
Oh, thank God, you found my phone.

00:14:48.576 --> 00:14:49.869
I lost it earlier.

00:14:49.952 --> 00:14:51.204
Where was it?

00:14:51.287 --> 00:14:52.955
Oh, well, you know, the...

00:14:53.998 --> 00:14:56.375
The convenience store
by the district office?

00:14:56.459 --> 00:14:57.501
It was in the bushes.

00:14:58.169 --> 00:15:00.546
[woman] I'm sorry to ask,
but could you bring it to me?

00:15:02.506 --> 00:15:05.551
Actually, I can't right now
because I'm on the clock.

00:15:05.635 --> 00:15:08.346
I'll just leave it with the clerk
inside the convenience store.

00:15:09.138 --> 00:15:11.015
[woman] Can't you just
bring it to me yourself?

00:15:11.098 --> 00:15:13.559
I'll pay you 300,000 won for your trouble.

00:15:14.268 --> 00:15:15.353
300,000?

00:15:15.436 --> 00:15:19.106
[woman] My mom injured her leg,
so I can't leave her right now.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.025
You'd be doing me a huge favor.

00:15:23.402 --> 00:15:25.863
All right. Send me your address
and I'll be on my way.

00:15:26.447 --> 00:15:27.907
-[woman] Thank you so much.
-Sure.

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:29.075
[cell phone chimes]

00:15:29.158 --> 00:15:31.744
[Taejoong] For 300,000 won,
I'll take a plane if I have to.

00:15:52.348 --> 00:15:53.349
[sighs]

00:16:03.985 --> 00:16:04.986
What is this place?

00:16:11.993 --> 00:16:13.577
-[cell phone ringing]
-Oh, shit.

00:16:21.377 --> 00:16:22.420
Yes. Hello, ma'am.

00:16:22.962 --> 00:16:24.505
[woman] Hey, are you there yet?

00:16:25.256 --> 00:16:29.677
Yeah, I made it to the address, but...
it just led me to the front of a tunnel.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.761
Are you here?

00:16:30.845 --> 00:16:32.722
[woman] I told you
my mom isn't feeling well,

00:16:32.805 --> 00:16:34.015
so I can't meet with you.

00:16:34.098 --> 00:16:37.059
But if you head inside the tunnel,
you'll see an emergency phone box.

00:16:37.143 --> 00:16:38.894
I left the payment in there.

00:16:38.978 --> 00:16:41.731
Well, I don't mind delivering it
straight to your house.

00:16:41.814 --> 00:16:43.357
Can you give me your address?

00:16:43.441 --> 00:16:45.943
It's probably safer than leaving it here.

00:16:46.027 --> 00:16:49.196
[woman] Well, I'm not comfortable
giving my address to a stranger.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.115
Just leave my phone inside the box.

00:16:51.198 --> 00:16:53.534
Okay, sure.
Yeah, I see the box in the tunnel.

00:16:53.617 --> 00:16:54.910
I'll leave it in there.

00:16:54.994 --> 00:16:55.995
Thank you, ma'am.

00:16:57.038 --> 00:16:58.414
[cell phone chimes]

00:17:01.167 --> 00:17:02.168
Weird.

00:17:03.419 --> 00:17:04.462
Why inside here?

Are you fucking serious?

There's a person here, you dickhead.

00:17:54.136 --> 00:17:55.638
You scared the shit out of me.

Hey, Mom.

00:18:26.836 --> 00:18:29.672
Taejin couldn't make it,
so it'll just be the two of us today.

00:18:29.755 --> 00:18:31.966
I told him to stay home
because he needs to study.

00:18:32.049 --> 00:18:33.592
So don't be too upset with him.

00:18:34.218 --> 00:18:38.889
The thing is, no matter how much I nag him
to work harder, he keeps failing.

00:18:39.598 --> 00:18:42.518
I don't remember the exams
being all that hard.

00:18:43.269 --> 00:18:44.395
Anyway...

00:18:46.063 --> 00:18:47.314
Okay. Bon appétit.

00:18:49.024 --> 00:18:50.568
-You're so predictable.
-Hey.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:52.862
What are you doing here?

00:18:52.945 --> 00:18:54.739
[Taejin] I knew you'd forget
to bring Mom a gift.

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.991
What?

00:18:57.658 --> 00:18:59.243
Forget it. Let's just eat.

00:18:59.326 --> 00:19:01.328
You know you're supposed to be studying.

00:19:01.412 --> 00:19:05.416
Come on. How can I
when you're talking behind my back? Huh?

00:19:06.459 --> 00:19:08.461
Mom, he was talking about me, wasn't he?

00:19:08.544 --> 00:19:10.880
I wasn't saying anything
negative about you.

00:19:10.963 --> 00:19:12.131
I'm just worried.

00:19:12.214 --> 00:19:15.551
I was telling her how you're losing
more and more brain cells every day.

00:19:15.634 --> 00:19:16.802
My brain cells are doing fine.

00:19:16.886 --> 00:19:18.721
Thank you. Okay, what do we have here?

00:19:20.222 --> 00:19:21.974
-Where's my bowl of rice?
-There isn't one.

00:19:22.057 --> 00:19:23.642
I only brought enough for the two of us.

00:19:23.726 --> 00:19:25.144
But I haven't eaten all day.

00:19:25.978 --> 00:19:27.772
I won't be able
to study if I don't eat, all right?

00:19:28.689 --> 00:19:29.982
Fine, be my guest.

00:19:30.733 --> 00:19:31.734
Eat up.

00:19:31.817 --> 00:19:32.818
What about you?

00:19:33.611 --> 00:19:34.904
It's okay. I'm not hungry.

00:19:38.866 --> 00:19:40.534
Do you at least want a bite?

00:19:40.618 --> 00:19:43.579

possibly have to kill anyone?

00:22:31.372 --> 00:22:33.874
This seriously has to be
some sort of mistake.

00:22:33.958 --> 00:22:35.125
I swear I didn't do it.

00:22:35.209 --> 00:22:37.086
How many times do I have to tell you?

00:22:43.717 --> 00:22:45.844
[sighs heavily]

00:22:48.973 --> 00:22:50.474
When are you gonna let me go?

00:22:50.557 --> 00:22:52.267
Once you've answered all of our questions.

00:22:52.351 --> 00:22:54.311
You dragged me here with no explanation

00:22:54.395 --> 00:22:56.689
and asked me a bunch of questions
I don't know the answers to.

00:22:56.772 --> 00:22:58.691
There's no way
this whole thing here is legal.

00:22:58.774 --> 00:23:00.067
[detective 2] Pipe down, will you?

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:02.194
Given the situation,
we didn't need a warrant.

00:23:02.277 --> 00:23:05.155
Even so, don't people
deserve basic human rights?

00:23:05.239 --> 00:23:06.949
I mean, how can you do this?

00:23:07.032 --> 00:23:09.243
There was no time for me
to even close up my shop.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.121
Can we just go
and lock the doors at least?

00:23:12.204 --> 00:23:14.289
[detective 1] Hey, fuckface!
You don't get it, do you?

00:23:14.999 --> 00:23:16.750
Is this a joke to you, huh?

00:23:16.834 --> 00:23:19.545
I don't think you understand
the amount of shit you're in.

00:23:24.383 --> 00:23:25.926
Can I please have my phone call?

00:23:28.554 --> 00:23:30.514
I have to ask a friend
to take care of my shop.

00:23:30.597 --> 00:23:33.851
If my plants don't get watered,
they're gonna die.

00:23:34.518 --> 00:23:35.769
Hmm.

00:23:35.853 --> 00:23:37.730
Don't let this lying asshole
near any phones

00:23:37.813 --> 00:23:39.898
-until he tells the truth, okay?
-Yes, sir.

00:23:39.982 --> 00:23:41.483
-[knock on door]
-[detective 1] Come in.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.361
Hey.

00:23:44.945 --> 00:23:46.030
FORENSIC INVESTIGATION

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.658
[investigator] Please cooperate.

00:23:50.826 --> 00:23:52.119
Uh...

00:23:53.412 --> 00:23:55.039
[pants]

00:23:55.122 --> 00:23:56.373
[investigator] Open your mouth.

00:23:56.957 --> 00:23:57.958
And say, "Ah."

SUSPECT ARRESTED
IN GRUESOME DISMEMBERMENT MURDER

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.521
[Woojong] Taejoong.

00:24:20.314 --> 00:24:21.482
[Daehoon] You look rough.

00:24:21.565 --> 00:24:22.816
Are those real?

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.443
I mean, why would they make--

00:24:24.526 --> 00:24:25.778
I've been through a lot of shit

00:24:25.861 --> 00:24:27.571
-but this is a first.
-How are you holding up?

00:24:27.654 --> 00:24:29.990
You need to be in handcuffs
just to talk with us?

00:24:30.074 --> 00:24:32.034
They haven't taken them off me
since I got here.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.081
[Jeongsu] So... how are you holding up?

00:24:37.164 --> 00:24:38.957
You look like you haven't slept in days.

00:24:39.041 --> 00:24:40.250
[groans] Yeah, I'm okay.

00:24:40.334 --> 00:24:42.002
Actually, I'm not okay.

00:24:42.669 --> 00:24:44.880
But seeing you guys
is helping me feel better.

00:24:44.963 --> 00:24:46.882
Hey, could you guys do me a favor?

00:24:46.965 --> 00:24:49.676
Can you ask the flower shop owner
to swing by my store

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.720
and check up on the plants for me?

00:24:51.804 --> 00:24:52.805
A few days, max.

00:24:53.472 --> 00:24:54.848
Tell her I'll make it up when I'm out.

00:24:54.932 --> 00:24:56.350
Uh, Taejoong--

00:24:56.433 --> 00:24:58.685
Man, the people here
must be deaf or something.

00:24:58.769 --> 00:25:01.730
I don't know how many times
I have to tell them the truth.

00:25:01.814 --> 00:25:03.524
-It's like they don't care.
-Taejoong, listen.

00:25:03.607 --> 00:25:06.985
You probably don't know what's
going on since you're stuck in here.

00:25:07.611 --> 00:25:09.238
But it's getting kind of crazy out there.

00:25:10.114 --> 00:25:12.449
[Woojong] All your personal info
has been leaked online.

00:25:12.533 --> 00:25:13.867
It's a total shitstorm.

00:25:14.743 --> 00:25:16.245
What are you guys saying?

00:25:17.037 --> 00:25:18.497
Don't worry too much about it.

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:20.124
[Daehoon] Don't stress about it.

00:25:20.207 --> 00:25:21.875
Everything will work itself out, okay?

00:25:22.417 --> 00:25:23.544
So stay strong.

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:26.505
Wait, hold on.

00:25:26.588 --> 00:25:28.841
What kind of personal information
has been leaked?

00:25:31.969 --> 00:25:34.680
DIE, MURDERER

00:25:46.859 --> 00:25:48.944
[lawyer] I'll get you released
by tomorrow, so sit tight.

00:25:49.027 --> 00:25:50.195
Okay? Are you sure?

00:25:50.279 --> 00:25:51.655
What do you want now?

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.741
When are you gonna let me out?

00:25:56.451 --> 00:25:58.954
You must either be
a dumbass or delusional.

00:25:59.037 --> 00:26:00.497
I said I didn't do it.

00:26:00.581 --> 00:26:02.457
So why are you keeping me
locked up like an animal?

00:26:02.541 --> 00:26:05.043
Saying you didn't kill her
doesn't mean shit.

00:26:05.127 --> 00:26:06.962
We still have a dead victim.

00:26:07.045 --> 00:26:08.797
What you need is proof.

00:26:08.881 --> 00:26:09.923
Fucking liar.

00:26:10.632 --> 00:26:11.884
Proof?

00:26:12.593 --> 00:26:13.927
I've been telling you the truth.

00:26:14.011 --> 00:26:16.138
What more do you want from me?

00:26:16.221 --> 00:26:18.515
You fucking cops?
Think you could do whatever you want?

00:26:18.599 --> 00:26:19.600
Huh?

00:26:20.434 --> 00:26:23.103
When I get out,
I'm gonna sue the whole department!

00:26:24.396 --> 00:26:25.397
Good luck.

00:26:27.024 --> 00:26:28.150
Fucking nutcase!

00:26:30.194 --> 00:26:32.613
[groaning, panting]

00:26:37.159 --> 00:26:38.827
[crying]

00:26:41.496 --> 00:26:43.790
The Chu case shines a light on the rise

00:26:43.874 --> 00:26:46.293
of violent crimes
happening in the country.

00:26:46.376 --> 00:26:48.712
Can you offer any insight
into the mind of this killer?

00:26:48.795 --> 00:26:49.796
Of course.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:52.925
Given his troubled upbringing,
lack of higher education,

00:26:53.008 --> 00:26:55.510
and inability to hold a stable job,

00:26:55.594 --> 00:26:59.431
his crime was an expression of rage
over being unable to integrate into--

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:10.317
TEMPORARILY CLOSED

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.028

SONG SUJI

00:27:15.614 --> 00:27:17.241
Give me time to look over everything.

00:27:17.324 --> 00:27:19.409
Once that's done, I'll contact you. Okay?

00:27:19.493 --> 00:27:20.827
Thanks for meeting with us.

00:27:20.911 --> 00:27:22.704
-I'll be in touch.
-Thanks again.

00:27:24.623 --> 00:27:25.916
[Woojong] What was that?

00:27:25.999 --> 00:27:27.668
Who was that man you were just talking to?

00:27:27.751 --> 00:27:29.127
He's our lawyer.

00:27:29.211 --> 00:27:30.212
Suji hired him.

00:27:31.046 --> 00:27:33.215
He mentioned the faster we move,
the better.

00:27:33.924 --> 00:27:35.717
And I couldn't sit around and do nothing.

00:27:37.636 --> 00:27:38.637
Where should I put these?

00:27:39.554 --> 00:27:40.722
[Taejin] You can leave it there.

00:27:40.806 --> 00:27:41.890
I'll sort them later.

00:27:41.974 --> 00:27:43.308
[Jeongsu] All of us are here already.

00:27:43.392 --> 00:27:44.893
I'll just help you out.

00:27:44.977 --> 00:27:46.645
Did you bring these plants from the shop?

00:27:46.728 --> 00:27:49.022
Yeah, reporters keep swarming the place.

00:27:49.106 --> 00:27:50.941
I was worried they would knock them over.

00:27:52.067 --> 00:27:54.528
I figured I'd move them here
to help Taejoong out.

00:27:55.862 --> 00:27:57.114
Have you visited him yet?

00:28:00.367 --> 00:28:01.576
I'll go see him today.

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.078
Hmm.

00:28:03.161 --> 00:28:04.746
I think it's probably a good idea.

00:28:05.747 --> 00:28:07.207
I'm sure that would comfort him.

00:28:09.876 --> 00:28:10.877
Right.

00:28:14.381 --> 00:28:15.382
[door opens]

00:28:39.322 --> 00:28:41.575
It's all my fault that
you're going through this.

00:28:43.827 --> 00:28:45.037
I'm sorry.

00:28:52.794 --> 00:28:55.255
I still don't understand
why this is happening to me.

00:28:57.716 --> 00:28:58.925
Is that all you have to say?

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:03.430
Anything you want to tell me.

00:29:04.931 --> 00:29:06.016
You can be honest.

00:29:09.436 --> 00:29:10.854
Suji, I...

00:29:11.897 --> 00:29:14.024
I didn't do it. I swear I didn't.

00:29:21.073 --> 00:29:22.157
[exhales]

00:29:25.077 --> 00:29:27.079
[crying] I've been hoping
to hear those words.

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:29.372
[exhales]

00:29:31.208 --> 00:29:33.877
I know you're not the kind
of person who would do that.

00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:35.962
[sniffles]

00:29:40.217 --> 00:29:42.010
I promise I'll be fighting
for you out there.

00:29:42.094 --> 00:29:43.762
So you can't give up in here.

00:29:44.304 --> 00:29:45.305
[exhales shakily]

00:29:50.143 --> 00:29:51.144
[whispers] Suji.

00:29:54.564 --> 00:29:56.483
So you're saying that all we need to do

00:29:56.566 --> 00:29:58.777
is prove that Taejoong
was busy doing something else

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.113
at the exact time of the victim's death?

00:30:01.196 --> 00:30:02.322
That's correct.

00:30:03.073 --> 00:30:04.491
He will need a solid alibi,

00:30:04.574 --> 00:30:06.701
something that will hold up in court.

00:30:06.785 --> 00:30:07.786
Look at this.

00:30:09.996 --> 00:30:13.250
It seems the exact time of death
hasn't been determined yet.

00:30:14.167 --> 00:30:17.087
We'd have to account for his exact
whereabouts during those two days.

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:19.131
That's nearly impossible.

00:30:20.715 --> 00:30:22.926
Sir, please. Is there anything we can do?

00:30:23.009 --> 00:30:24.302
[sighs]

00:30:25.345 --> 00:30:27.514
[Suji] Wait, I think it is possible.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:31.017
When Taejoong works,
he barely takes any breaks.

00:30:31.101 --> 00:30:33.103
It's like he can't waste a single moment.

00:30:33.186 --> 00:30:34.396
[Daehoon] That's true.

00:30:34.479 --> 00:30:36.523
Also, don't they save
all the delivery records?

00:30:36.606 --> 00:30:37.732
You're right.

00:30:37.816 --> 00:30:39.442
-Let's see what we can find.
-Yeah.

00:30:39.526 --> 00:30:41.361
We'll look into it and let you know.

00:30:41.444 --> 00:30:43.363
-Don't worry too much, okay?
-See ya.

00:30:50.996 --> 00:30:53.373
You keep denying the allegations
in the police reports.

00:30:53.456 --> 00:30:55.625
-You positive you want to stick with that?
-[exhales]

00:30:57.544 --> 00:30:58.712
Why do you think I'm lying?

00:30:59.462 --> 00:31:01.089
-What?
-Please, sir.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:04.301
I don't understand
why I'm being forced to go to trial

00:31:04.384 --> 00:31:05.552
for something I didn't do.

00:31:07.429 --> 00:31:09.931
But I'll do everything I can
to prove my innocence.

00:31:12.309 --> 00:31:13.310
[muttering indistinctly]

00:31:13.393 --> 00:31:14.603
Post-its.

00:31:14.686 --> 00:31:15.979
-And photos. Maps.
-Right.

00:31:16.062 --> 00:31:17.564
-Anything that'll help.
-Yeah, sounds good.

00:31:17.647 --> 00:31:19.900
-Okay, come on. And receipts.
-Got it.

00:31:19.983 --> 00:31:20.984
[Daehoon] Okay.

00:31:21.067 --> 00:31:24.070
From 8:00 a.m. on the 20th
to 10:00 p.m. the following night.

00:31:24.154 --> 00:31:26.489
That's right. Would it be possible
to email me those records?

00:31:27.199 --> 00:31:29.201
Everything, if that's all right.

00:31:29.284 --> 00:31:31.661
Well, between noon
and three o'clock, I was...

00:31:31.745 --> 00:31:32.787
in Yeonmi-dong.

00:31:32.871 --> 00:31:35.415
Dowon Food, Maria Pizza, Byeol Coffee.

00:31:35.498 --> 00:31:36.750
Oh, and the receipts,

00:31:36.833 --> 00:31:38.793
I store all of them
in one of my kitchen drawers,

00:31:38.877 --> 00:31:40.629
-just in case I need them.
-I'll find them.

00:31:40.712 --> 00:31:42.464
-[Jeongsu] Receipts? Put 'em here.
-Yeah.

00:31:42.547 --> 00:31:44.799
Good thing Taejoong
saved these in his kitchen drawer.

00:31:44.883 --> 00:31:45.884
[Daehoon] Whoa, dude.

00:31:45.967 --> 00:31:47.219
[Woojong] How should we sort them?

00:31:47.302 --> 00:31:48.845
-[Jeongsu] Let's do it by time slots.
-Okay.

00:31:48.929 --> 00:31:49.930
I'll take ones at lunchtime.

00:31:50.013 --> 00:31:51.348
[Taejin] Another one for dinner.

00:31:51.431 --> 00:31:53.516
-Oh, wait. This one's lunch.
-Set it here.

00:31:54.309 --> 00:31:55.685
[Taejin] What about this?

00:31:55.769 --> 00:31:58.313
Hello, sir. By any chance,
do you know this guy?

00:31:58.396 --> 00:31:59.397
Yeah, I do.

00:31:59.481 --> 00:32:01.274
Do you have receipts
from when Taejoong covered...

00:32:01.358 --> 00:32:03.026
-Thank you so much.
-Yeah, no worries.

00:32:03.109 --> 00:32:04.110
-You get it?
-Yeah.

00:32:04.194 --> 00:32:05.695
-Nice. Good work.
-Found one.

00:32:05.779 --> 00:32:06.780
PETITION

00:32:06.863 --> 00:32:08.490
I appreciate you taking
the time to sign this.

00:32:08.573 --> 00:32:10.617
I was so shocked
when I first heard the news.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.536
-It's the least I could do for him.
-Thank you so much.

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:14.704
[Daehoon] I couldn't find any.

00:32:14.788 --> 00:32:15.997
[Jeongsu] What was the time slot?

00:32:16.081 --> 00:32:17.123
-What about this?
-Papa Bread.

00:32:17.207 --> 00:32:18.250
-Put it here.
-Okay.

00:32:21.211 --> 00:32:23.171
We don't have anything from 2:00 to 2:30.

00:32:23.255 --> 00:32:25.340
-Yeah.
-[chatter continues]

00:32:25.423 --> 00:32:26.424
Nothing in my pile.

00:32:27.425 --> 00:32:29.511
-Strange.
-30 minutes.

00:32:29.594 --> 00:32:31.012
[groans softly]

00:32:31.096 --> 00:32:32.764
Try to remember, Hyung. Think.

00:32:32.847 --> 00:32:34.224
Wait, let me think.

00:32:34.307 --> 00:32:37.143
What was I doing... after the delivery?

00:32:37.978 --> 00:32:39.354
I remember. Okay, so...

00:32:39.437 --> 00:32:40.981
My bike suddenly had a problem.

00:32:41.606 --> 00:32:43.525
So after lunch, I had Kyungho fix it.

00:32:43.608 --> 00:32:44.901
Yeah, that should be it.

00:32:48.196 --> 00:32:49.572
-Look, there he is.
-Right.

00:32:49.656 --> 00:32:50.991
-That's his bike.
-Just like he said.

00:32:51.074 --> 00:32:52.784
Would you mind
if I take a picture of this?

00:32:52.867 --> 00:32:54.244
[laughing]

00:32:54.327 --> 00:32:55.829
A photo is not gonna be enough.

00:32:55.912 --> 00:32:58.290
I'll make you a copy
of the video, all right? Video is better.

00:32:58.373 --> 00:33:00.000
-[all] Thank you so much.
-We appreciate it.

00:33:00.083 --> 00:33:04.838

THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT

00:33:04.921 --> 00:33:06.256
How on earth...

00:33:06.339 --> 00:33:07.966
[chuckles] I can't believe it.

00:33:08.049 --> 00:33:09.384
[chuckles softly]

00:33:10.927 --> 00:33:11.970
This is impressive.

00:33:12.053 --> 00:33:14.848
-[all laughing]
-Man, as we were doing this,

00:33:14.931 --> 00:33:17.642
it made me realize
how insanely hard he was working.

00:33:17.726 --> 00:33:20.020
I don't understand
how he never took a single break.

00:33:23.481 --> 00:33:26.484
With this kind of alibi,
we should be able to put up a good fight.

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:29.779
Actually, I think we can win this.

00:33:30.989 --> 00:33:32.157
[all chuckle in relief]

00:33:38.121 --> 00:33:40.790
Would it be okay for me
to take some of this for the case?

00:33:40.874 --> 00:33:42.334
-Take whatever you need.
-Yes, of course.

00:33:42.417 --> 00:33:43.668
We can bring the rest to you later.

00:33:43.752 --> 00:33:44.753
Yeah.

00:33:45.295 --> 00:33:46.755
[Woojong] We got this.

00:33:47.881 --> 00:33:48.965
[Jeongsu] Great job, everyone.

00:33:49.049 --> 00:33:50.050
[Woojong] Yeah, you too.

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:51.801
[Taejin] Thanks for helping, guys.

00:33:51.885 --> 00:33:53.678
-I mean it.
-[Woojong] Yeah, we got you.

00:33:54.262 --> 00:33:55.764

Why wouldn't you at least
eat a proper meal?

00:34:01.394 --> 00:34:02.896
[sniffles]

00:34:07.734 --> 00:34:09.444
COURT

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:12.947
[bailiff] All rise.

00:34:24.459 --> 00:34:25.668
Please be seated.

00:34:30.965 --> 00:34:35.011
[judge] We will now begin
case number 2020-98374.

00:34:35.095 --> 00:34:39.057
The defendant, Park Taejoong
is being tried on the charges of murder,

00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:42.060
mutilation of a corpse,
and abandonment of a body.

00:34:44.729 --> 00:34:46.314
[lawyer] As you can see, the defendant,

00:34:46.398 --> 00:34:49.692
Park Taejoong, is an ordinary,
functioning member of society.

00:34:50.652 --> 00:34:52.779
I would say he lives a normal life.

00:34:54.114 --> 00:34:56.116
Also, it's clear from the petitions alone

00:34:56.199 --> 00:34:58.952
that he is held in high regard
by those around him.

00:34:59.703 --> 00:35:02.747
Finally, it is obvious when reviewing
the timeline of the defendant,

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:05.500
that contrary to the prosecution's claim,

00:35:05.583 --> 00:35:08.336
it would be impossible for my client
to have committed the crime,

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:10.964
dismember the victim
and dispose of the body.

00:35:12.048 --> 00:35:14.592
This is irrefutable proof
that he is innocent.

00:35:14.676 --> 00:35:15.885
I rest my case.

00:35:15.969 --> 00:35:17.846
[hushed chatter]

00:35:22.183 --> 00:35:23.893
Prosecution, you have the floor.

00:35:25.437 --> 00:35:27.814
Will the defendant please take a seat
at the witness stand?

00:35:33.194 --> 00:35:36.781
WITNESS STAND

00:35:40.827 --> 00:35:44.497
Right. So, similar to the defense,
we also followed the defendant's actions

00:35:44.581 --> 00:35:46.624
and movements on the day of the incident.

00:35:47.709 --> 00:35:50.670
This is the GPS tracking data
of the defendant's whereabouts

00:35:50.754 --> 00:35:52.338
down to the second.

00:35:52.422 --> 00:35:53.923
And, as you can see,

00:35:54.007 --> 00:35:56.259
they match the timeline
presented by the defense.

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:59.304
So I have no objection
to the fact that the defendant

00:35:59.387 --> 00:36:01.264
is a hardworking and sincere person.

00:36:01.347 --> 00:36:03.975
In Article 27 of our Constitution,

00:36:04.058 --> 00:36:05.059
in paragraph four,

00:36:05.143 --> 00:36:08.104
it states that the accused
is innocent until proven guilty,

00:36:08.188 --> 00:36:10.690
and when in doubt,
judgment favors the defendant.

00:36:11.524 --> 00:36:14.903
Personally, I sincerely hope
that Park Taejoong is innocent.

00:36:14.986 --> 00:36:16.863
I truly want to believe that.

00:36:17.697 --> 00:36:19.741
However, there are issues that trouble me.

00:36:19.824 --> 00:36:22.118
And if the defendant
could clear a few things up,

00:36:22.202 --> 00:36:23.495
I'm sure we would all appreciate it.

00:36:23.578 --> 00:36:24.746
Is that all right with you?

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:27.791
Yes.

00:36:30.168 --> 00:36:32.086
Now, here's my first point of concern.

00:36:32.962 --> 00:36:34.005
The records show

00:36:34.088 --> 00:36:37.008
that the defendant made
a delivery to the victim's residence.

00:36:38.927 --> 00:36:42.555
Of course, delivering to the victim's home
could be completely random,

00:36:42.639 --> 00:36:44.682
especially since she lived
in the same district.

00:36:45.225 --> 00:36:47.811
But it's the timeline of it
that confuses me.

00:36:48.561 --> 00:36:51.689
From the time he arrived,
to the time he departed her home,

00:36:51.773 --> 00:36:55.652
the duration of the delivery
was approximately seven minutes in total.

00:36:55.735 --> 00:36:56.945
If you look here,

00:36:57.028 --> 00:36:59.656
it was marked as a contactless delivery
to the third floor.

00:37:01.825 --> 00:37:04.410
But isn't seven minutes
a little long for that?

00:37:09.249 --> 00:37:11.042
[elevator bell dings]

00:37:11.125 --> 00:37:12.293
[panting]

00:37:12.377 --> 00:37:13.545
[camera shutter clicks]

00:37:24.097 --> 00:37:25.348
Well, that's because...

00:37:26.057 --> 00:37:27.267
I had to take care of a tree.

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:28.726
Could you be more specific?

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:30.144
Uh, yes.

00:37:30.228 --> 00:37:32.480
it was a China doll tree.

00:37:32.564 --> 00:37:34.065
It's considered a partial shade plant,

00:37:34.148 --> 00:37:36.234
meaning they shouldn't
get too much sunlight.

00:37:36.317 --> 00:37:39.362
As I was leaving, I saw that
it was placed in front of the window.

00:37:39.445 --> 00:37:42.073
I couldn't help myself,
so I moved it into the shade

00:37:42.156 --> 00:37:43.992
and left some tips for the owner.

00:37:45.285 --> 00:37:48.162
That might be why it took me so long.
I left after that.

00:37:48.246 --> 00:37:49.873
Hmm, I see.

00:37:49.956 --> 00:37:51.124
Understood.

00:37:51.207 --> 00:37:52.625
Moving on to the next question.

00:37:53.668 --> 00:37:55.920
While tracking the defendant's movements,

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:59.132
we found this security footage.

00:37:59.215 --> 00:38:00.675
Could you explain this for us?

00:38:00.758 --> 00:38:02.135
EXHIBIT VIDEO 1) DEFENDANT'S MOVEMENTS

00:38:02.218 --> 00:38:05.013
Excuse me, young man.
Could you lend a hand?

00:38:07.432 --> 00:38:08.683
I was just...

00:38:08.766 --> 00:38:11.102
I finished delivering jokbal
to a customer.

00:38:11.185 --> 00:38:14.105
When I came back, I helped
an old woman with her suitcase.

00:38:14.856 --> 00:38:16.232
So I did what anyone would do

00:38:16.316 --> 00:38:18.276
and helped her
move her things up the hill.

00:38:24.157 --> 00:38:26.826
By any chance... was it this suitcase?

00:38:27.702 --> 00:38:28.786
[Taejoong] Yes, looks like it.

00:38:30.496 --> 00:38:31.915
[prosecutor] That's strange.

00:38:31.998 --> 00:38:33.416
Because this suitcase...

00:38:34.792 --> 00:38:37.962
was found near the location
of where the body was discovered.

00:38:38.046 --> 00:38:39.881
[hushed chatter]

00:38:39.964 --> 00:38:42.216
Forensic analysis confirmed
that this suitcase

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:44.302
was used to transport
the dismembered body.

00:38:44.385 --> 00:38:45.511
Objection.

00:38:45.595 --> 00:38:46.596
Right, I agree.

00:38:47.388 --> 00:38:49.807
Just because the suitcase
appears to be the same model,

00:38:49.891 --> 00:38:52.644
it doesn't prove that it was
the exact one used in the crime.

00:38:52.727 --> 00:38:55.355
Also... we checked all the footage

00:38:55.438 --> 00:38:59.233
and we only found a single video clip
of the defendant with the suitcase.

00:39:00.026 --> 00:39:02.487
He doesn't appear
in any other location besides that.

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:05.531
It's possible, you, unintentionally,
moved through the blind spots.

00:39:05.615 --> 00:39:06.783
The thing is...

00:39:06.866 --> 00:39:09.619
how can someone know
the location of every camera,

00:39:09.702 --> 00:39:12.205
unless they've gone through
these streets hundreds of times?

00:39:12.288 --> 00:39:14.207
[echoing] That would be impossible.

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:16.626
So I actually support
the objection, Your Honor.

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:19.379
Now, why were you
in possession of the victim's phone?

00:39:20.213 --> 00:39:21.506
No, I was...

00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:24.842
The elderly lady asked me
to help carry her things, so I...

00:39:25.635 --> 00:39:26.761
[prosecutor] Mr. Park Taejoong?

00:39:27.512 --> 00:39:29.889
Why was the victim's phone
in your possession?

00:39:32.433 --> 00:39:33.434
The phone? Uh...

00:39:34.477 --> 00:39:36.437
I couldn't have had
the victim's phone, sir.

00:39:37.522 --> 00:39:38.523
Is that right?

00:40:05.299 --> 00:40:06.718
I was... just...

00:40:07.301 --> 00:40:09.887
I was eating... and I heard
the phone ring behind me, so...

00:40:09.971 --> 00:40:13.391
I answered it, and then
I headed out to return it right away.

00:40:16.769 --> 00:40:17.770
Where'd you return it?

00:40:18.896 --> 00:40:20.106
Was it here?

00:40:21.733 --> 00:40:22.734
Yes, that's right.

00:40:23.276 --> 00:40:26.112
And actually,
they offered a reward for it.

CONVENIENCE STORE CCTV

00:40:30.533 --> 00:40:34.203
So who did you return the phone to
if it wasn't the victim?

00:40:35.496 --> 00:40:39.125
And why was her body
less than 40 meters away?

00:40:41.502 --> 00:40:42.879
I don't know, because I never...

00:40:44.422 --> 00:40:46.090
I didn't actually meet her.

00:40:46.174 --> 00:40:48.217
She said she didn't want
a stranger to know where--

00:40:48.301 --> 00:40:49.552
Defendant...

00:40:50.219 --> 00:40:52.305
-Why do you keep lying to me?
-I'm not.

00:40:52.388 --> 00:40:54.891
No, I swear I'm telling you the truth.

00:40:56.642 --> 00:40:57.810
[prosecutor exhales sharply]

00:40:59.812 --> 00:41:01.314
[sighs]

00:41:01.397 --> 00:41:03.941
Now what you see
on the screen are the coordinates

00:41:04.025 --> 00:41:05.860
from the GPS data of the victim's phone.

00:41:06.402 --> 00:41:09.781
They almost match the movements
of the defendant perfectly.

00:41:09.864 --> 00:41:12.033
Do you have some
explanation for this, too?

00:41:12.116 --> 00:41:13.242
Because you just said...

00:41:14.035 --> 00:41:15.203
that you returned it,

00:41:15.286 --> 00:41:17.914
and yet it's obvious
that you had it with you all day.

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:20.416
[sighs in exasperation]

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:23.127
I really don't know
how to explain any of that.

00:41:23.211 --> 00:41:24.295
You don't know?

00:41:24.378 --> 00:41:26.089
Maybe this will jog your memory.

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:29.050
During our investigation,

00:41:29.133 --> 00:41:31.969
we conducted a forensic examination
at the site of the murder.

00:41:32.053 --> 00:41:34.347
But due to the complex
nature of the crimes,

00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:37.225
we did not receive the results
until earlier today.

00:41:37.308 --> 00:41:39.060
[lawyer] Objection!

00:41:39.143 --> 00:41:41.229
This evidence was not disclosed
during discovery.

00:41:41.312 --> 00:41:42.605
Please strike it.

00:41:43.898 --> 00:41:44.941
Overruled.

00:41:45.024 --> 00:41:46.526
-You may proceed.
-Right.

00:41:48.194 --> 00:41:49.195
Mr. Park.

00:41:49.946 --> 00:41:51.447
I still want to be on your side.

00:41:51.531 --> 00:41:53.658
But all the evidence
keeps pointing to you.

00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:59.080

[crowd gasping and murmuring]

00:42:01.958 --> 00:42:05.294
The victim was discovered in the bathroom
of a vacant unit on another floor

00:42:05.378 --> 00:42:07.213
somewhere else in the building.

00:42:07.296 --> 00:42:09.841
Brutally murdered,
then dismembered by the culprit

00:42:09.924 --> 00:42:10.967
with no remorse.

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:13.136
The prosecution believes
that the perpetrator

00:42:13.219 --> 00:42:15.805
placed her lifeless body in warm water

00:42:15.888 --> 00:42:18.349
in order to manipulate the time of death.

00:42:18.432 --> 00:42:21.435
Furthermore, bodily fluids
presumed to belong to the culprit

00:42:21.519 --> 00:42:23.563
were found inside the victim's body.

00:42:23.646 --> 00:42:25.273
[murmuring continues]

00:42:35.783 --> 00:42:37.535
[panicked breathing]

00:42:44.208 --> 00:42:46.085
[prosecutor] If you would be so kind
as to read aloud

00:42:46.169 --> 00:42:48.504
whose semen was identified in the report?

00:42:49.547 --> 00:42:51.048
[hushed chatter]

00:42:59.265 --> 00:43:00.600
This can't...

PARK TAEJOONG, VICTIM'S EVIDENCE SAMPLE

00:43:05.313 --> 00:43:07.690
[prosecutor] You said you spent
seven minutes caring for a plant.

00:43:07.773 --> 00:43:09.984
Sure you weren't filling
the bathtub with warm water?

00:43:10.067 --> 00:43:12.195
It seems like that would have
taken seven minutes.

00:43:12.278 --> 00:43:13.279
[Taejoong] I...

00:43:14.864 --> 00:43:16.699
It... It wasn't me.

00:43:17.783 --> 00:43:19.160
I didn't do it.

00:43:21.204 --> 00:43:22.580
I swear I didn't do it!

00:43:22.663 --> 00:43:23.873
[prosecutor] Mr. Park...

00:43:23.956 --> 00:43:27.543
If you feel even the slightest bit
of guilt toward the victim,

00:43:27.627 --> 00:43:29.754
you could at least tell us why you did it.

00:43:30.338 --> 00:43:32.381
What did she do to deserve
such a horrific death?

00:43:32.465 --> 00:43:34.217
No, Suji. I didn't.

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:36.302
[crowd murmuring]

00:43:38.971 --> 00:43:41.224
Sir, please listen to me. I'm innocent.

00:43:41.307 --> 00:43:43.434
It wasn't me, I swear!

00:43:43.517 --> 00:43:44.936
-I didn't kill her!
-Maintain order.

00:43:45.019 --> 00:43:47.271
-Your Honor, you have to believe me.
-Sit down, defendant.

00:43:47.355 --> 00:43:49.065
It's not me. I didn't do it!

00:43:49.148 --> 00:43:51.567
I... Wait, wait! Let go of me!

00:43:52.401 --> 00:43:54.362
Your Honor, I'm begging you.

00:43:54.445 --> 00:43:56.239
Please, believe me. [whimpers]

00:43:56.322 --> 00:43:58.074
Oh, also...

00:43:58.741 --> 00:43:59.909
That tree that you mentioned...

00:44:00.785 --> 00:44:02.662
We asked the tenants about it,

00:44:02.745 --> 00:44:05.039
and not a single one of them
had ever seen it.

00:44:05.122 --> 00:44:06.958
Perhaps this was just your imagination.

00:44:07.625 --> 00:44:09.335
Your Honor. No, wait.

00:44:09.418 --> 00:44:10.878
I swear I'm telling the truth!

Let go! Wait!

00:44:12.421 --> 00:44:13.589
It's not me!

00:44:13.673 --> 00:44:15.216
I didn't do it.

Taejin is doing his best
to look for a new one,

00:45:00.928 --> 00:45:02.138
but no luck so far.

He said we had a real chance of winning.

is around the corner.

I'm so sorry.

I'm sorry for everything.

What?

Where's the bracelet?

Oh...

-But--
-Where is it?

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:49.226
Where'd it go?

00:45:51.103 --> 00:45:52.730
I'm sorry. I was so out of it, and...

00:45:54.607 --> 00:45:55.858
Why are you bringing that up?

00:45:59.612 --> 00:46:00.613
[crying] Why?

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.701

Trust me.

00:46:14.418 --> 00:46:17.088
I know in my heart that you didn't do it,

00:46:17.963 --> 00:46:20.341
and that you could never do such a thing.

00:46:21.175 --> 00:46:22.259

What are you trying to say?

00:46:31.185 --> 00:46:32.520
The lawyer told us...

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:35.898
that you have to show true remorse

00:46:37.108 --> 00:46:39.068
in order to receive a lighter sentence.

Tell me not to wait for you.

I didn't do it.
