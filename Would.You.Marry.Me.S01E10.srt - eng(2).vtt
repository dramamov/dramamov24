While presenting
the long-term service awards,

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.813
I also counted the number of years
that I've worked here.

00:00:41.897 --> 00:00:46.818
I married into Myungsoondang at 18,
and now I'm 72.

00:00:46.902 --> 00:00:49.154
So, I've worked here for 54 years.

It's nothing to be shocked about.

00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:55.952
Here, at Myungsoondang,

00:00:56.036 --> 00:00:59.915
there's a baker who's been here
one year longer than I have.

00:00:59.998 --> 00:01:04.586
Because of her, even at my age,
I can't be the most senior here.

-Hello?
-Over that long time,

00:01:15.222 --> 00:01:16.640
Myungsoondang has been through...

00:01:16.723 --> 00:01:17.933
[Hangu] That's great to hear.

00:01:18.016 --> 00:01:20.435
I hope to see you soon. Bye.

that doesn't change...

Set up two more seats at the VIP table.
For Beauté Department Store's people.

00:01:29.903 --> 00:01:30.904
Thanks.

[♪ dramatic, whimsical music playing]

00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:35.367
[Philnyun] I learned
from my late mother-in-law

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.744
the spirit of care and sharing.

00:01:39.204 --> 00:01:40.664
[Miyeon] Hey, Jingyeong.

00:01:40.747 --> 00:01:43.750
You're getting prettier by the day.

00:01:44.418 --> 00:01:46.711
Are you seeing anyone these days?

00:01:46.795 --> 00:01:47.963
Gosh, no.

00:01:48.046 --> 00:01:49.256
What a coincidence.

00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:51.883
-Eungsoo is also single.
-Mom, stop it.

00:01:53.468 --> 00:01:56.471
There's no need to look far
when the right one might be close by.

00:01:56.555 --> 00:01:58.348
-Right?
-[Eungsoo mumbles, chuckles]

00:01:58.432 --> 00:02:01.268
[Miyeon chuckles]
There really is no need to look far.

00:02:01.351 --> 00:02:02.769
[Eungsoo] Mom, stop it.

00:02:03.186 --> 00:02:04.187
Seriously.

00:02:04.271 --> 00:02:05.272
[Miyeon] Okay, fine.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:06.731
Yes, sir.

00:02:07.315 --> 00:02:10.444
I think I can secure a unit
for the mayor of Yongdu soon.

00:02:10.902 --> 00:02:14.781
I may be able to retrieve the house
that was lost through the raffle.

Thank you so much for coming.

00:02:35.177 --> 00:02:36.845
Come on in.

00:02:36.928 --> 00:02:38.346
Mr. Kim.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.182
What's your relationship with Ms. Yoo?

[♪ dramatic sting]

00:02:43.226 --> 00:02:45.479
Are you two really married?

[♪ tense, dramatic music playing]

00:02:47.522 --> 00:02:48.982
Well, the thing is...

[gulps]

00:02:53.445 --> 00:02:54.488
[Jingyeong] Mr. Baek?

00:02:57.991 --> 00:03:00.327
I thought it might be you.

00:03:01.912 --> 00:03:03.163
What brings you here?

00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:05.582
[Jingyeong] Oh, I'm here on business.

00:03:06.124 --> 00:03:08.418
I have something to tell you.
Do you have time now?

00:03:13.381 --> 00:03:15.383
This is a bit urgent.

00:03:20.806 --> 00:03:22.140
Excuse us, Wooju.

00:03:22.224 --> 00:03:23.266
Sure.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.643
Shall we?

00:03:38.281 --> 00:03:39.282

[♪ music crescendos, fades]

The two of them

00:03:52.796 --> 00:03:53.838
aren't married.

00:03:55.757 --> 00:03:57.634
Why are you looking so shocked?

00:03:57.717 --> 00:03:59.052
You overheard everything.

00:04:09.312 --> 00:04:11.022
[Philnyun] I was hoping to speak with you.

00:04:11.731 --> 00:04:14.859
Are you personally close to my Wooju?

00:04:15.735 --> 00:04:16.820
[hesitates]

00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:19.281
Yes.

00:04:19.364 --> 00:04:22.200
[Philnyun] Team Manager Kim Wooju
is my grandson. You know that, right?

00:04:22.284 --> 00:04:23.618
Yes, I know.

00:04:25.996 --> 00:04:27.414
You knew?

00:04:27.497 --> 00:04:28.874
Well...

00:04:30.917 --> 00:04:32.794
I know Wooju very well.

00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:36.840
Is Mr. Kim the man...

00:04:36.923 --> 00:04:37.966
That's right.

00:04:38.049 --> 00:04:40.176
He's the guy I told you
I had feelings for.

00:04:43.638 --> 00:04:45.265
What are you going to do now?

00:04:47.893 --> 00:04:50.854
If not married, the prize will be revoked.

00:04:50.937 --> 00:04:53.982
Also, they'll have to take
legal responsibility.

00:04:54.566 --> 00:04:56.776
[sighs softly] Is that so?

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:00.697
I'm left with no choice, then.

00:05:01.156 --> 00:05:03.617
I have no choice but to reveal

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.702
what that house is going to be used for.

00:05:05.785 --> 00:05:08.872
Coincidentally, I also heard something.

00:05:12.334 --> 00:05:13.752
[♪ dramatic sting]

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:20.425
[Jingyeong] Thank you for lending me
some clothes last time.

00:05:20.967 --> 00:05:22.886
I'm leaving them in front of your house.

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:24.471
From Yoon Jingyeong.

Give me a unit at Beauté Palace,

and you won't have to worry
about the permit for the new store.

It's all about helping each other.

00:06:03.468 --> 00:06:05.637
Of course, thank you
for looking out for me.

[♪ tense, suspenseful music playing]

00:06:19.484 --> 00:06:21.528
[Jingyeong] I had my windows open
at the time,

00:06:22.487 --> 00:06:24.698
so the conversation
was recorded on my dash cam.

00:06:24.781 --> 00:06:26.449
I downloaded it to my phone.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:28.576
Are you blackmailing me?

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.495
I'm merely suggesting a deal.

00:06:31.413 --> 00:06:33.206
I get to protect my man.

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:37.085
And you, Director, get to protect
whatever you need to protect.

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:39.546
So, let's help each other.

Retrieving the prize?

00:06:57.272 --> 00:06:58.606
Oh, that.

00:06:59.232 --> 00:07:01.234
Even if you reveal their fake marriage,

00:07:01.317 --> 00:07:02.986
isn't it a bigger deal for you

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:04.946
if people found out about the bribe?

00:07:05.572 --> 00:07:07.073

to listen to your crap?

By the way, was it David?

The one who worked at the Kaltz.

00:07:28.386 --> 00:07:29.637
Your acquaintance.

00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:30.722
Yes.

He's a total nutcase.

00:07:33.641 --> 00:07:36.019

You must be mistaken.

No, I'm sure.

00:08:04.464 --> 00:08:07.717
He said on the flight
that he quit the Kaltz Hotel.

I'm not sure.

00:08:25.985 --> 00:08:27.821
He suddenly asked
if we were indeed married.

00:08:27.904 --> 00:08:29.906
But then, Jingyeong showed up.

00:08:29.989 --> 00:08:32.325
And I haven't heard from him since.

00:08:32.408 --> 00:08:33.868
I wonder what that was about.

00:08:34.494 --> 00:08:35.495
Wait.

00:08:35.578 --> 00:08:37.705
Do Mr. Baek and Jingyeong know each other?

00:08:38.414 --> 00:08:40.124
Apparently, they're in the same club.

00:08:40.208 --> 00:08:41.960
But I didn't know this until today.

00:08:42.961 --> 00:08:43.962
We'll be okay, right?

00:08:44.045 --> 00:08:45.505
We'll be okay.

00:08:45.922 --> 00:08:49.926
Even if he had his doubts,
Jingyeong would've handled it well.

a nuisance to Jingyeong.

to introduce you to my grandma today.

I'll set up an appointment
tomorrow at the office.

Oh, and we can meet
with Mr. Baek in the evening.

00:09:07.318 --> 00:09:10.155
I'm nervous
now that I'm actually about to do this.

When did you get back from the US?

00:10:38.993 --> 00:10:41.371
I came back last weekend.

00:10:41.454 --> 00:10:43.748
After staying in Yeosu for three days,

00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:47.794
I realized
that I don't get along with Mom.

00:10:48.586 --> 00:10:51.464
I have to get a job in Seoul, anyway.

00:10:51.547 --> 00:10:53.841
So, I was thinking
about staying at your house.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.885
I heard about the prize from Mom...

00:11:14.445 --> 00:11:15.488
Hello.

00:11:16.072 --> 00:11:17.073
[Sori in Korean] Who's that?

00:11:17.573 --> 00:11:18.783
[Youngsook] What do you mean?

00:11:18.866 --> 00:11:20.910
It's Wooju, Kim Wooju.

00:11:20.994 --> 00:11:22.787
You're Kim Wooju, right?

00:11:23.246 --> 00:11:25.999
Yes, nice to meet you.
[chuckles sheepishly]

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.339
[clears throat]

00:11:33.423 --> 00:11:34.507
Pass.

00:11:35.258 --> 00:11:37.260
-Pardon?
-Who are you to give him a pass?

00:11:37.343 --> 00:11:38.636
Gosh, you.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.680
Aren't you lucky this year?

00:11:41.806 --> 00:11:44.600
My girl here may not be sweet,
but she is genuine.

00:11:44.684 --> 00:11:46.561
So, please treat her well.

00:11:46.644 --> 00:11:47.687
Cut it out.

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:48.896
Just be quiet.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.148
You be quiet.

00:11:50.231 --> 00:11:52.400
Or I'll tell him all about your temper.

00:11:53.192 --> 00:11:54.944
-[chuckles nervously]
-[Kim Wooju chuckles softly]

00:11:55.028 --> 00:11:57.947
I'll get going now
since your sister is here.

00:11:58.031 --> 00:11:59.240
[Sori] No, stay.

00:11:59.324 --> 00:12:01.826
Don't worry about me
and continue what you were doing.

00:12:02.744 --> 00:12:05.913
I'll quietly find myself
a spare room and sleep.

00:12:05.997 --> 00:12:08.333
I was on my way out, anyway.
[chuckles sheepishly]

00:12:08.416 --> 00:12:09.417
[Sori] Oh, gosh.

00:12:10.626 --> 00:12:12.086
I don't think you were.

00:12:13.171 --> 00:12:14.172
Right there.

00:12:14.797 --> 00:12:16.883
Your lips are telling me the truth.

00:12:16.966 --> 00:12:18.051
What?

[Sori] Oh, my.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.318
Is the air conditioning really on?

00:12:35.902 --> 00:12:37.904
It feels a little heated in here.

00:12:37.987 --> 00:12:39.572
It's so hot.

00:12:45.411 --> 00:12:47.580
Geez, what's with her?

00:12:47.663 --> 00:12:49.624
You must be flustered. I'm sorry.

00:12:49.707 --> 00:12:51.459
Not at all, that was very cute of her.

00:12:52.043 --> 00:12:54.587
But I don't think she's very keen on me.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.255
What do you mean?

00:12:56.339 --> 00:12:57.882
Don't worry about her.

00:12:57.965 --> 00:13:00.093
Tell her that I'll treat her
to a good meal.

00:13:00.176 --> 00:13:01.177
I should win some points.

00:13:02.178 --> 00:13:03.179

Ma'am, it's Hangu.

00:14:35.771 --> 00:14:37.940
I have something important to tell you.

00:14:38.024 --> 00:14:39.025
What?

00:14:39.108 --> 00:14:40.193
The Kaltz Hotel said

00:14:40.276 --> 00:14:42.320
they've never had a contract with us.

00:14:43.029 --> 00:14:45.031
Nor have they ever reviewed a contract.

00:14:45.948 --> 00:14:48.784
I think we've been deceived
by Director David Lee.

00:14:48.868 --> 00:14:50.411
What do you mean?

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.246
That contract was signed long ago!

00:14:53.164 --> 00:14:54.665
Call David now.

00:14:54.749 --> 00:14:57.043
No, I'll go to the US myself.

00:14:57.126 --> 00:14:59.253
I need to meet
with the CEO of Kaltz Hotel.

00:14:59.879 --> 00:15:01.464

[♪ music crescendos, fades]

Meeting the Kaltz Hotel people
wouldn't do any good.

00:16:01.315 --> 00:16:03.901
Because David was fired two years ago,

00:16:03.985 --> 00:16:06.404
they'll say
it's got nothing to do with them.

00:16:07.071 --> 00:16:08.781
[wheezing]

00:16:08.864 --> 00:16:09.991
Then?

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.952
Are you telling me
to just stand by and watch?

00:16:13.786 --> 00:16:15.579
What about the plant in the US

00:16:16.414 --> 00:16:18.874
that cost us a fortune to build?

00:16:23.004 --> 00:16:24.922
You don't have to worry about that.

00:16:25.631 --> 00:16:28.050
The factory built
to supply the Kaltz Hotel...

00:16:30.678 --> 00:16:31.679
was fake.

[♪ unsettling, tense music playing]

We just rented an abandoned building
and did some simple Photoshop work.

We never purchased the land.

00:16:45.735 --> 00:16:46.736
It was...

00:16:48.612 --> 00:16:49.989
all fake?

00:16:51.907 --> 00:16:52.950
Then,

00:16:54.076 --> 00:16:55.995
what about the money we've wired?

00:16:56.078 --> 00:16:58.998
If you've seen Mr. Ko's report,
you should've known

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.667
that the money was siphoned off.

00:17:03.919 --> 00:17:07.673
Through J Consulting,
that money is now in my pocket.

00:17:09.342 --> 00:17:12.428
J Consulting is my company.

00:17:15.765 --> 00:17:16.974

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:24.190
I had my doubts, but...

00:17:26.442 --> 00:17:27.526
Then, [sniffles]

00:17:28.235 --> 00:17:32.740
since David was introduced to us
through J Consulting,

00:17:34.116 --> 00:17:36.160
is the fake contract

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:38.829
also your doing?

00:17:40.915 --> 00:17:41.916
That's right.

00:17:43.042 --> 00:17:44.835
Why would you do that?

00:17:45.795 --> 00:17:49.799
How are you going to face
Miyeon and Eungsoo?

00:17:50.174 --> 00:17:52.635

I don't think I'll need to see them again.

[laughs smugly]

00:17:54.762 --> 00:17:57.640
You should've just given me
a section of the company.

After dumping your
pathetic daughter on me,

00:17:59.892 --> 00:18:02.186
have you had no conscience?
[clicks tongue]

[Hangu] You'll lose
your consciousness soon.

Because of your chronic illness,
it'll be ruled as a natural death.

Well, maybe it's for the best.

you gave your life to

at this point,
there's very little chance she'll wake up.

00:33:58.391 --> 00:33:59.851
In my opinion,

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:03.521
compared to your boss,
the one who pretended to be ill,

00:34:03.605 --> 00:34:07.108
you're a hundred,
a thousand times smarter.

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:10.487
So, you don't need
to keep putting up with it.

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:11.821
Actually,

00:34:12.572 --> 00:34:13.823

Article 8, Clause 3.

00:35:10.797 --> 00:35:13.258
Instead of paying the penalty for breach,

00:35:13.842 --> 00:35:16.553
it says BQ Capital can take part
in management.

00:35:16.636 --> 00:35:18.555
That's the clause you should point out.

00:35:18.638 --> 00:35:22.142
So, the justification is
to speed up the investment rounds?

00:35:22.225 --> 00:35:24.185
With the penalty,
it's about 60 billion won.

00:35:24.269 --> 00:35:26.479
That's about a 35-percent stake.

00:35:26.563 --> 00:35:28.022
With that, we can change bylaws,

00:35:28.106 --> 00:35:30.775
appoint directors,
or approve mergers and acquisitions.

00:35:32.444 --> 00:35:35.864
Once we take management control,
I'm going to sell the company in pieces.

00:35:37.741 --> 00:35:38.742

I feel like people will just talk

I just texted them that I'm stepping down

00:37:13.044 --> 00:37:15.171

You should move while you're still young.

Once you're older,
not many places will hire you.

00:37:49.163 --> 00:37:53.459
[Ms. Oh] Of course, there will be layoffs
once the ownership changes.

You should be looking for a job now.

You haven't worked for five years.

Let's all put our heads together
and find a solution.

00:44:51.002 --> 00:44:52.461
Of course.

00:44:52.545 --> 00:44:54.880
These are our team leaders
joining us today.

00:44:54.964 --> 00:44:56.590
They're the chairwoman's grandsons.

00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:59.760
I'm Sylvia Oh, the CEO of BQ Capital.

[clicks tongue, scoffs]

00:45:32.084 --> 00:45:33.794
I think you're mistaken.

00:45:35.046 --> 00:45:37.006
We're not running a charity.

00:45:37.089 --> 00:45:38.174
We're investors.

00:45:38.257 --> 00:45:39.300
However,

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.803
from factory workers
to delivery drivers and café staff.

00:45:42.887 --> 00:45:45.014
They're all full-time employees
at Myungsoondang.

00:45:45.097 --> 00:45:46.849
-So, layoffs can't be--
-If you can't,

[Eungsoo] Ma'am.

[chuckles softly]
Please don't be so harsh.

00:45:54.774 --> 00:45:58.027
If you could give us a little time,
we'll come up with a solution.

[Jessica chuckles softly]

Sales are tanking
with public opinion turning sour,

00:46:02.865 --> 00:46:05.242
and your assets
are all tied up in real estate.

00:46:05.326 --> 00:46:07.620
I also heard you can't
get any extra loans.

00:46:08.371 --> 00:46:09.705
Isn't that right?

00:46:09.789 --> 00:46:11.165
So, what can you do?

00:46:13.042 --> 00:46:15.169
If you want to recover
at least the investment,

00:46:15.252 --> 00:46:17.380
you'll even have to sell
the company in pieces.

00:46:18.964 --> 00:46:20.007
Is that what you want?

00:46:20.091 --> 00:46:21.133

Okay.

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:36.774
We'll first discuss among ourselves
regarding your requests.

00:46:45.324 --> 00:46:47.493
How could you be so emotional?

00:46:47.576 --> 00:46:49.620
Nothing good will come from crossing her.

00:46:51.288 --> 00:46:52.415
But...

00:46:53.666 --> 00:46:55.918
[Meri] Let's see how your uncle reacts.

00:46:56.377 --> 00:46:58.212
Then we can plan our strategy.

00:46:59.588 --> 00:47:00.631
I'm sorry.

00:47:01.257 --> 00:47:02.508
It was too unreasonable.

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.052
[sighs] I know.

00:47:05.511 --> 00:47:07.471
But this isn't the time for it.

00:47:07.555 --> 00:47:08.806
Then,

00:47:09.849 --> 00:47:11.267
what do you think we should do?

00:47:12.601 --> 00:47:13.602
[sighs]

00:47:14.937 --> 00:47:17.064
We'll just have to give in to her demands.

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:20.443
We should start
by laying off all management levels,

00:47:20.526 --> 00:47:22.319
and quickly sell off the factories

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:24.572
and other real estate to secure cash.

00:47:25.823 --> 00:47:27.074
It'll be quite a loss, but...

00:47:38.419 --> 00:47:39.670
It's as we expected.

00:47:40.921 --> 00:47:42.465
They pretended to be strangers.

00:47:42.965 --> 00:47:44.550
They're trying to sell it off dirt cheap

00:47:44.633 --> 00:47:46.302
and turn it into an empty shell.

00:47:47.094 --> 00:47:50.014
Then they'll sell
the proprietary technology and the brand.

00:47:50.473 --> 00:47:51.515
This is frustrating.

00:47:51.599 --> 00:47:53.392
Can't we just expose them?

00:47:53.476 --> 00:47:55.603
Let everyone know about their affair

00:47:55.686 --> 00:47:57.104
and their plan for take over.

00:47:57.188 --> 00:48:00.774
But adultery can't be used
as decisive evidence.

00:48:01.484 --> 00:48:04.778
We need concrete proof
that they conspired to commit fraud.

00:48:05.863 --> 00:48:08.991
We can't access their phones or accounts
by reporting their adultery.

00:48:09.074 --> 00:48:11.410
And if they insist
they're unrelated work-wise,

00:48:11.494 --> 00:48:12.786
it won't get us anywhere.

00:55:37.731 --> 00:55:39.733
in an attempt to drug her.

[reporter 1] With the forged contract,

00:55:41.276 --> 00:55:43.695
Myungsoondang was accused
of investment fraud.

00:55:43.779 --> 00:55:45.113
But the police has confirmed

00:55:45.197 --> 00:55:47.282
that Myungsoondang
was essentially the victim.

00:55:47.366 --> 00:55:49.743
[reporter 2] Police found evidence
from Ms. Oh's phone and emails

00:55:49.826 --> 00:55:53.455
indicating that she conspired
with a former executive of the Kaltz Hotel

00:55:53.538 --> 00:55:55.999
to forge the contract
and carry out the fraud.

00:55:56.083 --> 00:55:58.085
The police are now
cooperating with Interpol...

00:55:58.168 --> 00:56:00.504
I've told them already.

00:56:00.587 --> 00:56:03.131
I told them the chairwoman
would never do such a thing.

00:56:03.215 --> 00:56:05.801
But young people these days
aren't loyal to the company.

00:56:05.884 --> 00:56:08.220
They tried to send in resumes
to other companies,

00:56:08.303 --> 00:56:09.471
so I gave them an earful.

00:56:10.013 --> 00:56:13.892
I told them they shouldn't be
so disloyal to the company.

When did they get here?

00:56:20.607 --> 00:56:21.692
Ms. Oh...

00:56:22.401 --> 00:56:23.902
What a traitor.

00:56:23.985 --> 00:56:26.488

-We can do this!

00:56:26.571 --> 00:56:28.323
Let's work hard. Let's go!

Thank you, all of you.

For believing in the company.

00:56:39.918 --> 00:56:43.171
I think we were able to get through
this crisis thanks to you.

I'm sure you had it the toughest, Mr. Kim.

What's happening now, then?

00:56:50.011 --> 00:56:52.973
I heard a rumor
that Director Jang was involved.

Sejung, I told you that was a secret.

00:56:57.310 --> 00:56:58.395
[whispers] Was it a secret?

00:56:58.478 --> 00:56:59.896
[Wonseok whispers] Didn't I tell you?

JUNGMUN POLICE STATION, DETECTIVE PARK

00:57:08.864 --> 00:57:10.949
[Det. Park] From the forensic analysis
of Ms. Oh's phone,

00:57:11.032 --> 00:57:13.326
we found evidence
that she conspired with David.

00:57:14.661 --> 00:57:18.165
But there were no personal texts
between her and Mr. Jang Hangu.

00:57:18.582 --> 00:57:21.084
There were also
no transactions to Mr. Jang's account.

00:57:22.169 --> 00:57:23.170
Really?

00:57:24.588 --> 00:57:26.715
She doesn't know anyone in Seoul,

00:57:26.798 --> 00:57:28.467
I had no choice but to come.

00:57:32.596 --> 00:57:34.055
[sighs, clicks tongue]

Eat slowly.

00:57:38.185 --> 00:57:39.269
Okay.

Fine.

00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:57.370

00:58:05.754 --> 00:58:09.549
I asked a restaurant manager
I used to work with to look after him.

00:58:10.509 --> 00:58:12.844
I only asked her
to help me out for a few days.

00:58:12.928 --> 00:58:14.429
So, please look after Henry.

00:58:14.513 --> 00:58:15.931
Don't worry.

00:58:17.432 --> 00:58:19.935
You deleted all the records
from the server, right?

00:58:21.269 --> 00:58:22.270
Yes.

00:58:23.271 --> 00:58:26.066
I also got rid of the phone
that I used to contact you.

You did great. [chuckles]

Someone's got to look after Henry.

What did the lawyer say?

00:58:34.324 --> 00:58:36.785
They said you'll get about 15 years.

00:58:36.868 --> 00:58:39.746
But I'll use the best lawyer
to get you out as soon as possible.

00:58:43.875 --> 00:58:47.462
All you need to do is just remain silent.

00:58:48.255 --> 00:58:49.422
You'll get a divorce

00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:53.093

I know of your relationship.

00:59:41.433 --> 00:59:42.517
That you lied to us

00:59:42.601 --> 00:59:45.312
to embezzle company funds
through J Consulting.

00:59:46.521 --> 00:59:47.522

that you've conspired
with Ms. Oh Minjeong.

I had no choice.

01:00:08.251 --> 01:00:10.503
I was being dragged around by her threats.

01:00:10.587 --> 01:00:13.590
She said she wouldn't just sit back
if I didn't get the money.

01:00:13.673 --> 01:00:16.635
She also said the child is mine,
but I'm not really sure.

Aside from the private contract
with J Consulting,

01:00:26.561 --> 01:00:29.314
I had nothing to do with BQ Capital.

I saw Dad secretly being
on the phone in the car.

He was on the phone
every night in secret for hours.

Even without killing her,

01:02:48.161 --> 01:02:50.705
you could legally take over Myungsoondang.

01:07:09.505 --> 01:07:10.923
Just trust me.

01:07:11.007 --> 01:07:12.759
Everything will go as planned.

01:07:15.345 --> 01:07:17.305
THEY JUST LEFT
PLATE NUMBER SEOUL 10 NI 3309

01:07:21.142 --> 01:07:22.185
They just left.

01:07:22.268 --> 01:07:24.604
25 YEARS AGO

01:07:24.687 --> 01:07:28.983
The plate number is Seoul 10 Ni 3309.

01:07:34.113 --> 01:07:35.156
[Miyeon] Honey.

01:07:36.908 --> 01:07:37.992
What are you doing?

01:07:38.076 --> 01:07:39.327
Come have some fruit.

01:07:39.410 --> 01:07:40.620
Okay, I'm on my way.

01:07:40.703 --> 01:07:41.996
[both chuckle]

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:43.373
I looked everywhere for you.

01:07:45.792 --> 01:07:47.502
THEY JUST LEFT
PLATE: SEOUL 10 NI 3309

01:07:47.585 --> 01:07:49.045
[♪ tense, foreboding music continues]

01:07:52.298 --> 01:07:53.508
UNDER CONSTRUCTION
NO ENTRY

01:07:53.591 --> 01:07:54.801
NO ENTRY

01:08:02.892 --> 01:08:05.061
-There must be a construction site.
-I guess so.

01:08:06.813 --> 01:08:08.523
SEOUL 10 NI 3309

01:08:19.033 --> 01:08:20.451
Are you still upset, Wooju?

01:08:20.535 --> 01:08:24.956
It was my birthday present.
Why did you give it to Eungsoo?

01:08:25.039 --> 01:08:26.749
It was mine.

01:08:26.833 --> 01:08:29.043
He wanted it.

01:08:29.127 --> 01:08:31.838
His whole family came
to wish you a happy birthday.

01:08:31.921 --> 01:08:34.006
-Couldn't you give him that?
-No.

01:08:34.882 --> 01:08:37.969
He always takes what's mine.

01:08:38.594 --> 01:08:40.263
He's a mean pig.

01:08:40.346 --> 01:08:43.182
You can't talk like that
about your cousin.

01:08:43.266 --> 01:08:44.559
Take it back.

01:08:53.276 --> 01:08:54.735
Or Dad will get really angry.

01:08:55.194 --> 01:08:56.279
You won't take it back?

01:08:58.656 --> 01:09:01.659
You're a good boy, aren't you?
Do as your dad says.

01:09:02.785 --> 01:09:03.786
[exclaims]

01:09:04.537 --> 01:09:05.746
You won't take it back?

01:09:06.622 --> 01:09:07.999
[Kim Wooju's dad sighs]

01:09:08.291 --> 01:09:11.919
Then I won't buy you the toy robot.

01:09:19.802 --> 01:09:20.845
[gasps] Honey!

01:09:20.928 --> 01:09:22.138

01:09:23.306 --> 01:09:24.974

01:09:39.489 --> 01:09:40.907
[♪ ominous music playing]

01:09:51.542 --> 01:09:53.794
I TOOK CARE OF IT

01:09:58.966 --> 01:10:00.843
[exclaims smugly] This was it.

01:10:11.437 --> 01:10:12.605
-[sighs softly]
-[laptop chimes]

01:10:14.106 --> 01:10:16.359
PHONE RECORDINGS

01:10:16.442 --> 01:10:17.902
[♪ music increases in tempo]

01:10:29.121 --> 01:10:32.124
[Jessica] The president
found out about us.

01:10:32.583 --> 01:10:33.626
What do we do?

01:10:33.709 --> 01:10:35.044
[Hangu] We need to get rid of him.

01:10:35.127 --> 01:10:36.128
[Jessica] What?

01:10:36.212 --> 01:10:38.506
[Hangu] There's a family gathering
in Yeosu next week.

01:10:38.589 --> 01:10:41.676
That's when we'll have to get it done.

01:10:53.187 --> 01:10:54.188
[whistling tune]

01:10:55.106 --> 01:10:56.440
[♪ dramatic sting]

01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:18.838
Was it you, Uncle?

01:11:22.758 --> 01:11:23.759
Tell me.

01:11:25.928 --> 01:11:27.138
Was it you?

01:11:27.221 --> 01:11:28.598
[♪ tense, foreboding music playing]

01:11:37.732 --> 01:11:38.816

01:11:47.283 --> 01:11:49.911
THANKS TO KIM MINSANG
FOR THE SPECIAL APPEARANCE

01:12:05.384 --> 01:12:08.054
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

01:12:08.137 --> 01:12:09.680
[Kim Wooju] He asked me for forgiveness,

01:12:09.764 --> 01:12:10.890
but he killed my parents.

01:12:10.973 --> 01:12:13.017
[judge] The nature
of the crime is heinous,

01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:14.685
-and its social harm is substantial.
-[Hangu screaming]

01:12:14.769 --> 01:12:17.480
Accordingly, this court hereby
grants the defendant...

01:12:17.563 --> 01:12:19.106
[Jingyeong] She regained
her consciousness.

01:12:19.190 --> 01:12:20.775
[Meri] Let's meet at home.

01:12:20.858 --> 01:12:24.153
I don't think we can accept
the house that I won through the raffle.

01:12:24.236 --> 01:12:26.697
Well, this really feels
like we're newlyweds.

01:12:26.781 --> 01:12:27.865
[Kim Wooju] We are newlyweds.

01:12:27.949 --> 01:12:29.784
-My heart...
-[Sejung] Let's buy some fruit.

01:12:29.867 --> 01:12:31.577
[Eunsook] Didn't you know
she's a divorcée?

01:12:31.661 --> 01:12:33.955
-[Youngsook] Let's end this together!
-[Wooju's sister] No, stop!

01:12:34.038 --> 01:12:35.247
[Sori screams]

01:12:35.331 --> 01:12:36.624
[Jingyeong] Why don't you call me

01:12:37.124 --> 01:12:38.125
once a week?

01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.211
[Wooju] Just wait.

01:12:40.294 --> 01:12:41.587
I'm still here.

01:12:41.671 --> 01:12:42.964
[Meri] Something happened, Wooju.

01:12:43.047 --> 01:12:44.715
A woman, my current legal wife,

01:12:44.799 --> 01:12:45.841
Yoo Meri.

01:12:45.967 --> 01:12:47.051
[Kim Wooju] What?

01:12:47.134 --> 01:12:48.219
A press conference?

01:12:50.721 --> 01:12:52.723
