=Episode 20=

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.320
My Lady, it's been a long time
since I've seen you cook.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.380
It's rare to have some leisure lately.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.420
My father's condition has improved.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.740
Chang'an and Ruyi make good progress
in their studies.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.590
The Commander has been
working hard recently.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.540
I'll make some flower pastries.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.640
They all love to eat them.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.190
Aunt Ning.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.500
Aunt Ning, something's wrong.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.900
Chang'an, he... he...

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.460
- What's wrong with him?
- He's gone.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.500
What?

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.740
What's going on?

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.760
After school today,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.900
the tutor suddenly called me.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.820
Chang'an was waiting for me
at the gate.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.100
But when I went out, I didn't see him.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.540
I only found this.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.660
Chang'an's jade pendant.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.820
Ruyi, it's OK.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.700
Chang'an must have gotten lost
because he was too playful.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.540
It's OK.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.240
You rest here first.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.580
Wait for us to come back, alright?

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.280
Mm, OK.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.780
It's fine. Hurry up.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.260
Hongmei, I'm feeling really anxious.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.620
I think something must have happened
to Chang'an.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.770
Come with me to look for him.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.670
- Alright.
- Let's go.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.580
(Commander's Mansion)

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.500
A strip of cloth from Chang'an.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.540
My Lady, what does this letter say?

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:04.900
This letter asks me

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.960
to go alone immediately
to the West Garden on Changle Street.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.540
Chang'an is there.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.180
That place is an abandoned residence.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.020
Who would tie Chang'an up there?

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.140
This handwriting is all too familiar.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.980
I just didn't expect

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.380
he could go this far.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.420
Hongmei, I must go there immediately.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.100
You wait here.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.420
My Lady, why not wait the Commander
and go with him?

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.940
No, I'm afraid there's not enough time.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.620
You wait here for the Commander.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.900
Once he returns,

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.300
ask him go to the west immediately.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.940
Understood?

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.020
Alright, I understand.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.880
I'll go first.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.920
My Lady, be careful.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.980
Commander Pei,

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.020
the Prince invites you to gather
at Xiangyue Restaurant tonight.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.020
You tell the Prince

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.480
that I will keep the appointment.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:07.840
Yes.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.740
I will be respectfully waiting
for you there.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.220
Commander, this is a Hongmen Banquet.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.790
Asking you to go there at this time,

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.960
he must harbor bad intentions.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.220
Since it's unclear,

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.700
then let's play along.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.660
Go to the Xiangyue Restaurant.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.660
Yes.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.220
Let's go.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.620
Come out.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.320
Since you ask me to be here,

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.900
let's be honest with each other.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.980
Wanning,

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.180
I hope you've been well.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.220
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.020
I don't know why you arranged

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.060
to meet here.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.340
Heng.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.020
Long time no see.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.100
Where is Chang'an? I want to see him.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.540
Wanning, don't worry.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.300
Chang'an.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.140
He's just asleep.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.340
Chang'an.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.380
Cui Yunfeng,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.340
looks like that beating was too light.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.100
You haven't learned your lesson at all.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.500
Let me remind you.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.480
You and I have nothing to do
with each other.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.660
We have no connection anymore.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.340
Wanning, you are too ruthless.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.340
Why are you bringing up that beating?

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.740
If it weren't for you
forcing me into a corner,

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.720
I wouldn't have resorted
to this last measure.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.220
What exactly are you trying to do?

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.860
Wanning,

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.180
I just want to reconcile with you.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.820
Look at you, me,

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:35.740
and Chang'an,

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.100
how wonderful it is for the three of us

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.660
to be together as a family.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.260
You and I have long been divorced.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.740
I advise you to return the child to me
as soon as possible

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.790
and leave the Capital City.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.580
I can choose not to pursue this matter.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.860
Otherwise,

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.660
it's not something that can be resolved
with just one beating.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.380
Mother.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.100
Father.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.700
I want my father.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.500
Wanning,

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.700
why must you be so heartless?

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:13.780
Listen.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.660
The child is calling me father.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:16.780
Father.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.300
Father.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.060
I am his father.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.060
Wanning,

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.100
I know it was my fault before.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.220
I will definitely mend my ways

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.260
and treat you well.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.620
Come back with me.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.660
Let go, let go.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.810
Today, it was not my father
who invited you here.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.900
It was me.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.820
I still have matters to attend to today.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.780
I will drink with you another day.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.540
It's all my fault.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.860
Why not change your clothes first,

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.180
and then attend to the matters
afterward?

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.180
No wonder Xu Wanning used this trick

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.220
to flirt with the Marquis
at the poetry gathering.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.260
Turns out it's so effective.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.620
If I had known earlier,

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.300
you would have been mine long ago.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.820
I would surely treat you gently.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:46.580
Aphrodisiac?

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.420
Shame on you!

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:54.740
Wanning,

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.080
isn't this exactly the same
as the poetry gathering six years ago?

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.140
We can continue our past fate.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.340
Cui Yunfeng,

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.140
stop putting on an act.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.300
At the poetry gathering six years ago,

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.220
my clothes were soaked by someone,

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.300
so I went to change clothes.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.870
Unfortunately, I was affected
by the aphrodisiac in the room.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.820
The person who lit the incense was you.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.180
But the person back then was not you.

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.100
- How do you know?
- Don't come over.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:27.980
Heng,

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.220
do you truly despise me so much?

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.340
It doesn't matter.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.580
Six years ago, I missed you.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.860
Today, I will not miss you again.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:11.660
(Six years ago)

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.540
(The aphrodisiac has already been lit.)

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.580
(All present are young ladies
from noble families.)

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.380
(Let's see who can become my wife)

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.140
(and help me rise to success.)

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.780
- Long time no see.
- Long time no see.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.260
(I have to find a place to clean up.)

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.620
No problem. I'll go take care of it.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:39.580
Alright.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:43.380
Here. Zhao.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.820
Marquis Cui, you've also come
to the Capital City.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:50.740
It's been a long time.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.140
Come on, let's have another drink.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.100
Zhao, let's talk another day.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.100
Marquis Cui, no way.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.180
It's been a long time.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:15.300
Another drink, another drink.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.620
Let's have another drink.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.220
Alright, then let's have another drink.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.620
Darn it! I actually missed the timing.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.140
She is the daughter of a merchant.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.520
She seems to be acquainted
with the Princess,

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.140
so she arrived at this gathering.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:32.060
Forget it.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.330
Although she's not as good
as those noble ladies,

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.100
she is quite wealthy.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:37.540
It's not bad.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:51.660
Who are you?

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.780
What are you going to do?

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.580
Wanning.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.420
What on earth is going on?

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.420
Your Highness,

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.190
I am Cui Yunfeng
from the Marquis's Mansion.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.020
I lost control
because of the aphrodisiac.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:07.980
So Lady Xu and I...

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:12.900
No matter what,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.660
I am willing to marry Lady Xu
as my wife.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.060
Aphrodisiac?

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:17.860
Wanning,

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.580
is what he said true?

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.620
You stand up first.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:32.020
Your Highness.

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:40.420
In that case, I bestow marriage
upon you.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.340
Wanning is my good friend.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.460
You must treat her well in the future.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.100
Yes, Your Highness.

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.900
Six years ago you deceived me.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.820
That person was not you at all.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.260
So you knew it wasn't me.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.100
Bai Qingqing told me that not long ago.

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.220
You are so vicious.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.100
In order to get our family's wealth,

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.220
you took advantage of the situation
and married me.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.940
In six years after we got married,

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.060
we never consummated our marriage.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:18.940
Wanning,

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.620
at that time,

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.420
I knew that you had been touched
by another man,

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:25.900
so I was unwilling to touch you again.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:31.380
Rest assured. I will definitely
treat you well from now on.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:42.420
Wanning.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:56.420
Are you alright?

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:00.420
Chang'an.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.620
Mother.

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.280
Commander.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.320
Commander, spare my life.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.220
I didn't touch her,

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.620
even a single finger of hers.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.380
Then why did you slander her just now?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.980
Spare my life, Commander.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.450
Six years ago,
it was someone else who touched her.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:19.660
It has nothing to do with me.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.320
I haven't touched her
in these six years.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:21.940
Not even once.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.260
(So to speak,)

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.320
(could it be that Chang'an is...)

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.540
You kidnapped the child

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:29.780
and found a place like this.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.880
This was definitely not done
by you alone.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:32.780
Speak.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:38.620
It's...

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.260
Someone wants to silence him.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:46.580
Xu Wanning,

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.780
you've ruined my plan again.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:50.860
In that case,

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.580
I'll have to deal with you first.

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:02.220
