00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.200
Darker?

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:44.560
You watch this stuff?

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:46.120
You didn't update.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.879
I have to watch this to kill time.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.719
Yang Zhenghui!

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.400
Huang?

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.599
Why are you here?

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.079
Like you've seen a ghost.

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:58.680
I don't want to see you either.

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:02.400
Is this your girlfriend?

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:03.439
Your taste

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:04.439
has changed.

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:05.239
Stop it.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.599
She's just a friend.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.120
Don't worry.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.719
Having a girlfriend

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:10.520
is a good thing.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.919
She's got limited mobility.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.039
Take good care of her.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.360
No offense.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.439
You're offending me.

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:16.879
Can you stop it?

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.360
What are you worried about?

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.360
Why so worried?

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.319
I'm not!

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.080
Don't stay here.

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:21.879
I'm begging you.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.560
Just leave.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.520
Get out of here.

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.840
Fine.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.719
Just go, thanks.

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.319
Don't touch me.

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:26.919
Alright.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.840
I'll leave you alone.

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.520
Wishing you good health.

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:32.199
You!

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.840
Ex-girlfriend?

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.800
The one

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.080
you couldn't find last year?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.520
No.

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:41.919
The one before that.

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:44.000
She doesn't seem

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.280
very friendly toward you.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.840
The breakup was messy.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.680
It was years ago.

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:50.840
I hadn't started making

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.360
videos.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.319
Had no money either.

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:53.639
Even for her birthday,

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:54.919
I had to borrow money

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.879
to buy her gifts.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.000
Then some guy

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.800
pursued her.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.000
He was pretty wealthy.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.680
I found it out

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:00.840
and we had a huge fight.

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:02.879
She cut ties with him.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.000
But soon after,

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.879
she dated

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.759
another guy.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.400
That guy

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:07.400
was married.

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:08.759
She wasn't right for you.

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.000
No need to tolerate her.

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:15.439
Not really.

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:17.719
With my conditions then,

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.199
no girl was right for me.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.120
But

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.400
I later made up my mind

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:28.240
to quit my job

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:30.080
and started making videos.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.840
Are you successful now?

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:33.439
Not yet.

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:34.639
But my income is

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.800
better than before.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.439
I've already

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.360
shared

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.080
my story.

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:42.800
Now

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.599
it's your turn.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.759
I didn't ask you to,

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.680
but you shared it.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.840
I'm just curious

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.319
how your husband managed to

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:49.240
win over a wealthy girl

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.120
like you.

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:51.319
I can tell you,

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.400
but you can't learn it.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.319
Maybe I can.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.439
Try me then.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.000
I need to go to the wet market today.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.000
Go with me.

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:00.800
Maybe I'd tell you on the way.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.719
Let's go.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.520
What?

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.759
You forgot the rules.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.639
Luckily, I kept the clothes

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.719
in the trunk.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.600
Or, I couldn't

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.720
go with you.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.519
You didn't wash

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.240
them?

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.240
I only wore them for one day.
Why would I?

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.199
You men are really something!

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.720
I went on

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.120
a road trip with a friend

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.560
and had a flat tire on the way.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.680
We two girls

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.959
couldn't change the tire.

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:41.120
We called for help

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.759
but they wouldn't arrive for hours.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.040
We were just waiting.

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:45.720
Then we met my husband

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.560
who's taking students for fieldwork.

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:55.319
Great!

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.079
What's wrong?

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.680
My car broke down. The tire is flat.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.120
Spare tire?

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.759
Yes.

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:03.480
In the trunk.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.600
But we don't know how.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.120
No problem.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.920
Here.

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:07.120
Put the sign

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.839
over there.

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:08.199
Okay.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.079
Get the tools and the spare tire.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.839
Let's change it.

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:11.319
Alright.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.480
Thank you so much!

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:40.839
No need. We're passing by.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.519
No big deal.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.944
Professor Zeng, done.

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:43.720
Get in then.

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:44.439
Okay.

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:47.279
You're so young to be a professor.

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:48.879
Just an assistant professor.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.120
Are you taking students on a trip?

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.040
I'm taking them for fieldwork.

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:56.879
Art Department of Caorong University.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.319
Where are you going?

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:59.000
Maybe join us?

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.560
We are just vacationing.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.839
You drive such a nice car,

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.680
probably stay in a boutique hotel.

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:06.199
When we do fieldwork,

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:07.160
usually stay with

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:08.000
locals.

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:09.079
You two city girls

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:10.240
couldn't stand it.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.000
Okay. Enjoy your trip.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.839
I'm leaving.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.480
I'm Zeng Jie.

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:35.000
What car did you drive?

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.480
Cayenne.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.600
Remember what car

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:40.680
that rich lady drove?

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:41.600
Yes, yes.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.759
We circled the car

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:43.759
a few times

00:06:43.959 --> 00:06:45.839
and saw it clearly. A Porsche.

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:48.160
Do you have a Porsche sports car?

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.040
I've never liked sports cars.

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:52.360
I prefer taller vehicles

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:53.199
with better views.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.639
So you and your husband

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:58.079
just started dating then?

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.680
(Zeng Jie's Moments)
Not bad.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.920
He's your type,
dressing decent but wild inside.

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:06.120
What did you say?

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:07.040
Look,

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:08.480
he's an artist.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.319
His Moments is

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:10.480
filled with ceramics.

00:07:11.079 --> 00:07:12.319
I never realized

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.959
ceramics could be so beautiful.

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:15.439
What now?

00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:17.120
You fancy him.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.319
Now you even like

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:19.839
what he likes?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.199
He's talented.

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:22.560
(Zeng Jie's Profile)
He's won awards.

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:23.439
At his age,

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.639
he's already a professor.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.240
Miss Bai,

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.519
make your move now,

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.279
or

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:30.519
other beauties might

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:31.240
beat you to it.

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:32.199
Heard me?

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.319
Stop it. Get in the car.

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:37.160
Soon after my birthday,

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.560
he saw my post

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:39.879
and sent me a gift.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.360
I received a gift,

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:42.399
very special.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.480
Just an ordinary piece of work.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.360
This is a hairpin, right?

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.360
You made this?

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:50.120
Yes.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.240
You have everything.

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:52.959
Designer bags, jewelry.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.959
You've got all that.

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:55.240
So I made

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.759
this thing for you.

00:07:57.439 --> 00:07:58.399
I really like it.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.879
Since childhood,

00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:00.759
no one ever

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.959
made anything for me.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.680
Let alone something this special.

00:08:04.199 --> 00:08:05.439
You even engraved a poem?

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:06.920
What does it say?

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.480
I yearn to send a letter to my beloved.

00:08:10.759 --> 00:08:14.360
But mountains stretch, rivers flow.
I have no idea where my beloved is.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.160
Why can't I

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.000
recognize it?

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.040
In ancient script.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.439
Just knowing the meaning.

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:21.759
What does that mean?

00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:23.959
(I found a poetry.)

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.600
Being young and charming
as plum blossoms.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.480
I wear a flower hairpin,
betrothed to you.

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:31.079
This man is really something.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.959
Perhaps.

00:08:32.639 --> 00:08:34.519
Anyway, I was quite moved,

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.559
thinking he's really thoughtful.

00:08:39.879 --> 00:08:40.679
True.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.320
Whatever he does,

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.320
he's always this thoughtful.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:49.759
Let me tell you.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.039
This fish is so fresh.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.919
All picked this morning.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.480
I fear you wouldn't come today.

00:08:54.639 --> 00:08:55.279
Thanks.

00:08:55.399 --> 00:08:56.080
Take care.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.519
That vendor knows you well.

00:08:58.679 --> 00:09:00.360
You love fish?

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.000
I'm so noticeable.

00:09:02.159 --> 00:09:02.799
Coming twice,

00:09:02.879 --> 00:09:03.960
and they all remember me.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.679
I don't like fish.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.840
But my husband does.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.480
Despite all this,

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:09.519
you still cook at home?

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:10.559
Despite all this,

00:09:10.679 --> 00:09:12.080
I can only cook at home.

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:13.120
Besides,

00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:14.759
I want to do something.

00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:16.919
As usual?

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.080
Pork belly, a bit leaner.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.639
Pork liver and lungs,

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.120
a bit of each.

00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:26.000
You don't seem like eating these.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.519
He likes pork belly.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.399
Liver and lung soup

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.200
are good for him.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.120
He often stays up late.

00:09:30.639 --> 00:09:31.919
You're such a devoted wife.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.200
All done.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.720
Next, let's get some greens?

00:09:37.919 --> 00:09:39.320
What do you like to eat?

00:09:39.639 --> 00:09:40.600
There's

00:09:40.679 --> 00:09:41.519
a supermarket

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:42.440
by the market entrance.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.879
They sell excellent steaks

00:09:43.919 --> 00:09:44.639
and bread.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.559
(Steak)
It's pricey.

00:09:47.759 --> 00:09:49.200
With higher meat grade.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.559
Should I drive you back to café

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.559
or home?

00:09:53.759 --> 00:09:54.440
Home.

00:09:54.879 --> 00:09:56.120
My husband is working late.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.120
Can't pick me up.

00:09:57.559 --> 00:09:58.080
Okay.

00:10:02.759 --> 00:10:04.360
Your husband is really lucky.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.759
You treat him so well.

00:10:06.559 --> 00:10:08.320
What's special about
shopping and cooking?

00:10:08.519 --> 00:10:10.320
Aren't all wives doing so?

00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:11.360
Besides,

00:10:11.559 --> 00:10:12.799
I'm disabled now.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.240
Is it lucky?

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.679
You weren't disabled before.

00:10:15.799 --> 00:10:17.320
And you'll recover.

00:10:24.679 --> 00:10:26.120
Let me take you home.

00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:27.600
No need. It's close enough.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.000
I'll go back myself.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.200
I'm dressed like this.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.480
Don't worry.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.559
I'm not worrying.

00:10:32.919 --> 00:10:34.519
I can go back on my own.

00:10:34.799 --> 00:10:35.919
You've helped me a lot.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:36.519
Thank you.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.399
Alright.

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:38.399
Be careful then.

00:10:38.679 --> 00:10:39.840
Wash the clothes.

00:11:37.799 --> 00:11:38.440
Zeng Jie.

00:11:38.879 --> 00:11:40.360
Before I discharge,

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.960
I want to have a chat with you.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:42.879
Alright.

00:11:43.279 --> 00:11:44.960
I need to confess something

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.519
that

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.960
I did consider divorcing you.

00:11:49.559 --> 00:11:50.159
And now?

00:11:50.759 --> 00:11:51.399
Still want to?

00:11:51.679 --> 00:11:52.559
How about you?

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.600
Master Zeng,

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.879
could you bear having

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.399
a disabled wife?

00:12:02.879 --> 00:12:05.240
Can you tolerate a blemish flaw like me?

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:08.440
The doctors said

00:12:09.679 --> 00:12:11.080
there's a chance you could recover.

00:12:11.759 --> 00:12:13.200
What if I can't?

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.480
Now,

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.360
I couldn't abandon you.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:21.759
Right.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.039
Of course, you can't abandon

00:12:24.159 --> 00:12:25.600
your injured, disabled wife.

00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:26.720
If you did,

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.679
your reputation would suffer.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.399
Let's discuss this at home.

00:12:31.799 --> 00:12:32.879
Afraid of losing face?

00:12:33.399 --> 00:12:34.120
I mean,

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.360
there's no need to argue here.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.679
I don't mean to argue.

00:12:44.159 --> 00:12:45.799
I want to clarify things.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.039
Zeng Jie.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.639
I nearly died this time.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.639
It made me realize many things.

00:12:53.399 --> 00:12:54.159
There's

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.480
no perfect couple in the world.

00:12:56.679 --> 00:12:58.159
Now that I'm in this state,

00:12:58.399 --> 00:12:59.279
if we divorce,

00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:00.159
my parents will

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.240
ask you for money.

00:13:01.919 --> 00:13:02.960
Don't tell me

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.320
any excuse.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.679
You know well how much money

00:13:05.759 --> 00:13:06.840
you took.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.159
I'm calmly discussing

00:13:08.159 --> 00:13:09.000
this with you,

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.240
and negotiating

00:13:10.679 --> 00:13:12.399
terms we can both accept.

00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:26.240
Go ahead.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:27.799
First,

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.480
you act as a devoted husband.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.120
In public,

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.039
show your

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:32.960
loyalty

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:33.919
and love toward me.

00:13:34.399 --> 00:13:35.279
For any events

00:13:35.399 --> 00:13:36.919
requiring spouses to attend,

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.080
you must bring me.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.360
Rest assured,

00:13:40.759 --> 00:13:41.879
even in a wheelchair,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.120
I won't embarrass you.

00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:45.200
Bear with it.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.360
It'll help

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.559
your public image.

00:13:50.159 --> 00:13:50.720
And second?

00:13:51.159 --> 00:13:51.840
No divorce

00:13:51.919 --> 00:13:53.120
in three years.

00:13:53.639 --> 00:13:54.399
After three years,

00:13:54.519 --> 00:13:55.399
I might adjust

00:13:55.559 --> 00:13:56.320
to wheelchair life

00:13:56.799 --> 00:13:58.080
and my outlook could improve.

00:13:58.159 --> 00:13:59.039
If you want divorce,

00:13:59.080 --> 00:13:59.679
I would agree

00:13:59.759 --> 00:14:00.480
and set you free.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.600
In these three years,

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.399
act as a devoted husband

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.799
in public.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.080
No need to come home,

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.279
or spend time with me.

00:14:07.759 --> 00:14:08.360
You can

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.440
be with any women you like,

00:14:09.559 --> 00:14:10.759
and I won't interfere.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:16.840
And third?

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:17.840
Of course.

00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:20.200
You know what it is.

00:14:21.039 --> 00:14:22.679
Repaying my parents' money gradually.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:23.840
I got it.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.159
I'll accept my losses.

00:14:25.279 --> 00:14:26.320
Just return

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.720
three million annually

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:29.519
for three years.

00:14:29.639 --> 00:14:30.840
Nine million totals.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:31.759
It's less than

00:14:31.759 --> 00:14:32.840
half of what you took.

00:14:32.879 --> 00:14:33.399
Bai Xiaoling.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.440
I've told you many times

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.159
that money is in the fund...

00:14:36.399 --> 00:14:37.679
Details aren't my concern.

00:14:37.879 --> 00:14:38.600
I've heard it

00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:39.440
enough.

00:14:39.519 --> 00:14:40.279
I'm sick of it.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.000
I want no excuses,

00:14:42.039 --> 00:14:42.720
but money.

00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:44.679
Nine million in three years.

00:14:45.399 --> 00:14:46.559
Can you manage it?

00:14:51.559 --> 00:14:52.679
I think...

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.000
Before my accident,

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:55.960
you

00:14:56.159 --> 00:14:57.799
sent my car for maintenance.

00:14:59.919 --> 00:15:01.120
And the car

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.320
had brake failure right after that.

00:15:11.799 --> 00:15:12.559
Bai Xiaoling,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.320
what do you mean?

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.200
Do you think I'd harm...

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.879
I know you wouldn't harm me.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.360
But if

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.559
you don't agree to my terms,

00:15:23.799 --> 00:15:25.159
we'll divorce now.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.840
And I'll publicly announce

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.159
you took my car for maintenance.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:29.840
Master Zeng,

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.360
you abandoned your wife

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.519
after she got disabled.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.080
Moreover, the accident's cause

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.480
could raise suspicions.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.879
Your reputation, your image,

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.000
and your credibility.

00:15:38.519 --> 00:15:39.480
What would happen then?

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.120
Bai Xiaoling,

00:15:55.399 --> 00:15:56.960
don't push me!

00:15:57.759 --> 00:15:58.840
Do I push you?

00:16:00.039 --> 00:16:01.200
My dad is a millionaire.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.039
Who are you?

00:16:02.039 --> 00:16:03.759
A fake master propped up by money.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.039
Marrying me grants you

00:16:05.039 --> 00:16:05.960
an immediate success.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.279
Do I push you?

00:16:10.039 --> 00:16:11.399
One last question.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.600
Do you agree

00:16:14.799 --> 00:16:16.000
to my three terms?

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:28.759
Fine.

00:16:29.919 --> 00:16:30.879
Do as you said.

00:16:37.524 --> 00:16:40.032
(Supermarket)

00:16:40.639 --> 00:16:42.000
Can you finish that much?

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.320
Much?

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.759
When I accompanied Bai Xiaoling

00:16:44.759 --> 00:16:45.799
to the wet market,

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.159
she spent over a thousand.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.399
Now you've

00:16:50.519 --> 00:16:51.440
accompanied her

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.559
on shopping trips?

00:16:52.799 --> 00:16:53.600
Zeng Jie might

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:54.360
find it out.

00:16:54.399 --> 00:16:55.240
I did nothing wrong.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.200
What's there to fear?

00:16:57.799 --> 00:16:58.679
Let me ask you.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.600
If you were Bai Xiaoling,

00:17:00.639 --> 00:17:01.519
a wealthy woman,

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.559
bought fish and meat

00:17:02.559 --> 00:17:03.960
your husband loves

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:04.720
in the wet market,

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:05.599
yet he

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.200
couldn't come home for dinner,

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:08.640
would you store these items

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:09.799
in the fridge

00:17:10.039 --> 00:17:11.119
or feed them to the dog?

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.119
In the fridge.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.960
But she fed them to her dog.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.440
The lifestyles of the rich

00:17:31.519 --> 00:17:32.640
are just different.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.519
When Zeng Jie's

00:17:33.599 --> 00:17:34.480
at the Artist Village,

00:17:34.599 --> 00:17:35.920
a rich lady went to him.

00:17:36.119 --> 00:17:37.079
I asked about it.

00:17:37.119 --> 00:17:37.720
Bai Xiaoling?

00:17:38.039 --> 00:17:38.839
Not her.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.839
Zeng Jie is impressive,

00:17:41.119 --> 00:17:42.519
always attracting rich ladies.

00:17:43.279 --> 00:17:44.319
Why can't I get through

00:17:44.319 --> 00:17:45.200
to Lin Fang?

00:17:47.039 --> 00:17:49.000
Two days ago,
I went to the Artist Village

00:17:49.039 --> 00:17:50.480
and knew that Lin Fang

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.640
comes from a village.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.839
But different from Zeng Jie's, far apart.

00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:56.200
So? Want to visit there?

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.720
We've come this far.

00:17:57.839 --> 00:17:59.119
Why not give it a try?

00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:03.279
You can go,

00:18:03.839 --> 00:18:04.960
but remember...

00:18:05.079 --> 00:18:05.920
I know.

00:18:06.079 --> 00:18:07.079
Stay legitimate.

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:08.440
When have I ever

00:18:08.519 --> 00:18:09.279
caused trouble?

00:18:10.359 --> 00:18:11.559
Yesterday, someone

00:18:11.559 --> 00:18:12.680
got detained.

00:18:13.799 --> 00:18:14.599
Sometimes,

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.160
you should shut up.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.880
(Lin Fang)
Lin Fang.

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:23.279
(Did you die
before Bai Xiaoling appeared)

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.200
(or after?)

00:18:30.079 --> 00:18:31.960
That sports car rich lady
isn't Bai Xiaoling.

00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:33.960
(? Lin Fang)
(Then who is she?)

00:18:39.359 --> 00:18:40.200
What are you doing?

00:18:40.799 --> 00:18:41.519
Solving a case?

00:18:41.599 --> 00:18:42.519
Why are you here?

00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:44.200
I was filming something nearby.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.839
Just dropped by.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.079
Why did you ask me

00:18:49.079 --> 00:18:50.440
to put on a show today?

00:18:55.599 --> 00:18:57.079
You're investigating this woman?

00:19:04.319 --> 00:19:05.480
What's this projector for?

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.640
The room needed some lighting.

00:19:07.759 --> 00:19:09.279
Consider it ambient lighting.

00:19:10.359 --> 00:19:11.759
You put it upside down.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.000
What?

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.440
Maybe it is right,

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.039
but our world is upside down.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.880
Your ex-girlfriend?

00:19:22.119 --> 00:19:23.240
What are you trying to do?

00:19:24.079 --> 00:19:25.319
Wei's disappeared.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.799
Disappeared?

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.519
Didn't she dump you last year?

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.319
I suspect
she went disappeared last year.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:32.880
Moreover,

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.359
it's very likely she's gone.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.880
Big Hui, don't scare me.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:36.960
I know you make

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.279
mystery investigation videos.

00:19:42.799 --> 00:19:43.599
Seriously?

00:19:46.319 --> 00:19:46.920
Seriously.

00:19:56.119 --> 00:19:57.000
This is a painting?

00:19:57.799 --> 00:19:59.160
I thought it was a print.

00:19:59.359 --> 00:20:00.480
It's well-painted.

00:20:02.839 --> 00:20:03.440
Hello.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.240
Ask your owner

00:20:05.559 --> 00:20:06.680
how much for this painting.

00:20:08.839 --> 00:20:10.759
Why buy a replica?

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.240
Should be between the 100th and 200th.

00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:15.880
What?

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.480
What are you doing?

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.119
I have

00:20:26.119 --> 00:20:27.559
a deeply hidden past.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:29.839
Want to hear it?

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.279
Is it just hidden

00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:33.799
or shameful?

00:20:36.039 --> 00:20:37.039
Hidden

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.279
and shameful.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.960
Since sophomore year,

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.400
I never went home during holidays.

00:20:49.599 --> 00:20:50.200
I worked at

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.720
a handmade painting village.

00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:54.519
It was a magical place.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.359
There were

00:20:56.759 --> 00:20:58.279
over a dozen painting workshops.

00:20:58.599 --> 00:21:00.200
(Masterpiece, Special Offer, Monet, Oil Paintings, Final Sale)
They made their living via painting.

00:21:00.839 --> 00:21:01.759
You can find

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.039
Van Gogh, Gauguin, Pissarro,

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.000
Monet, Renoir

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.160
in the village.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.359
Go deeper,

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.119
you'd find Degas and Manet.

00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:14.559
Even a Dadaism studio.

00:21:17.599 --> 00:21:19.119
In this tiny village,

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.640
they covered

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.240
almost all the Impressionist masters.

00:21:23.279 --> 00:21:24.519
Instant noodles please.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.440
The grocery store

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.559
accepted purchase on credit.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.240
The owner's ledger

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.599
listed debts under masters' names.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.640
Monet owed 350.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.200
Gauguin owed 400.

00:21:38.599 --> 00:21:39.319
Thanks.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.039
On credit?

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.160
Back then at the Monet studio,

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.640
I mostly painted

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.559
this, Sunrise.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.880
Other works didn't sell well.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.480
The studio

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.880
would have over 20 people

00:21:58.559 --> 00:22:00.160
during peak.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.839
I was the fastest painter.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.079
I could paint two at once.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.079
Each painting

00:22:09.559 --> 00:22:11.200
earned me 150 yuan.

00:22:11.319 --> 00:22:12.640
During holidays,

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.319
I could paint dozens.

00:22:14.559 --> 00:22:15.759
I stayed up all nights

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.400
to finish two pieces.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.119
My tuition and living expenses

00:22:21.799 --> 00:22:23.200
all came from this.

00:22:38.119 --> 00:22:39.400
So,

00:22:40.119 --> 00:22:41.519
you painted this?

00:22:42.279 --> 00:22:43.680
When I worried about

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.279
the tuition for postgraduate study,

00:22:48.119 --> 00:22:49.319
my dad got hospitalized.

00:22:50.119 --> 00:22:51.000
The doctor said

00:22:51.799 --> 00:22:53.039
it required 400,000

00:22:54.519 --> 00:22:55.200
to save his life.

00:22:57.559 --> 00:22:59.079
I couldn't even afford that.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.480
So I vowed

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.359
(Large Volume, Special Offer)
(to complete 2,000 paintings)

00:23:04.839 --> 00:23:06.200
(to earn money.)

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.119
(Back then, I left a serial number)

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.960
(on every painting I drew.)

00:23:57.559 --> 00:23:59.039
So, I'm certain this piece is

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.559
between the 100th and 200th.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.519
How can you tell?

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.240
When doing such work,

00:24:06.559 --> 00:24:07.640
one'd start

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.160
meticulously.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.839
But when painting
the 100th to 200th piece,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.200
exhaustion sets in.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.440
The work

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.640
becomes rushed.

00:24:16.799 --> 00:24:18.119
After the 200th pieces,

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.400
the technique matures

00:24:19.759 --> 00:24:22.319
and the lines flow more smoothly.

00:24:22.839 --> 00:24:25.200
That's why the 100th to 200th pieces

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.079
are the worst.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.200
I've never shared

00:24:37.279 --> 00:24:38.240
this part of my history.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.240
This story is actually cool.

00:24:40.319 --> 00:24:40.920
I know that.

00:24:41.599 --> 00:24:42.480
But the strong

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.200
don't peddle past stories.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.039
You're here?

00:24:55.759 --> 00:24:56.559
Wait downstairs.

00:24:58.119 --> 00:24:58.920
My brother-in-law.

00:25:00.519 --> 00:25:00.920
Bro...

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:01.559
Shut up.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.119
It's ready.

00:25:07.079 --> 00:25:08.279
Stop calling me that.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.240
Just leave.

00:25:11.079 --> 00:25:12.839
Why in a rush to kick me out?

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.640
Someone is inside?

00:25:17.519 --> 00:25:18.400
Who is it?

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:19.960
Afraid I'll see her

00:25:20.079 --> 00:25:21.359
or afraid to see me?

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.880
Impressive!

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.960
New fling every day?

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.440
Don't talk nonsense!

00:25:28.519 --> 00:25:30.000
What?

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.400
When you dated my sister,

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.519
did I ever complain?

00:25:32.799 --> 00:25:34.799
I always had your back.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.960
You've got so many women,

00:25:40.119 --> 00:25:41.720
but I've only had you.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:42.880
Enough!

00:25:43.119 --> 00:25:44.079
Take the money and go.

00:25:45.759 --> 00:25:46.519
Fine.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.440
I'll come again.

00:26:00.799 --> 00:26:02.079
I received a gift,

00:26:02.279 --> 00:26:03.039
very special.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.119
Just an ordinary piece of work.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.599
This is a hairpin, right?

00:26:08.079 --> 00:26:09.079
Since childhood, no one

00:26:09.319 --> 00:26:10.319
ever made anything

00:26:10.359 --> 00:26:11.240
for me.

00:26:11.599 --> 00:26:12.960
You even engraved a poem?

00:26:13.559 --> 00:26:16.279
I yearn to send a letter to my beloved.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.359
But mountains stretch, rivers flow.
I have no idea where my beloved is.

00:26:22.519 --> 00:26:23.319
Why can't I

00:26:23.319 --> 00:26:24.119
recognize it?

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.759
In ancient script.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Just knowing the meaning.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.720
I'm looking it up.

00:26:30.279 --> 00:26:31.599
Yan Shu's poem?

00:26:32.039 --> 00:26:33.279
I yearn to send a letter

00:26:33.359 --> 00:26:34.359
to my beloved.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.160
But mountains stretch, rivers flow.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.839
I have no idea

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.319
where my beloved is.

00:26:41.319 --> 00:26:42.440
You don't know where I am,

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.880
then how did you send this?

00:26:44.319 --> 00:26:46.039
You know it's about you?

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.000
Where are you?

00:26:49.759 --> 00:26:50.759
Wilderness.

00:26:51.359 --> 00:26:52.960
Where exactly?

00:26:53.319 --> 00:26:54.640
I'm telling the truth.

00:26:55.759 --> 00:26:56.960
Why go there?

00:26:58.039 --> 00:26:59.240
Just killed someone,

00:26:59.599 --> 00:27:00.920
need to dispose of the body.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.720
Let me guess.

00:27:02.759 --> 00:27:04.160
Are you digging clay

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.839
for ceramics?

00:27:06.119 --> 00:27:07.200
You're so smart.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.559
When are you returning?

00:27:10.359 --> 00:27:11.640
Should finish soon.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.680
Dinner together?

00:27:16.119 --> 00:27:16.720
Sure.

00:27:17.319 --> 00:27:18.000
My friend

00:27:18.079 --> 00:27:19.319
runs a private kitchen.

00:27:19.559 --> 00:27:20.200
Pretty good.

00:27:20.359 --> 00:27:22.440
Anything's fine.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:23.839
Okay.

00:27:24.519 --> 00:27:27.240
I'll book a table.

00:28:32.319 --> 00:28:33.119
Sorry,

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.240
I'm late.

00:28:35.079 --> 00:28:35.960
Need to wash my hands.

00:28:36.599 --> 00:28:38.000
I've asked the chef to prepare.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.200
My mom is coming to visit.

00:29:17.799 --> 00:29:19.279
Don't drag me into it.

00:29:19.759 --> 00:29:21.000
No need to say so.

00:29:21.759 --> 00:29:22.799
I know you and my mom

00:29:22.799 --> 00:29:23.880
are always at odds.

00:29:24.519 --> 00:29:26.119
Don't make it sound trivial.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.960
I could tolerate your mom,

00:29:28.319 --> 00:29:29.799
but she's been hating me.

00:29:30.039 --> 00:29:31.480
Even now, I still don't understand

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.200
why she hates me.

00:29:33.319 --> 00:29:34.559
Not at all.

00:29:35.319 --> 00:29:37.119
You always exaggerate things.

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:38.880
Please understand.

00:29:39.359 --> 00:29:41.079
She's just an ignorant old woman.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.720
No need to take her seriously.

00:29:43.119 --> 00:29:44.240
Do I?

00:29:44.519 --> 00:29:45.640
Since we got married,

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.759
I have been

00:29:46.799 --> 00:29:48.000
showing her respect.

00:29:48.519 --> 00:29:49.680
Like you said,

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.400
she's just an ignorant old woman.

00:29:51.599 --> 00:29:53.200
But I'm not an ignorant daughter-in-law.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.640
Since you met me,

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.680
you knew it.

00:29:56.319 --> 00:29:57.319
Is it my fault?

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.200
Unreasonable.

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:02.640
You better

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.519
think carefully

00:30:03.519 --> 00:30:04.759
before saying that.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.759
I'm unreasonable?

00:30:07.519 --> 00:30:08.400
When we got married,

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.279
your mom asked

00:30:09.279 --> 00:30:10.240
many relatives to come,

00:30:10.359 --> 00:30:11.160
and my parents

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.240
arranged hotels for them.

00:30:12.319 --> 00:30:13.400
Those distant relatives

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.240
you couldn't name

00:30:14.319 --> 00:30:15.640
could stay at five-star hotels.

00:30:15.839 --> 00:30:17.400
Your mom even got an executive suite.

00:30:17.599 --> 00:30:18.680
After we got married,

00:30:18.759 --> 00:30:19.720
I treated your mom well.

00:30:20.039 --> 00:30:21.440
We've kept a room for her.

00:30:21.759 --> 00:30:22.440
Every visit,

00:30:22.599 --> 00:30:23.319
I get her

00:30:23.319 --> 00:30:24.359
new bedding.

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.599
I even hire a housekeeper

00:30:25.759 --> 00:30:27.319
to save her from housework.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.720
Do you think

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.279
marrying an ignorant woman

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.160
who hates your mom

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.039
would be reasonable?

00:30:32.039 --> 00:30:33.000
I mean,

00:30:33.319 --> 00:30:34.960
you could be more tolerant.

00:30:35.519 --> 00:30:36.759
How much more do you expect?

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:37.799
Why can't your mom

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.079
be tolerant?

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.519
She always tells me

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.640
you were outstanding

00:30:41.759 --> 00:30:42.559
and accomplished,

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.359
the pride

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.279
of your village.

00:30:44.559 --> 00:30:46.119
She keeps telling me this.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.440
Think I don't deserve you

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.079
or worry you don't deserve me?

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.079
Alright, alright.

00:30:50.359 --> 00:30:51.079
Stop it.

00:30:52.039 --> 00:30:52.759
I know

00:30:53.119 --> 00:30:54.519
you've always treated my mom well.

00:30:54.799 --> 00:30:55.880
But you know

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.920
I come from a humble origin.

00:30:58.119 --> 00:30:59.000
It was really tough

00:30:59.079 --> 00:31:00.039
for my mom to raise me.

00:31:00.119 --> 00:31:01.000
I know it.

00:31:01.519 --> 00:31:02.599
You often tell me

00:31:02.599 --> 00:31:03.799
how hard your mom worked.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:04.640
You work so hard

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.559
to repay your parents

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:06.759
and ensure her comfort.

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.039
I understand all that.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.200
But Zeng Jie,

00:31:09.559 --> 00:31:11.559
your mom worked hard
because your family was poor.

00:31:11.559 --> 00:31:12.480
My mom had an easy life

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.599
because my dad worked hard

00:31:13.759 --> 00:31:15.200
when he was young.

00:31:15.599 --> 00:31:17.119
You're now a university professor,

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.599
a respected scholar.

00:31:18.839 --> 00:31:19.799
You can't threaten me

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.160
with this 'poor-me' mind.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:21.799
Fine.

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.000
I'll stop.

00:31:23.839 --> 00:31:24.759
Just put on a show.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:25.920
My mom won't

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:26.880
stay long anyway.

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.759
Alright, let the show begin.

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.920
I'm always in a show anyway.

00:31:32.359 --> 00:31:33.279
When is she arriving?

00:31:34.039 --> 00:31:35.160
She'll take the night train,

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.400
arrive tomorrow morning.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.920
Classes tomorrow, right?

00:31:38.559 --> 00:31:39.319
I'll pick her up.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.160
You?

00:31:41.359 --> 00:31:42.119
Better not.

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.359
Last time you picked her up,

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.079
you made a mess.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.000
Mom carried three bags,

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.000
and had to push your wheelchair.

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.839
You can't cross the overpass,

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.759
reach the ride-hailing pickup spot.

00:31:54.039 --> 00:31:55.559
You and Mom stood there

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.119
for over an hour.

00:31:57.599 --> 00:31:58.559
No, Mom was standing,

00:31:59.079 --> 00:31:59.920
while you sitting.

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.640
Then I had to rush

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:02.400
there,

00:32:02.799 --> 00:32:03.640
leaving my students

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.599
sketch on their own.

00:32:06.359 --> 00:32:07.480
I'll go pick her up.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.519
I'll rearrange my schedule.

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:11.559
Alright.

00:32:12.119 --> 00:32:13.039
I'll go buy groceries

00:32:13.119 --> 00:32:14.559
and prepare lunch.

00:32:18.039 --> 00:32:19.160
Why do you always go out

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.000
to buy groceries?

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.680
Why not order home delivery?

00:32:23.039 --> 00:32:24.359
I like going to the wet market.

00:32:24.839 --> 00:32:26.160
Don't want to stay at home.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.119
I just don't want you

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.119
to get exhausted.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.640
I'm under assessment
at the school this week.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.559
So annoying.

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.279
I almost forgot.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.039
You are

00:32:42.039 --> 00:32:43.319
still an associate professor.

00:32:48.759 --> 00:32:49.559
Here, Mom.

00:32:50.759 --> 00:32:51.640
Put it here.

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:52.319
I'll take it.

00:32:55.079 --> 00:32:55.880
Mom, you're here.

00:32:56.359 --> 00:32:57.519
Come have the meal.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:58.880
I hired a chef

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.359
this morning

00:33:00.519 --> 00:33:01.319
to cook.

00:33:01.759 --> 00:33:02.640
So many dishes!

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:03.640
Mom, take a seat.

00:33:09.079 --> 00:33:09.599
Mom.

00:33:14.599 --> 00:33:15.559
I made

00:33:15.599 --> 00:33:16.880
your favorite soup.

00:33:17.319 --> 00:33:18.119
Have some soup.

00:33:18.119 --> 00:33:18.759
Sit.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.279
By the way,

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:21.880
I bought some drinks

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.039
at the supermarket.

00:33:23.279 --> 00:33:24.160
Already paid.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.480
Go pick them up.

00:33:26.079 --> 00:33:26.559
Okay.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:27.880
Mom, eat without me.

00:33:28.079 --> 00:33:28.599
Don't wait.

00:33:28.799 --> 00:33:29.599
Come back early.

00:33:29.799 --> 00:33:30.160
Okay.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:31.279
Mom.

00:33:32.319 --> 00:33:33.400
Have some soup.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:36.799
Leave it here.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.119
What?

00:33:49.319 --> 00:33:49.960
Look at

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.240
your long face.

00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:52.119
What do you want?

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:53.519
I'll stab you,

00:33:53.519 --> 00:33:54.880
you shrew!

00:33:56.319 --> 00:33:57.279
I'll stab you to death,

00:33:57.279 --> 00:33:58.480
you shrew!

00:33:58.519 --> 00:33:59.680
Come on, kill me now.

00:33:59.799 --> 00:34:00.839
Think I won't stab you?

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.079
You've wanted me dead.

00:34:02.359 --> 00:34:03.119
You've wanted

00:34:03.119 --> 00:34:04.480
another daughter-in-law.

00:34:04.599 --> 00:34:05.799
Then find someone obedient

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:06.920
to visit you in prison

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:07.680
during holidays.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:08.440
Shut up!

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.599
Stab me

00:34:09.599 --> 00:34:10.840
and you can get a new one.

00:34:11.119 --> 00:34:13.679
You'll know who has a problem
when she can't be pregnant.

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.000
Shut up!

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:15.760
You jinx!

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:31.320
Mom, calm down.

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.000
I really didn't mean to.

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:33.840
Honey,

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.360
I accidentally spilled soup on Mom.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.639
I didn't mean to.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:37.679
Mom, calm down.

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:38.760
Don't trust her.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:39.719
Mom, calm down.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.559
She hit me first.

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:42.440
Okay, Mom.

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.119
The blood on her face,

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.440
she did that herself.

00:34:45.559 --> 00:34:46.760
I didn't hurt her.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:47.960
Honey, I did it myself.

00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:49.239
When Mom threw the soup,

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:50.079
I didn't catch it.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.159
Don't blame her.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.679
Cut the nonsense!

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:53.000
You!

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:53.800
Calm down, Mom.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.039
I'll tear you apart!

00:35:02.239 --> 00:35:03.119
Honey.

00:35:03.239 --> 00:35:04.440
Calm Mom down.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.400
Drop the act.

00:35:05.519 --> 00:35:06.400
How dare you!

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.159
I didn't mean to.

00:35:07.159 --> 00:35:07.760
Calm down.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:08.599
Try again!

00:35:08.599 --> 00:35:09.480
Stop this, Mom.

00:35:14.199 --> 00:35:15.239
Alright, Mom.

00:35:16.559 --> 00:35:17.239
Calm down.

00:35:17.719 --> 00:35:18.920
She's lying.

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:19.679
Jie.

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:42.519
Let me tell you.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.639
You have no idea.

00:35:45.079 --> 00:35:46.199
Once you left,

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.800
she slapped me in the face.

00:35:48.239 --> 00:35:49.599
Before I react,

00:35:49.719 --> 00:35:51.519
(October 9, 2019, Wednesday)
she slapped me again,

00:35:51.639 --> 00:35:52.920
yanked my hair,

00:35:53.199 --> 00:35:54.920
and pinned me
against the table to beat me.

00:35:55.039 --> 00:35:55.840
Impossible!

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.079
She can't even stand up.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.320
You don't believe me?

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:00.760
She even broke a cup

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.639
and tried to stab me.

00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:04.159
Then I grabbed a knife.

00:36:04.239 --> 00:36:04.800
Fine, Mom.

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:05.599
It's all her fault.

00:36:05.639 --> 00:36:06.440
It's all her fault.

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:06.920
Jie.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:07.559
Let me tell you.

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:08.920
Just dump her.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.400
She's pure evil.

00:36:10.679 --> 00:36:11.440
You must

00:36:12.039 --> 00:36:13.599
get a divorce.

00:36:14.079 --> 00:36:15.639
You're now a renowned artist

00:36:15.679 --> 00:36:16.639
and a public figure.

00:36:17.039 --> 00:36:17.719
She doesn't

00:36:17.719 --> 00:36:18.760
deserve you!

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.079
After the divorce,

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.360
find someone new

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:23.719
and gentle

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:24.880
who treats you well.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.079
You've achieved a lot,

00:36:27.159 --> 00:36:28.159
with handsome looks.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.559
Just find another woman.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:30.559
Mom.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.719
Not at all.

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:34.880
What do you mean?

00:36:35.159 --> 00:36:35.599
You...

00:36:36.119 --> 00:36:38.119
You don't want to leave her?

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.639
Just because of her wealthy family?

00:36:41.639 --> 00:36:43.400
Her father is

00:36:44.039 --> 00:36:46.119
bedridden now,

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.239
know why?

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.119
Karma!

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:50.880
They are heartless.

00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:52.679
Deserve punishment.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.239
Right.

00:36:54.519 --> 00:36:55.480
Know what she just said?

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:56.360
Well,

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.440
if you get divorced

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.159
and remarry,

00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.559
then still can't have children

00:36:59.599 --> 00:37:00.360
then we'll know

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.159
who has the problem.

00:37:01.239 --> 00:37:02.400
What does she mean?

00:37:06.079 --> 00:37:06.639
Mom.

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.400
Listen to me.

00:37:09.199 --> 00:37:10.000
I will

00:37:10.199 --> 00:37:11.559
definitely get a divorce.

00:37:13.119 --> 00:37:13.719
Before,

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:14.679
she can

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:17.159
match me in every way.

00:37:17.559 --> 00:37:18.400
Not anymore.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.079
How could I spend my life with her?

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:22.960
Then hurry up.

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.440
What are you waiting for?

00:37:24.559 --> 00:37:25.079
Mom.

00:37:25.119 --> 00:37:26.440
I told you on the way here.

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.239
I'm under assessment now.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.480
If all goes well,

00:37:30.679 --> 00:37:32.400
I'll soon become a full professor.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.679
At this critical moment,

00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:35.760
no scandals allowed.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.000
If I have

00:37:37.079 --> 00:37:38.400
a family issue now,

00:37:38.719 --> 00:37:40.159
it'll ruin my career.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.159
I see.

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.920
Calm down, Mom.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.519
After the rating,

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:46.960
I'll make it done soon.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.000
Okay?

00:37:48.199 --> 00:37:49.360
Alright.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.239
If you divorced,

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:51.599
you're entitled

00:37:51.719 --> 00:37:52.400
to her money

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.400
and this house.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.519
This is joint marital property.

00:37:55.599 --> 00:37:56.599
I've consulted lawyers.

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.840
You must claim your half.

00:38:00.199 --> 00:38:00.840
Jie.

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.400
You are

00:38:02.639 --> 00:38:03.920
the most outstanding

00:38:04.079 --> 00:38:05.000
and the most awesome

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.639
in our village.

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.199
Let me tell you.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.039
You're awesome.

00:38:10.039 --> 00:38:10.880
Bai Xiaoling

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:11.800
doesn't deserve you.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.199
She doesn't match you.

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:13.960
Kick her out!

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:14.679
Out!

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.440
Okay, Mom.

00:38:17.719 --> 00:38:19.199
Calm down now.

00:38:20.079 --> 00:38:20.960
You'd go to her?

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:22.639
I'll go teach her a lesson.

00:38:24.079 --> 00:38:24.960
Alright, Mom.

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:25.920
Calm down.

00:38:27.091 --> 00:38:31.296
(October 9, 2019, Wednesday)

00:38:55.079 --> 00:38:55.960
What?

00:38:58.159 --> 00:38:58.840
I know

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.159
my mom

00:39:00.239 --> 00:39:01.239
didn't tell the truth.

00:39:01.639 --> 00:39:02.840
No, your mom is right.

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.119
She told you the truth.

00:39:04.519 --> 00:39:06.119
She didn't exaggerate things.

00:39:07.239 --> 00:39:08.239
I know my mom.

00:39:09.199 --> 00:39:10.079
She does like

00:39:10.119 --> 00:39:11.000
to exaggerate things.

00:39:11.239 --> 00:39:12.039
But in this...

00:39:12.119 --> 00:39:12.840
Stop it.

00:39:13.679 --> 00:39:14.039
Zeng Jie,

00:39:14.079 --> 00:39:14.960
just trust

00:39:15.039 --> 00:39:16.039
your mom.

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.559
She would never exaggerate.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:18.840
Fine.

00:39:19.159 --> 00:39:20.119
Let's stop arguing.

00:39:21.199 --> 00:39:22.000
First, I never said

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.079
whose fault it is.

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.159
It's my fault.

00:39:31.159 --> 00:39:32.440
Now my mom insists on leaving.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.159
So you mean,

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:35.159
I should leave?

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.280
I didn't mean that.

00:39:36.559 --> 00:39:37.599
I'll move

00:39:37.679 --> 00:39:38.480
to my mom's place.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:39.559
Let your mom

00:39:39.599 --> 00:39:40.679
stay in my house

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.079
and be with her son, okay?

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:44.599
Don't sigh.

00:39:44.679 --> 00:39:45.599
I'll call a cab now.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.960
My mom insists on leaving.

00:39:52.239 --> 00:39:53.400
I'll book her ticket.

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.239
I'll take her to eat first,
then take her to the station.

00:40:06.679 --> 00:40:07.199
Hire

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.119
a housekeeper

00:40:09.159 --> 00:40:09.920
to tidy up.

00:40:53.171 --> 00:40:54.089
Come over here a bit.

00:40:54.227 --> 00:40:55.208
The one in the middle?

00:40:55.692 --> 00:40:56.675
Zoom in now.

00:41:04.724 --> 00:41:05.502
Master Zeng.

00:41:06.464 --> 00:41:08.130
I'm really worthless.

00:41:09.664 --> 00:41:10.816
Who would want it?

00:41:10.941 --> 00:41:11.950

Don't worry.

00:41:35.572 --> 00:41:36.019
Ah?

00:41:36.403 --> 00:41:37.350

Come have the meal.

00:41:58.899 --> 00:42:01.462
