00:02:18.887 --> 00:02:25.569
(October 21, 2018)

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.719
Why didn't you reply me

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.800
last night?

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.199
I was busy,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.360
monitoring the kiln.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:33.879
No time to check my phone.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.000
This afternoon,

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.560
you took ages to reply me too.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.120
I was in

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.199
a fire safety training.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.159
And I even demonstrated

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.719
evacuation drills

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.599
with firefighters.

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.560
You should tell them

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.759
that you set fire every day.

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:53.159
You're professional.

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:54.479
That's different.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.400
Fire brings destruction,

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:58.000
and I create art.

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.960
What about me?

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.719
Fire extinguisher?

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.439
You're the ignition.

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:06.759
Then today,

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:08.400
should I set you on fire?

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:10.240
Not today.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.879
Today...

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.719
Alright, I'm just teasing.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.159
I'm busy today too.

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.240
Go work hard, Professor Zeng.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.599
I'm leaving.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.960
Flowers for sale.

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:32.000
Flowers for sale.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.879
I'll buy them all. Keep the change.

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:44.400
Thank you.

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:50.120
Don't worry about anything.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.520
Operations are running well,

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.719
and the fund stays stable.

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:53.919
Leave them be.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.199
Your priority now

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.240
is to recover.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.919
While your mom's away,

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:03.000
let me sneak a cigarette.

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:04.080
Sure.

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:19.360
Listen,

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.079
don't wave cigarettes

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.560
under my nose to tempt me

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.439
and test me.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.600
I'm disciplined.

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:27.079
I'll die before smoking.

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:32.720
Your dad keeps nagging

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:34.079
that he wants

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.240
to see you two

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:36.199
have kids soon.

00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:37.560
Mom,

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.519
we're both overwhelmed now.

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:44.000
Has he been

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.519
staying out often?

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:49.879
Is he having an affair?

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.480
He wouldn't dare.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.800
Back when you married,

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.800
he wouldn't.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.759
But these few years,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.879
as his career grows,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.920
who knows then?

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.240
When your dad's young,

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.680
he could stay loyal.

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:04.600
But then

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:05.959
with success

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.120
and wealth,

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:08.439
he couldn't anymore.

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:09.319
Mom,

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.720
enough with this talk.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.879
So listen,

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.839
if you want stability,

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.360
bind him with a child.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.800
Have kids soon.

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.199
Your generation's solution

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.279
isn't mine.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.279
Besides,

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:25.240
he's done nothing wrong.

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:28.519
(I booked us a room)
(We understand each other.)

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:30.920
(Chats deleted)
(Hope you're fine.)

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:33.839
(Contact removed)
(I won't push about kids.)

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:35.000
(Just keep it in mind.)

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:35.839
Understood.

00:05:58.319 --> 00:05:59.439
Too busy to cook,

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.480
I ordered takeout.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.240
Fine, anything works.

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:04.600
I visited the company today.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.959
You transferred money to the fund again?

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:07.720
Yes.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.000
Cultural industries

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.199
have bright prospects.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.639
Our fund...

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:12.680
You invest

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:13.800
most of the capital

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:14.920
into the ceramic factory.

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:16.879
And the rest

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
goes to the fund.

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:20.399
When can we profit
with all this investment?

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:23.839
The ceramic orders

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:24.600
keep coming.

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:25.839
We'll profit soon.

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:27.439
And our fund

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.399
has performed well.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.720
You've claimed it all along.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.639
So, where

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:31.399
is the profit?

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:33.279
The capital

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:33.920
was earned

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.439
by hard work of my parents.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.920
You invest it all,

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.800
but the profit?

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:43.199
Xiaoling,

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.600
the company's future

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.639
is promising.

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:49.000
You need to think long-term.

00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:50.240
Besides, we're family.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.399
Exactly, we're family.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.439
So, my parents trusted you

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:54.800
and handed the company to us.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.480
But you owe us

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.319
an explanation.

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:00.360
What do you mean?

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.399
You're fully aware

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:02.519
of my works' current value.

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:05.639
Value?

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.800
Professor Zeng.

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:15.079
Master Zeng.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.720
You won numerous awards.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.480
Works are highly sought after.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.240
By whom?

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.199
Your overpriced pieces are

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:23.360
artificially inflated

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.160
by the fund.

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:25.199
Those awards?

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:26.439
If I weren't your wife,

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.160
I would never

00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:27.920
know about

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.560
those obscure ceramic competitions.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.439
You spend much

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.480
on every competition.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.759
Creating new pieces, flying abroad,

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:36.399
and paying journalists

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.800
for promotion.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.480
- Is this the value?
- You're over the line!

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.480
Am I?

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:41.759
When we just married,

00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:42.839
you're a college lecturer

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:44.480
with less than 100 thousand yuan.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.079
I chose you for who you are.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.959
So do my parents.

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:49.519
Did we demand

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:50.920
a single penny from you?

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:51.959
You want to be

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:52.399
an artist,

00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:53.680
we support you.

00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:54.600
You want a career,

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.199
we support you

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.160
all along.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.399
I'm over the line?

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.759
Are you even a man?

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:04.680
Say that again!

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:05.800
You want to hit me?

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:09.439
Bai Xiaoling, listen.

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:10.519
Stop judging me

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.079
with your nouveau riche mindset.

00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:13.120
Today,

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.519
aesthetics has value

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.800
and art has value.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.560
My career, my achievements,

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.480
and my value

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.480
aren't something

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.560
you nouveau riche

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.480
could understand.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.360
Without my money,

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.839
you'd never have value!

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.519
Artist?

00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:26.759
You're no different

00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:28.240
from wife-beating illiterates!

00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:29.079
Then divorce!

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:36.960
Fine.

00:08:38.279 --> 00:08:40.120
Return my parents' money.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:41.960
We'll divorce.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.279
What money?

00:08:46.639 --> 00:08:47.320
That money

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.600
is the company capital.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.120
You're the legal representative

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.200
and the shareholder.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:51.879
Tell me,

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.856
what does it have to do with me?

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:54.960
Shameless!

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.159
Despicable!

00:09:13.879 --> 00:09:15.879
Hello, Mr. Sun.

00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:18.200
Yes, yes.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.879
About tomorrow's event?

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.360
How could I ever forget that?

00:09:24.279 --> 00:09:24.919
Don't worry.

00:09:25.679 --> 00:09:26.559
I'll be there on time.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:28.919
No problem.

00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:35.080
You must dress up

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.399
for tomorrow's event.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.639
Don't forget

00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:46.919
you're Master Zeng's wife.

00:09:54.879 --> 00:09:56.039
Have a meal without me.

00:09:56.559 --> 00:09:57.919
I'll go back to the studio.

00:09:58.399 --> 00:09:59.600
I'll pick you up tomorrow

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:00.960
at 2 PM.

00:10:15.759 --> 00:10:17.360
Do you even know how many people

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.639
named Liu Wei in this city?

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.080
More than Yang Zhenghui.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.440
But

00:10:22.879 --> 00:10:24.080
fewer than Li De, I suppose.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:26.919
So...

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.919
So it's so hard to find her.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:29.799
I know it.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.320
Actually, I'm kind of relieved.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.559
It shows

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.279
you've accepted

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.399
that Wei has vanished.

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:36.440
Not at all.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.080
I don't believe anything without proof.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.320
Do you have evidence?

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.080
After all your efforts,

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:44.639
say

00:10:44.799 --> 00:10:45.320
what you got.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.480
If I drink and drive,

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.360
then get caught

00:10:49.519 --> 00:10:50.360
by police,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.720
can you spare me?

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:52.919
No need.

00:10:53.159 --> 00:10:54.159
I'll arrest you myself.

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:57.120
Drinking with a police officer,

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:57.840
I thought

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.000
I'd get some privilege.

00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:00.519
I'll arrest you.

00:11:00.519 --> 00:11:01.360
Isn't it a privilege?

00:11:06.159 --> 00:11:07.080
This plate was made

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:09.159
in Light Strokes Art Studio's class

00:11:09.399 --> 00:11:10.399
Wei attended.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.519
(Light Strokes' classes)

00:11:12.519 --> 00:11:14.000
(use this plate,)

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.399
(a replica of a master's work.)

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:17.279
Not a deceased master,

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.039
but an alive one.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.039
Quite young.

00:11:19.919 --> 00:11:21.120
(A classmate of the owner,)

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.159
(a professor at
Caorong University, Zeng Jie.)

00:11:23.639 --> 00:11:24.440
The staff told me

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:25.440
they don't

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:26.759
mention blemish flaws

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.039
to students in all classes.

00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:30.000
But Master Zeng Jie

00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:31.679
is a perfectionist,

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.200
obsessive about blemish flaws.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:34.919
So far,

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.559
the only ones who mentioned

00:11:36.799 --> 00:11:37.480
'Perfectionist'

00:11:37.679 --> 00:11:38.960
and 'Blemish Flaws'

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.000
are Wei

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.240
and Zeng Jie.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.320
So you think

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.320
Wei is related to Zeng Jie?

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.000
Zeng Jie has a studio
at Shuiyuan Art Village.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.159
On the night

00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:49.399
of November 24, 2018,

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.000
(Art Studio Fire)
(a fire destroyed)

00:11:51.159 --> 00:11:52.039
(his studio.)

00:11:52.159 --> 00:11:52.960
Nothing remained.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.919
When did you break up with Liu Wei?

00:11:55.039 --> 00:11:55.600
October 20,

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.879
one month before the fire.

00:11:56.879 --> 00:11:58.679
(November 24)

00:11:58.679 --> 00:12:00.399
Wei stopped streaming
and updating videos

00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:02.200
(Wei Vivian, 380 days ago)
in that period.

00:12:04.679 --> 00:12:05.960
But that doesn't prove anything.

00:12:07.919 --> 00:12:08.799
While Wei dated me,

00:12:08.919 --> 00:12:09.799
attended the class,

00:12:09.879 --> 00:12:10.600
made this plate,

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.159
and met Zeng Jie.

00:12:12.519 --> 00:12:12.960
I am

00:12:13.679 --> 00:12:14.320
nobody.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.000
But Zeng Jie

00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:21.399
is a brilliant young professor,

00:12:21.679 --> 00:12:22.464
a ceramic master.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:23.879
A fire

00:12:24.159 --> 00:12:25.240
broke out in his studio

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.399
and Wei vanished.

00:12:26.879 --> 00:12:28.360
Do you think there's anything

00:12:28.559 --> 00:12:29.399
fishy in here?

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:33.879
Look, right?

00:12:34.279 --> 00:12:35.720
It means you have doubts too.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.240
I know it isn't

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.000
with procedures.

00:12:38.039 --> 00:12:39.000
Don't you think

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.240
my assumption is right?

00:12:41.879 --> 00:12:42.440
You said it's

00:12:42.879 --> 00:12:43.519
an assumption.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.000
Assume Liu Wei

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:45.919
is related

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:46.799
to the fire.

00:12:46.919 --> 00:12:48.279
But this fire case

00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:49.600
made the news.

00:12:49.824 --> 00:12:51.600
The fire department
must've investigated it.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:53.919
Let me tell you.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.159
Fire investigations

00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:57.120
require the strict search
for human remains.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.039
Anything's wrong,

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.159
would've been detected.

00:13:05.679 --> 00:13:06.360
How about this?

00:13:06.799 --> 00:13:07.360
Let me check

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.200
the fire reports

00:13:08.519 --> 00:13:09.600
to verify your theory.

00:13:11.264 --> 00:13:11.960
(November 24, 2018)

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:12.759
Come on, drink up.

00:13:12.919 --> 00:13:13.759
Take a group photo.

00:13:13.799 --> 00:13:14.679
Smile, everyone!

00:13:15.008 --> 00:13:16.338
Smile for me.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.679
Take a look.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.159
This photo was taken

00:13:24.279 --> 00:13:25.559
at 10:03 PM

00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:26.679
on November 24.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.559
All the guests were present.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.360
You often host

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:30.960
a party?

00:13:32.759 --> 00:13:33.879
Once every month or two.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.440
We're usually busy with work.

00:13:37.279 --> 00:13:38.720
After this photo was taken,

00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:40.000
(my wife said she's tired)

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.519
(and wanted to rest.)

00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:44.360
(Then I chatted)

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.720
(with others for over an hour.)

00:13:46.879 --> 00:13:47.679
(We wrapped up)

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.480
(around 11:30 PM.)

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.720
(Since my studio
is in Shuiyuan Art Village,)

00:13:54.039 --> 00:13:55.120
(taxi usually wait)

00:13:55.279 --> 00:13:56.639
(at the village entrance.)

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:57.559
(So,)

00:13:57.679 --> 00:13:59.279
(I saw friends off myself.)

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.000
(That's it.)

00:14:01.399 --> 00:14:02.399
Did you

00:14:02.559 --> 00:14:03.799
notice the charcoal brazier?

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:06.480
(No.)

00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:08.360
That was my fault.

00:14:09.879 --> 00:14:10.960
(After seeing friends off,)

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.000
(I went to check the kiln.)

00:14:13.399 --> 00:14:14.759
(While checking it,)

00:14:15.759 --> 00:14:16.759
(I noticed a fire.)

00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:19.519
So,

00:14:19.919 --> 00:14:20.919
you saw the fire on

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:21.759
the second floor?

00:14:21.759 --> 00:14:22.159
Correct.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.159
(First floor was safe when I was back,)

00:14:24.559 --> 00:14:25.399
(so I rushed)

00:14:25.759 --> 00:14:26.799
(to the second floor,)

00:14:27.919 --> 00:14:30.919
(where I keep my paintings)

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:31.919
(and similar items,)

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.200
(all inflammable materials.)

00:14:33.679 --> 00:14:34.840
(When I got there,)

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.360
(the fire was too big.)

00:14:37.559 --> 00:14:39.039
(Then I rushed to the third floor.)

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.919
(But the door was locked,)

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.399
so I had no choice but to

00:14:44.799 --> 00:14:46.039
kick it open violently.

00:14:46.559 --> 00:14:47.000
But

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:48.600
my wife wasn't inside.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.559
Then, I escaped.

00:14:51.919 --> 00:14:53.159
(Fortunately, I had)

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:53.960
(fireproof equips,)

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.559
(so I wrapped myself in a fire blanket)

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.799
(and put on a mask)

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.000
(before escaping.)

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.039
(Otherwise,)

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.840
(I might not have escaped as well.)

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.600
(Therefore,)

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.000
it's because of the charcoal brazier?

00:15:22.159 --> 00:15:23.600
Based on our current investigation,

00:15:23.679 --> 00:15:24.480
it should be so.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.440
(The brazier was too close)

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.000
(to the fabric sofa.)

00:15:28.799 --> 00:15:29.440
(Once ignited,)

00:15:29.639 --> 00:15:30.639
it'll catch fire quickly.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:31.639
There were

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:32.279
bottles of wine

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.120
(on your end table.)

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.639
(And two of them are)

00:15:34.879 --> 00:15:36.039
(with high alcohol content.)

00:15:36.039 --> 00:15:37.792
(My friend brought
the Spirytus for mixing.)

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:38.840
Very strong stuff.

00:15:39.559 --> 00:15:41.159
That makes it an oxidizer.

00:15:41.559 --> 00:15:42.120
Luckily,

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.799
your studio is far from

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.480
other buildings,

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.720
so the fire didn't

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.559
cause much loss.

00:15:48.559 --> 00:15:48.960
Right.

00:15:53.679 --> 00:15:54.320
This is...

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.799
(Silk Banner)
I sincerely thank you.

00:15:57.039 --> 00:15:57.639
Actually,

00:15:57.879 --> 00:15:59.000
when we got there,

00:15:59.200 --> 00:15:59.720
it's...

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:00.080
No, no.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.399
Here.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.039
If you didn't

00:16:04.159 --> 00:16:05.600
come to the school to conduct

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.639
fire safety training,

00:16:07.039 --> 00:16:08.480
I would never prepare something

00:16:08.799 --> 00:16:09.679
like fire blanket.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.720
And I didn't know

00:16:10.799 --> 00:16:11.440
how to use it.

00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:12.960
I learned it

00:16:13.159 --> 00:16:13.840
in the training.

00:16:14.799 --> 00:16:15.879
Glad to know

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:16.840
more about fires

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.600
and how to save myself

00:16:18.799 --> 00:16:19.639
in the fire.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:21.679
Professor Zeng,

00:16:22.039 --> 00:16:23.360
I heard many of your works

00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:24.600
got damaged

00:16:25.039 --> 00:16:26.000
in the fire.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.879
What a pity.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:29.840
Yes.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.639
In the history of art,

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.240
there were many works

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.480
failed to maintain,

00:16:36.039 --> 00:16:36.639
(but they have)

00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:37.519
(a name in history.)

00:16:38.279 --> 00:16:39.080
(December 25, 2018)
Professor Zeng.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.240
The topic

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.519
of our interview

00:16:41.759 --> 00:16:43.679
is an art master
who has gone through a fire.

00:16:44.039 --> 00:16:44.720
We've heard

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:46.240
you'll rebuild the studio.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.039
The same as the one before?

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:48.960
Yes.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.879
This is not creation.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.000
But I'm used

00:16:52.159 --> 00:16:53.399
to the way I worked before.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.679
I believe

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.480
you can surpass your past self.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:57.840
When people can't surpass

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:58.879
their past selves,

00:16:59.159 --> 00:17:00.600
it's not because of incapability,

00:17:01.799 --> 00:17:02.720
but the past will

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.000
hinder the future.

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:05.960
Past glories

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:07.920
will make people lazy

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:09.240
and insensitive.

00:17:09.519 --> 00:17:11.319
The first work that won me an award

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.079
was created when I was 20.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:14.079
Looking at it now,

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:15.440
there are many things

00:17:15.559 --> 00:17:16.720
to be perfected.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:18.359
But if I look at it

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.160
when I'm 70,

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:20.240
even 80,

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:21.799
perhaps I'll be satisfied,

00:17:22.519 --> 00:17:23.880
thinking the young self

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:26.960
sensitive, sharp, and energetic.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.480
Because I would be

00:17:29.599 --> 00:17:30.759
too old

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.279
to pain then.

00:17:35.119 --> 00:17:36.079
So, this fire

00:17:36.759 --> 00:17:38.000
helped me make up my mind.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:50.880
I'm heading back to town too.

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:52.576
I'll give you a ride.

00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:02.799
I'll go eat.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:03.839
And you?

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.599
I'll go home

00:18:06.799 --> 00:18:07.880
and make something to eat.

00:18:08.279 --> 00:18:08.960
You cook?

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:11.400
Dining outside

00:18:11.519 --> 00:18:12.640
costs too much.

00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:13.559
And

00:18:13.839 --> 00:18:14.839
I have a huge appetite.

00:18:15.599 --> 00:18:16.400
Which restaurant is

00:18:16.519 --> 00:18:17.119
your favorite?

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.599
A lot.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.160
I have a list here,

00:18:22.279 --> 00:18:23.519
with restaurants

00:18:23.599 --> 00:18:25.039
that I want to try so bad.

00:18:26.119 --> 00:18:26.839
Then navigate.

00:18:29.079 --> 00:18:29.799
Navigate?

00:18:30.279 --> 00:18:31.160
Where to?

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.200
A restaurant.

00:18:32.559 --> 00:18:33.400
Don't cook today.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.519
But these places are way too pricey.

00:18:35.599 --> 00:18:36.119
My treat.

00:18:40.079 --> 00:18:40.519
Please.

00:18:56.119 --> 00:18:57.160
(I shared a rental house,)

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.440
somewhere in the suburbs.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.640
Can't afford the city center.

00:19:01.079 --> 00:19:02.720
My place is old too.

00:19:03.359 --> 00:19:04.200
I keep thinking

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:05.559
once my internship ends,

00:19:06.079 --> 00:19:06.559
I'll try

00:19:06.759 --> 00:19:08.519
to move to a better house.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.960
Living with classmates?

00:19:11.039 --> 00:19:12.440
Yes, my classmate.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:14.599
But

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.240
she's on business trips.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.160
I just remembered

00:19:19.279 --> 00:19:20.519
I haven't paid her back

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.599
the rent I asked her

00:19:21.599 --> 00:19:22.319
to cover for me.

00:19:22.319 --> 00:19:24.064
(Available Credit: 2500. Borrow Money)

00:19:30.752 --> 00:19:32.448
(Zeng Jie Transferred 6,000 Yuan)

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.319
Professor Zeng.

00:19:35.519 --> 00:19:36.720
It charges interest.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.440
I won't.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.319
Just repay me later.

00:19:39.839 --> 00:19:40.640
No.

00:19:41.079 --> 00:19:42.359
I can't take this.

00:19:42.559 --> 00:19:43.000
Fine.

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:45.480
Then blacklist me.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.079
No way.

00:19:56.559 --> 00:19:56.960
Listen.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:58.559
Every month,

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.039
recommend me a new restaurant,

00:20:00.279 --> 00:20:01.319
and I'll treat you.

00:20:01.799 --> 00:20:03.440
But no repeats allowed for a year.

00:20:04.799 --> 00:20:05.279
Deal.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.519
But I'll definitely

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.960
repay you back.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:09.799
Okay.

00:20:10.839 --> 00:20:11.480
When you

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.160
earn more.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.119
Thank you.

00:20:21.519 --> 00:20:22.400
My phone died.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.039
Lend me a charger?

00:20:41.319 --> 00:20:41.839
We're here.

00:20:47.559 --> 00:20:49.279
Your phone...

00:20:51.759 --> 00:20:52.200
Thank you.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:05.880
Professor Zeng.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:06.880
Don't mind it.

00:21:07.279 --> 00:21:08.880
I've been working,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.279
couldn't tidy up properly.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:11.319
I should

00:21:12.319 --> 00:21:13.559
have tidied up before

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.680
inviting you over.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.720
You should say,

00:21:17.799 --> 00:21:18.759
'I'm very neat,

00:21:19.079 --> 00:21:20.400
but my roommate is messy.'

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.119
Right, it's her fault.

00:21:23.359 --> 00:21:24.319
Want to drink something?

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:25.200
Your interviews

00:21:25.359 --> 00:21:26.599
for artists are too niche

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.799
for general audiences.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.160
You should focus on finance topics.

00:21:32.799 --> 00:21:34.839
I know some

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.559
investors and fund managers
in Caorong City.

00:21:44.559 --> 00:21:45.720
You can think about it.

00:21:48.039 --> 00:21:49.680
Thanks, Professor Zeng.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.279
Professor?

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.000
I saw there's a charging cable

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:58.319
in your car.

00:22:02.079 --> 00:22:03.519
Why didn't you tell me?

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.240
I forgot it.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.039
Maybe

00:22:11.359 --> 00:22:12.279
that one was broken.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:20.960
Why

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.200
are you here?

00:22:23.079 --> 00:22:23.880
I don't know.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.960
I want to find my family.

00:22:27.079 --> 00:22:28.359
This is a world for living ones.

00:22:28.799 --> 00:22:30.039
You shouldn't be here.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.480
Anything you can't let go of?

00:22:32.799 --> 00:22:33.519
Who are you?

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.119
Why can't others see me,

00:22:35.319 --> 00:22:36.000
yet you can?

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.000
I'm

00:22:38.759 --> 00:22:39.640
a soul reaper.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.400
How's this series

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.119
performing lately?

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:57.640
Average.

00:22:57.839 --> 00:22:59.319
The content creators nowadays

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.279
don't innovate and can't innovate.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.519
Just copy what's trending.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.039
My current project is

00:23:04.359 --> 00:23:05.400
starting to get popular.

00:23:05.559 --> 00:23:06.279
Go search for it.

00:23:06.599 --> 00:23:08.079
There are many soul reapers already.

00:23:08.319 --> 00:23:09.000
Understood.

00:23:09.279 --> 00:23:09.839
Life is tough.

00:23:10.759 --> 00:23:11.440
Why call me out?

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.160
I recall you studied literature
at Caorong University.

00:23:15.799 --> 00:23:17.039
There's a professor

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:17.880
named Zeng Jie.

00:23:18.079 --> 00:23:18.599
Know him?

00:23:18.759 --> 00:23:19.640
Art college.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.039
He's some kind of ceramic master.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.359
You know him?

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:24.759
Sort of.

00:23:25.119 --> 00:23:26.079
He added me on WeChat.

00:23:26.599 --> 00:23:27.440
You added him?

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.480
But we barely talk.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.559
(Zeng Jie)
Why firecrackers after his name?

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:33.440
It's my note.

00:23:34.039 --> 00:23:34.640
It means?

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.440
What do firecrackers do?

00:23:36.559 --> 00:23:37.039
To explode.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:37.759
Exactly.

00:23:38.039 --> 00:23:39.000
Leave the creep alone.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.599
Creative.

00:23:42.279 --> 00:23:43.720
What's your note to me?

00:23:44.519 --> 00:23:46.400
Fool Big Hui.

00:23:47.599 --> 00:23:48.720
What a direct insult!

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:49.920
You should be grateful

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.519
that I didn't add a 'Super'

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.279
before that.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.519
It's already respectful.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.039
Why call him a creep?

00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:56.160
Think about it.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.799
I attended his class,

00:23:58.119 --> 00:23:59.880
he searched for me in the group chat

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:00.960
and added me.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.559
I need to check carefully.

00:24:02.559 --> 00:24:03.119
He hit on you?

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.039
He was holding

00:24:04.279 --> 00:24:05.160
an art exhibition.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.039
Before replying,

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.359
my roommate received

00:24:07.359 --> 00:24:08.400
the exact same text.

00:24:09.359 --> 00:24:10.119
What do you think?

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.400
He's a creep for sure.

00:24:12.119 --> 00:24:12.839
For real.

00:24:13.079 --> 00:24:13.880
I almost forgot.

00:24:14.039 --> 00:24:15.160
I have to delete him.

00:24:15.839 --> 00:24:16.400
Let me check

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.319
his moments feed.

00:24:18.519 --> 00:24:19.799
Too late, already deleted.

00:24:19.839 --> 00:24:21.000
Why are you so impulsive?

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:21.920
Not at all!

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:22.519
What?

00:24:22.519 --> 00:24:23.519
Why keep him?

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.319
What do you want?

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.160
Nothing. Want to know about him.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:28.160
He's

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.640
a young professor

00:24:29.839 --> 00:24:30.720
enjoying flirting,

00:24:31.119 --> 00:24:32.000
and a ceramic master

00:24:32.279 --> 00:24:33.440
enjoying being interviewed.

00:24:33.759 --> 00:24:34.640
That's all.

00:24:35.799 --> 00:24:36.519
How do you know he

00:24:36.559 --> 00:24:37.599
enjoys being interviewed?

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.640
I saw his posts are

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.599
all articles and interviews

00:24:41.599 --> 00:24:42.119
of himself.

00:24:42.319 --> 00:24:43.519
What a narcissist.

00:24:52.759 --> 00:24:53.480
Interview?

00:24:54.039 --> 00:24:54.880
Got an appointment?

00:24:55.319 --> 00:24:55.880
No.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.359
I want to capture an artist's

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.680
authentic state.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.640
He's on a business trip.

00:25:01.599 --> 00:25:02.279
Bad timing.

00:25:02.359 --> 00:25:03.200
When will he return?

00:25:03.519 --> 00:25:05.680
Probably three more days.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.440
So this is the kiln?

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:19.880
Yes.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:20.960
All our ceramics

00:25:21.119 --> 00:25:22.400
are fired here.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.920
Looks pretty high-tech.

00:25:27.319 --> 00:25:28.240
Computer-controlled.

00:25:28.559 --> 00:25:30.000
State-of-the-art system.

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.160
So you just put

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.519
the pieces straight in?

00:25:47.599 --> 00:25:49.160
Firing is the crucial step.

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:50.720
Temperature control matters.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.559
Professor Zeng is serious about this

00:25:52.759 --> 00:25:53.799
and always monitors

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:54.599
the temperature

00:25:54.799 --> 00:25:55.960
throughout the night.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:56.839
All night?

00:25:57.079 --> 00:25:57.680
That long?

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.000
He always says,

00:26:00.039 --> 00:26:01.680
'Every piece is hard-earned.'

00:26:02.839 --> 00:26:04.079
How many degrees

00:26:04.079 --> 00:26:05.079
can this kiln reach?

00:26:06.039 --> 00:26:06.960
Professor Zeng creates

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:07.880
high-fired ceramics,

00:26:08.119 --> 00:26:10.079
requiring temperatures
over 1,200 degrees.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.079
1,200 degrees?

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.759
Hot enough to turn everything to ashes.

00:26:18.519 --> 00:26:19.519
(It uses open flames,)

00:26:19.759 --> 00:26:20.920
(but all within the furnace.)

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.400
(The exterior's insulated with
fireproof asbestos,)

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:24.599
with only a few

00:26:24.599 --> 00:26:25.519
monitoring peepholes.

00:26:26.279 --> 00:26:27.559
The entire setup is safe.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.480
I heard your place

00:26:33.519 --> 00:26:34.440
had a fire before.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.119
That wasn't kiln-related.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.592
The charcoal brazier
on the second floor lit the sofa.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:39.920
The kiln wasn't damaged?

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:40.799
This thing

00:26:40.839 --> 00:26:42.000
can reach over 1,200 degrees.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.799
Professor is a perfectionist.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.279
He cherishes the kiln,

00:26:46.119 --> 00:26:46.559
and cannot

00:26:46.559 --> 00:26:47.480
tolerate any flaws.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.039
It's said

00:26:49.279 --> 00:26:51.240
Professor Zeng
can't stand blemish flaws.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.400
He's always pursued perfection.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.079
He demands perfection

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.400
in all his works?

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.359
He often says 'approaching perfection.'

00:26:59.759 --> 00:27:00.400
Approaching?

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:01.759
Exactly.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.319
(What we can do)

00:27:06.359 --> 00:27:07.640
(is approaching perfection.)

00:27:07.839 --> 00:27:09.000
Perfection is an aspiration.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.039
(You lack any aspirations.)

00:27:15.279 --> 00:27:15.799
Buddy,

00:27:18.079 --> 00:27:19.920
are there many girls

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.359
who admire Professor Zeng?

00:27:21.839 --> 00:27:22.480
Of course.

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.519
He's young and talented.

00:27:25.039 --> 00:27:25.559
Girls?

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.839
Which media outlet are you from?

00:27:29.279 --> 00:27:30.240
Just casual questions.

00:27:30.279 --> 00:27:30.759
Don't worry.

00:27:30.799 --> 00:27:31.240
Won't write

00:27:31.279 --> 00:27:32.599
such a story into the article.

00:27:33.519 --> 00:27:34.759
Professor Zeng has a wife,

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.160
and they are very devoted.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.079
But do many girls

00:27:38.079 --> 00:27:40.519
frequent his studio

00:27:40.519 --> 00:27:41.319
to do...

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:42.799
art projects?

00:27:56.079 --> 00:27:56.839
You can't come?

00:27:57.319 --> 00:27:58.720
Choose between Mahjong and him.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:00.519
You can't come?

00:28:00.559 --> 00:28:02.799
Just make it here now, fool.

00:28:10.839 --> 00:28:11.319
Sir,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.200
do you know Professor Zeng Jie?

00:28:14.559 --> 00:28:15.440
The kiln guy.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:16.680
Sure do.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.640
He's an art master.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.440
Nonsense.

00:28:19.599 --> 00:28:20.400
Kiln guy?

00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:21.759
He's a ceramic master.

00:28:22.039 --> 00:28:23.759
You know nothing.

00:28:24.319 --> 00:28:24.880
Listen.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.480
Last year his place caught fire,

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.920
burned everything to cinders.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.440
Nothing left at all.

00:28:29.519 --> 00:28:30.240
How terrifying.

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.039
Do you know why it burned?

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.319
Playing with fire daily,

00:28:33.559 --> 00:28:34.599
it leads to accidents.

00:28:34.599 --> 00:28:35.880
Don't listen to him.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.319
He's mentally ill.

00:28:37.359 --> 00:28:39.200
The fire department confirmed

00:28:39.359 --> 00:28:41.240
the charcoal brazier ignited the sofa.

00:28:42.519 --> 00:28:43.480
Your turn now.

00:28:43.519 --> 00:28:44.039
Nonsense.

00:28:44.119 --> 00:28:45.359
Does he usually

00:28:45.359 --> 00:28:45.920
stay here?

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.160
He stays here every day,

00:28:47.359 --> 00:28:48.359
even overnights.

00:28:48.519 --> 00:28:49.680
He has a wife,

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.319
yet never goes back.

00:28:51.759 --> 00:28:52.799
Suspicious, right?

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.119
Does he bring women here?

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.440
Every day.

00:28:57.039 --> 00:28:57.799
Frequently.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.240
He's got loads of students.

00:28:59.599 --> 00:29:00.279
It's natural

00:29:00.279 --> 00:29:01.839
that many are women.

00:29:01.839 --> 00:29:02.400
Right.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.599
Have you seen

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.000
what those women look like?

00:29:05.039 --> 00:29:05.640
Impressive.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.000
Both young

00:29:07.039 --> 00:29:08.160
and pretty.

00:29:08.319 --> 00:29:09.079
Nonsense.

00:29:09.079 --> 00:29:10.400
I've seen him bring someone here.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:11.720
Came by car.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.039
Not just once.

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:14.720
Sir, Madams.

00:29:14.759 --> 00:29:17.559
Have you seen this girl?

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.480
Sure do.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.599
They were both here this morning.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.720
Sir, you...

00:29:25.079 --> 00:29:26.359
Don't listen to him.

00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:28.160
He has a mind issue.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:28.799
Let me see.

00:29:31.559 --> 00:29:32.720
This is his wife?

00:29:32.799 --> 00:29:33.880
No.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.200
I recognize her.

00:29:35.759 --> 00:29:37.559
This is his housekeeper.

00:29:37.799 --> 00:29:39.480
She cleans and cooks.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:40.559
Nonsense.

00:29:40.599 --> 00:29:41.248
One Character.

00:29:41.839 --> 00:29:42.640
Three Character.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:46.920
Sir, Madams.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:47.759
Time to eat.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.599
- Time to eat.
- Time to eat.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:51.599
Let's eat.

00:29:51.599 --> 00:29:52.400
- Easy.
- Easy.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:54.599
Easy, easy.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:55.559
We're leaving.

00:29:57.319 --> 00:29:58.200
Thank you so much.

00:29:58.599 --> 00:29:59.839
Hadn't you kept them occupied,

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.119
they might have run around.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.039
They are...

00:30:03.839 --> 00:30:04.559
They're elderly,

00:30:04.839 --> 00:30:05.720
not that sharp.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.279
Thank you.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.200
You'd believe some muddled

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.200
old folks?

00:30:14.519 --> 00:30:15.319
Of course not.

00:30:15.359 --> 00:30:16.440
But I think they prove that

00:30:16.599 --> 00:30:17.720
Zeng Jie frequently brings

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.720
women to the studio.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:19.839
If he didn't do that,

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.000
these elderly folks

00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:21.599
would never

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.759
have such an impression.

00:30:23.039 --> 00:30:23.519
Wait.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.759
When investigating a case,

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.680
if a child contradicts

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:28.240
an adult,

00:30:28.319 --> 00:30:28.960
what to do?

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.319
If someone with

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.279
mental disorder

00:30:31.599 --> 00:30:32.279
contradicts

00:30:32.279 --> 00:30:32.839
a sane person

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:33.680
who do you trust?

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.119
Moreover,

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.119
when I dug deeper,

00:30:37.319 --> 00:30:38.240
his student

00:30:38.279 --> 00:30:39.359
got defensive instantly.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.799
This shows Zeng Jie

00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:41.920
is not that decent.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.640
Or his student won't be so vigilant.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.799
This is just your speculation.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.200
It is my speculation.

00:30:48.319 --> 00:30:49.559
You can challenge me.

00:30:52.519 --> 00:30:52.920
Fine.

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.359
Even if Zeng Jie is not

00:30:54.359 --> 00:30:54.839
that decent,

00:30:55.079 --> 00:30:56.640
and often brings women to the studio.

00:30:57.559 --> 00:30:58.559
How did you connect

00:30:59.319 --> 00:31:00.640
Zeng Jie and Liu Wei?

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.640
His student mentioned...

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.720
(He often says
'approaching perfection.')

00:31:06.039 --> 00:31:06.720
Wei said it too?

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:07.319
Exactly.

00:31:07.559 --> 00:31:08.599
What we can do

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.720
is approaching perfection.

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.680
After she made

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.720
that ceramic plate.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.039
I told you before about

00:31:17.079 --> 00:31:18.759
'Perfectionist' and 'Blemish Flaw'.

00:31:19.079 --> 00:31:20.799
Now another one,
'approaching perfection.'

00:31:21.119 --> 00:31:22.480
Just a common expression.

00:31:22.559 --> 00:31:23.279
Nothing special.

00:31:23.359 --> 00:31:24.640
It's a common expression.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:25.759
But think carefully,

00:31:25.799 --> 00:31:27.160
would you say it casually?

00:31:28.119 --> 00:31:30.079
This isn't evidence.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.240
I never claimed it is.

00:31:31.319 --> 00:31:32.279
Just my speculation.

00:31:34.079 --> 00:31:35.079
Good!

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.799
- Good!
- Good!

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.359
Two more beers.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.160
I don't drive.

00:31:39.799 --> 00:31:40.799
Let's discuss the fire.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:41.759
I've asked...

00:31:44.799 --> 00:31:45.480
Charcoal brazier?

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.440
So careless?

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.440
Professor Zeng's been cautious about

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.119
fire safety.

00:31:51.319 --> 00:31:52.519
That day he hosted a party

00:31:52.759 --> 00:31:53.880
with some friends.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:55.680
After his friends left,

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.119
he went to check the kiln

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.400
and stayed monitoring.

00:31:59.119 --> 00:32:00.519
He forgot to extinguish

00:32:00.599 --> 00:32:01.640
the charcoal brazier.

00:32:02.519 --> 00:32:03.079
In short,

00:32:03.319 --> 00:32:04.480
Professor was too focused

00:32:04.519 --> 00:32:05.799
on his works.

00:32:06.079 --> 00:32:07.559
The brazier ignited the sofa.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.279
Makes sense?

00:32:08.519 --> 00:32:09.720
It isn't a trash can.

00:32:09.759 --> 00:32:10.400
No one would

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:10.920
put it close

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.039
to the sofa.

00:32:12.119 --> 00:32:13.400
They were having a party.

00:32:13.599 --> 00:32:14.680
Someone must be sitting

00:32:14.839 --> 00:32:15.440
on the sofa.

00:32:15.559 --> 00:32:16.680
Why was the brazier close

00:32:16.759 --> 00:32:17.400
to the sofa?

00:32:17.839 --> 00:32:18.720
Someone must've

00:32:18.799 --> 00:32:19.720
moved it intentionally.

00:32:20.039 --> 00:32:20.480
By whom?

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.839
Who had the motive?

00:32:22.119 --> 00:32:23.960
Only Zeng Jie.

00:32:24.319 --> 00:32:26.319
(I heard Professor Zeng
built a new studio)

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.680
identical to the old one.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.720
Yes, he said he was used

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:30.960
to the original layout.

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.119
So everything here

00:32:33.119 --> 00:32:33.799
is brand new?

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:37.200
(I examined that layout
and asked his student.)

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.759
Even if the house burned down,

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:39.640
it wouldn't

00:32:39.839 --> 00:32:40.599
affect the kiln.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.200
Yet he still bought

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:42.839
a new one.

00:32:43.039 --> 00:32:43.680
I don't think

00:32:43.839 --> 00:32:45.559
he did it to pursue perfection,

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.720
but to eliminate evidence.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:48.880
This fire

00:32:49.079 --> 00:32:50.359
was to conceal a murder scene.

00:32:50.359 --> 00:32:51.570
- Good!
- Good!

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.559
So you mean...

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.119
(Zeng Jie killed Liu Wei)

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.920
(and put her body in the kiln.)

00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:58.759
(Then,)

00:32:59.039 --> 00:33:00.319
(he started the fire)

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:01.680
(to ruin evidence.)

00:33:01.839 --> 00:33:02.599
(The kiln)

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.079
can reach over 1,200 degrees.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.240
Such extreme heat

00:33:05.319 --> 00:33:06.400
could reduce a body

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.319
to utter ashes.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:08.920
But he took no chances.

00:33:09.319 --> 00:33:10.839
So he needed a fire

00:33:11.279 --> 00:33:13.200
to eliminate every evidence.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.079
The logic holds.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.200
I asked his student.

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:27.799
When the fire

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.119
broke out,

00:33:29.279 --> 00:33:30.319
Zeng Jie immediately

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.480
put on a fireproof mask

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:32.480
and a fire blanket

00:33:32.559 --> 00:33:33.079
in escape.

00:33:35.359 --> 00:33:37.359
And Zeng Jie brought

00:33:37.519 --> 00:33:38.400
these to the studio

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.319
just before the fire.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.559
Well-prepared.

00:33:43.359 --> 00:33:44.000
Well-planned.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:45.039
See?

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.319
You agree now?

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.119
But listen,

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:53.960
maybe all these

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.400
are just coincidences.

00:33:56.279 --> 00:33:57.079
You believe that?

00:33:57.839 --> 00:33:59.119
The brazier was near the sofa,

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.000
but not directly adjacent.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.799
They were using the brazier,

00:34:05.079 --> 00:34:06.480
so opened windows upstairs.

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:07.799
After everyone left,

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:09.559
a draft blew a blanket

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:11.360
onto the burning coals.

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:13.840
Buying a new kiln

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.159
because the old one
got damaged on the outside,

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:18.000
which would compromise
temperature control.

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.639
Zeng Jie demands perfection

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:20.559
in his works,

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:21.480
so

00:34:22.039 --> 00:34:23.000
he had to buy

00:34:23.079 --> 00:34:23.960
a new kiln.

00:34:26.519 --> 00:34:27.480
A month before the fire,

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.039
Zeng Jie was arranged to
attend a fire safety training

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.360
and demonstrate

00:34:31.519 --> 00:34:32.840
evacuation drills.

00:34:33.039 --> 00:34:33.639
After it,

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:35.480
he brought the fireproof equips

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.679
to the studio.

00:34:37.119 --> 00:34:38.719
If you're right,

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.199
the fire department

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:41.079
colludes with him?

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:42.760
Are you sure?

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:43.760
Yes.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.639
And do you know

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.280
how much

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.320
those burned works are

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:50.400
in his studio?

00:34:52.079 --> 00:34:53.320
Millions.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:55.840
Some are awarded works

00:34:56.039 --> 00:34:57.239
and ceramics to be done.

00:34:57.559 --> 00:34:58.239
If he did

00:34:58.239 --> 00:34:59.039
plan to do this,

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:00.159
why didn't he

00:35:00.199 --> 00:35:00.800
send them away?

00:35:02.519 --> 00:35:03.360
Your deduction

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:04.440
is quite convincing.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.840
There are detailed reports
on the Internet.

00:35:07.159 --> 00:35:08.920
I read them word for word.

00:35:09.159 --> 00:35:10.559
If anything's off, I'll notice it.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:13.519
Li De,

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:14.559
you missed

00:35:14.599 --> 00:35:15.239
a huge point.

00:35:15.239 --> 00:35:15.760
What is it?

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.079
Why did you read the reports

00:35:17.079 --> 00:35:17.920
word by word?

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:18.760
Because you...

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.000
That's because you are like me,

00:35:20.079 --> 00:35:21.639
believing Wei has vanished.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.760
She vanished too completely.

00:35:25.119 --> 00:35:26.360
It's very likely she's gone.

00:35:27.719 --> 00:35:29.000
The fire at Zeng Jie's studio

00:35:29.159 --> 00:35:30.280
happened in the same period

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.760
to Wei's disappearance.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:32.679
You also doubt

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.639
if Wei was killed by Zeng Jie.

00:35:37.239 --> 00:35:38.039
It is my deduction.

00:35:38.519 --> 00:35:39.639
I will keep looking into it.

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.199
You didn't let me drink last time.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.112
You're drinking now.

00:35:48.039 --> 00:35:48.840
I'll go to Zeng Jie

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.199
when he returns.

00:35:54.559 --> 00:35:56.199
Zeng Jie has motives to kill Liu Wei?

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:57.920
He has a wife.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:35:59.480
Having an affair,

00:35:59.639 --> 00:36:00.519
and he has to kill?

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.079
After all,

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.280
he has a bright future ahead.

00:36:05.239 --> 00:36:06.000
Killing

00:36:06.199 --> 00:36:07.760
by mistake or on impulse...

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.000
Countless possibilities.

00:36:09.559 --> 00:36:10.239
You sure

00:36:10.519 --> 00:36:12.039
Liu Wei is related to Zeng Jie?

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.000
Man!

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.400
Wei broke up with me
after knowing Zeng Jie.

00:36:16.519 --> 00:36:17.159
Why?

00:36:17.519 --> 00:36:18.599
I don't have aesthetics

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.280
to let her make ceramic plates?

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.800
In your opinion,

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:23.480
will she

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.079
force Zeng Jie to divorce?

00:36:26.679 --> 00:36:27.559
No idea.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:29.800
You know

00:36:30.239 --> 00:36:31.639
I wasn't in too deep

00:36:32.159 --> 00:36:33.079
with Wei.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.159
Big Hui.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:40.360
You loved her so much.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:41.880
Not really.

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:45.840
I almost forgot her.

00:36:48.519 --> 00:36:49.519
In fact, I already have.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.480
But I just realized suddenly

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:53.920
that she's not around me.

00:36:55.079 --> 00:36:55.840
If she

00:36:56.039 --> 00:36:57.119
suddenly appears,

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.000
I don't care if she's living well,

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:00.920
I'll leave

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.199
once I know she's fine.

00:37:06.199 --> 00:37:07.119
Drop me off ahead.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:08.440
What?

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:09.920
It's near my home.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:11.519
I had too much.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:12.760
Gonna take a walk.

00:37:23.519 --> 00:37:24.159
Your phone died.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.440
Go get a power bank.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.440
How? My phone's off.

00:37:26.719 --> 00:37:27.360
I shared

00:37:27.519 --> 00:37:28.599
my location with you.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.079
Your pin was way off.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.079
I'd never notice you

00:37:31.119 --> 00:37:32.280
if not for my sharp eyes.

00:37:32.599 --> 00:37:34.039
That's because I'm attractive,

00:37:34.039 --> 00:37:34.559
okay?

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:36.280
That's your problem.

00:37:36.719 --> 00:37:37.800
Sure.

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:39.960
Let's get this wig.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.119
Wear this,

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.320
and you'll be noticeable.

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:50.960
I look amazing.

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.119
I always look good.

00:37:52.559 --> 00:37:53.000
Exactly.

00:37:53.079 --> 00:37:53.880
You get one too.

00:37:54.559 --> 00:37:55.239
This one.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:01.760
Looks great.

00:38:04.519 --> 00:38:05.599
It's scary to think

00:38:06.079 --> 00:38:07.039
if we lose our phones,

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.440
we'd lose all connections,

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.079
like disappearing.

00:38:10.679 --> 00:38:11.280
No way.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.280
I'll always find you.

00:38:13.119 --> 00:38:13.920
How?

00:38:14.639 --> 00:38:15.559
What do I do?

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.119
Finding you would be easy.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.880
You're just a video editor.

00:38:20.079 --> 00:38:20.840
Do you think

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:21.800
you're a detective?

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:22.800
Anyway,

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.000
I can always find you.

00:38:26.039 --> 00:38:26.960
Are you insane?

00:38:27.039 --> 00:38:27.840
Pick a green one?

00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:30.079
You told me to.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.119
Don't wear it.

00:38:31.639 --> 00:38:32.280
Fine.

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:37.960
When we break up,

00:38:38.719 --> 00:38:40.159
you'll never find me again.

00:38:41.519 --> 00:38:42.280
If we break up,

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.599
I won't look for you.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:44.559
But if I do,

00:38:44.719 --> 00:38:45.760
I'll find you anywhere.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.440
Just try.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:48.480
Just try.

00:38:48.639 --> 00:38:49.159
Just try.

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:49.679
Try.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:50.440
Stop it!

00:38:50.639 --> 00:38:51.679
I'm sorry.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:00.440
Hello.

00:39:01.679 --> 00:39:02.320
You're back?

00:39:02.559 --> 00:39:03.280
That was quick.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:04.599
(Congratulations)

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.320
(for winning this competition.)

00:39:06.719 --> 00:39:08.079
(Please share with us)

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.000
(the concept)

00:39:09.119 --> 00:39:09.920
(of this work.)

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.559
(No chaos, no hesitation,)

00:39:11.719 --> 00:39:12.719
(no fear, no attachment.)

00:39:13.239 --> 00:39:13.960
Leave it here.

00:39:14.039 --> 00:39:14.760
I'll put it away.

00:39:15.719 --> 00:39:16.239
How's it?

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.519
While I was away, anything happened?

00:39:19.039 --> 00:39:20.079
Nothing special.

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:21.760
A reporter came by

00:39:22.039 --> 00:39:22.719
for an interview.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:23.400
Which agency?

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:24.480
Didn't tell me.

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.400
No appointment either.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:27.719
He wanted to know

00:39:27.719 --> 00:39:29.519
the daily life of you.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.199
Reporters nowadays

00:39:32.239 --> 00:39:33.079
are living toughly.

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.960
Think of such approach?

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.360
He left no contact,

00:39:36.639 --> 00:39:38.000
said to return later.

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.559
What's the interview about?

00:39:40.159 --> 00:39:40.960
Didn't mention.

00:39:41.159 --> 00:39:42.239
Just chitchat.

00:39:43.039 --> 00:39:44.480
He mentioned last year's fire.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:48.719
Fire?

00:39:57.039 --> 00:39:58.280
It's been a year.

00:39:58.920 --> 00:39:59.559
Why would anyone

00:39:59.599 --> 00:40:00.239
bring that up?

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.000
Then he's nosy,

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.079
asked if many women

00:40:03.079 --> 00:40:04.039
come visit you.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.560
What did you say?

00:40:07.159 --> 00:40:08.119
Nothing.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.000
Alright.

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.119
(Congratulations)

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.920
(for winning this competition.)

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.639
(Please share with us)

00:40:22.719 --> 00:40:23.480
(the concept)

00:40:23.679 --> 00:40:24.280
(of this work.)

00:40:25.039 --> 00:40:26.112
(No chaos, no hesitation,)

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.440
(no fear, no attachment.)

00:40:27.559 --> 00:40:28.559
(What do they represent?)

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.867
Come down together.

00:40:48.672 --> 00:40:49.330
Him?

00:40:51.424 --> 00:40:52.160
Okay, one more.

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:52.992
One more.

00:40:52.992 --> 00:40:56.640
I'll find out
where this thing came from.

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:57.920
Alright, cut!

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.928
After that fire, Wei vanished.

00:41:00.928 --> 00:41:02.816
The men nowadays...

00:41:03.232 --> 00:41:04.135
Unbelievable.

00:41:04.478 --> 00:41:05.440
Sorry.

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.304
What's wrong?

00:41:06.304 --> 00:41:08.064
No, no. I messed up my lines.

00:41:08.128 --> 00:41:10.928
He must've brought women to the studio.

00:41:10.928 --> 00:41:13.152
If he hadn't, they wouldn't...

00:41:13.781 --> 00:41:14.530
Sorry.

00:41:14.976 --> 00:41:17.792
See if you have seen this girl.

00:41:18.912 --> 00:41:19.392
Yes.

00:41:19.968 --> 00:41:21.792
They were here this morning.

00:41:21.792 --> 00:41:23.351
Sir, you...

00:41:26.016 --> 00:41:27.290
Say that again!

00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:28.160
What, you're scared?

00:41:29.632 --> 00:41:31.296
- Got that?
- The hit.

00:41:35.264 --> 00:41:36.827
Are you even a man?

00:41:37.476 --> 00:41:38.441
Say that again!

00:41:38.441 --> 00:41:39.620
You want to hit me?

00:41:41.856 --> 00:41:42.880
Whoa, I fell.

00:41:45.664 --> 00:41:48.640
If you hadn't come to us
for fire safety training,

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.748
I would never prepare them.

00:41:52.768 --> 00:41:54.912
You set fire every day.

00:41:54.912 --> 00:41:56.000
You're a pro.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.796
That's different.

00:41:58.002 --> 00:42:00.132
Fire brings destruction,

00:42:00.448 --> 00:42:01.888
I create art.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.728
I believe I'll create more
and better works in the future.

00:42:06.232 --> 00:42:07.517
Sorry.

00:42:08.672 --> 00:42:10.293
But I...

00:42:10.976 --> 00:42:12.164
Sorry.

00:42:16.384 --> 00:42:17.280
Let me tell you.

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.112
You...

00:42:19.744 --> 00:42:20.672
Excuse me.

00:42:20.672 --> 00:42:21.372
It's fine.

00:42:22.716 --> 00:42:24.160
I can't breathe.

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:25.088
I can't do it.

00:42:26.144 --> 00:42:28.367
You're good to go.

00:42:28.384 --> 00:42:31.978
♪So hypnotize before we pull the fight♪

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:34.400
Bai Xiaoling, listen.

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.928
Stop judging me
with your nouveau riche mindset.

00:42:37.312 --> 00:42:38.302
Today,

00:42:38.302 --> 00:42:39.881
aesthetics has value

00:42:39.881 --> 00:42:41.285
and art has value.

00:42:41.285 --> 00:42:43.535
My career, my value...

00:42:44.928 --> 00:42:45.856
Wait, that's wrong.

00:42:45.856 --> 00:42:47.392
My career, my achievements...

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:49.553
Clear now?

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:52.945
Maybe

00:42:54.688 --> 00:42:55.647
that one was broken.
