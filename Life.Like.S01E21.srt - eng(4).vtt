If the wound isn't treated right,
it'll get infected.

Does it hurt?

Yeah.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.200

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.580

How did you end up getting caught?

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.360

Du Hongyue's shipment
for the higher-ups.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.560
Yamamoto and his men

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.840
are going to the Chamber
of Commerce for medicine.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.440
If you ask me,

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.720
that's their real objective.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.040
Hey, brother.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.440
Can I get a sip of water?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.240

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.280

Captain Luo wants some water.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:29.840
Give it to him.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.720
Didn't you say you wanted water?

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.480
Come on, drink.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.000
Hey.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.320
Up here.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.480
Come on, drink.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.280
Drink.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:50.880
Nah, you can't have it.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.520
Hey.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.320
I can't reach it, brother.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.400
You can't reach it?

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.280
Look.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.600
Open the door.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.440
Just a sip.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.200
Wait here.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.480
Drink.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.160

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.640
You didn't come to

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.280
make me carry all this stuff and

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.720
stand here talking to you, did you?

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:07.800
Oh.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:08.760
Come in.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.600
Don't be so nervous.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.920
I'm here to see Rose.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.400
Where is she?

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.600
Grocery shopping.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:38.840
What are you standing for?

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.600
Sit down.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.600
I'm not going to eat you.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.560

Man Li.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.560
No, thank you.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.680
You really love Xu.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.520
You take care of her.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.040
You protect her.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.440
you treat her badly,

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.320
I will never stop haunting you.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.600

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.400
(They two have made up?)

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.360
I'm back.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.160
stay for lunch.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.160
I'll cook.
