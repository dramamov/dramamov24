00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.880
(Viewer discretion is advised.)

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.800
The moment I saw those bodies,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.320
I got chills all over.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.960
In all my years as a cop,
I’ve never seen anything like this.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.760
Maybe it has something to do with spirits.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.080
If you didn’t do it, then who did?

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.200
Ghosts.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.280
The ghosts did it.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.160
I’ve signed the order to form
a special investigation team.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.200
You’ve been appointed as the team leader.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.720
I’ll find the real killer as fast as I can.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.120
The exact time of death can’t be determined yet.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.600
So the one who’ll handle this case

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.800
must be our top investigator in the unit.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.280
That’ll be all for the preliminary interview.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.000
Please wait for official updates
from the police only.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.240
Thank you. Thank you.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.880
Yes, sir.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.720
What do you mean, Commander?

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.400
Since the news has already leaked,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.200
the central office wants our division

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.000
to close this case as soon as possible.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.400
So they sent Inspector King to assist.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.280
But I think this case

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.720
our own division can handle it ourselves.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.080
No need for outsiders to interfere.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.400
It’s an order from headquarters.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.680
There’s nothing I can do.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.520
Hey, please,

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.400
I know you two have issues,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.400
but I want you to work together

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.560
and finally close this case.

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:33.920
We clear?

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.400
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.840
Yes, sir.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.280
Hope you’ll cooperate like the Commander asked.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.360
Someone like me always works professionally.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.400
Not like some people.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.200
And who’s this?

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.400
A suspect?

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.759
No.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.280
The only witness in this case.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.520
Right.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.920
Then as the head of
this special investigation team,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.560
I’m calling an immediate meeting.

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:31.880
Should I wait outside then?

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.960
No need.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.920
Aren’t you afraid of ghosts?

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.000
Stay right here with me.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.760
(Singsala Tai)

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.360
Uh... you can let go of my hand now.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.680
If you weren’t the head of
this special investigation team, P’Singha,

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.320
would I have been framed for the case?

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.600
No way.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.760
If you did nothing wrong,

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.480
you’ve got nothing to fear.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.600
I trust you, P’Singha.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.400
But I don’t trust other cops.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.080
As long as I’m still on this team,

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.480
I won’t let anyone harm you.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.800
Thank you.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.560
You’re much kinder than I thought, P’Singha.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.680
That’s not called kindness.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.360
It’s called pity.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.200
Call it whatever you want.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.440
As long as you help me,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.680
and let me stay with you.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.000
Go sit down.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.760
Okay, sir.

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:57.520
I’ll be right back.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.440
Yes, sir.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.000
P’Sing.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.840
Oh?

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.240
Did King call you in?

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.680
Where’s Darin?

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.600
He’s sick, bro.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.080
I’m flying solo today.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.560
You okay with all this, though?

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.320
About what?

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.200
About King, of course.

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:36.560
He’s the new team leader replacing you, right?

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.000
So what if I’m not okay?

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.400
It’s the Commander’s order,
and it’s already announced publicly.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.440
I can work with anyone, man.
I’ve got no problem with that.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.280
As long as King doesn’t pull
the same stunt again.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.560
Hmm.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.480
Have the lab results come out yet?

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.080
All done, bro.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.720
Good.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.600
We can report to the new chief now.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.880
(Witness)

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.840
We now have the names of all seven victims.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.480
- What connects the seven?
- What connects the seven?

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.400
So, is there any link among these seven people?

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.520
We can start digging from that point.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.760
That’s exactly the problem, sir.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.320
What do you mean, Mek?

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.200
All seven of them,

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.760
their age, jobs, surroundings, and families,

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.400
nothing connects them at all.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.200
Nothing connects them?

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.600
Then what’s the victims’ motive?

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.600
Or maybe the killer chose randomly.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.800
Whoever’s unlucky just dies.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.240
And that witness you found at the scene,

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.680
what did they tell you?

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.159
Not much.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.920
Still questioning them.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.400
Still questioning?

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.360
You’ve had him for a whole day.
Still got nothing?

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.840
Fine, I’ll handle the interrogation myself.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.160
No need. I’ll do it myself.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.200
- Sey.
- Yes, sir.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.800
What’s the estimated time of death?

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.480
Each victim died one day apart, sir.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.480
The killer murdered one person per day.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.000
But they were all hung on the tree at once?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.080
That’s our current assumption, sir.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.680
And who was the latest victim?

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.880
Number six, P’Sing.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.520
Mr. Phakaphong, the transgender victim.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.280
He died on the same day we found
the bodies at the abandoned mall.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.680
(24 hours)

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.880
Then we should start with this one.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.960
He’ll likely give us the most leads to follow.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.120
Agreed.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.800
Everyone,

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.480
head to the field.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.200
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, Inspector.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.720
Glad to be working with you again, man.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.200
You still dare to say that?

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.280
(Two years earlier)

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.200
Calm down, man.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.400
I said calm down!

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:40.320
I never should’ve listened to you.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.480
I never should’ve trusted you, King.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.280
The guy’s already dead.
What do you want me to do, huh?

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.000
The man you arrested,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.080
he killed himself from the pressure!

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.880
He wasn’t the culprit.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.800
He was innocent.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.920
You’re wrong, Singha.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.880
It wasn’t just me who
arrested him, it was both of us.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.360
I’m sorry.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.160
I’m sorry, Sing.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.480
But there’s nothing I can do now.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.320
Can’t you just wait a little?

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.680
Let the Commander handle this damn mess.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.280
You don’t have to say anything.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.960
I can take responsibility for what I did.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.760
You, the good guy, can take all the credit.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.680
P’Sing. P’Sing!

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.480
- Stop, P’Sing. Enough!
- You bastard!

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.840
- That’s enough, Inspector. Calm down!
- Come on, then!

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.560
Please calm down, don’t fight.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.000
I trusted you all along, King.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.160
I’ve always trusted you.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.880
Let this end here.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.960
You and I won’t work together again.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.080
Earth, have you seen Thup?

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.400
Thup? Oh, the witness
who saw the ghost, right, Inspector?

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.040
No, sir, I haven’t.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.360
Damn it, where’d he go?
I told him to wait.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.960
Oh, sorry!

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.720
Where the hell were you?

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.800
I went to buy some food, sir.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.960
And why didn’t you tell me?

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.960
I asked another officer,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.320
and they said you were in a tense meeting.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.400
So I went to get you something to eat.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.400
I bought some for you too, P’Singha.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.920
You haven’t eaten anything yet.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.240
Here, I tried to pick something quick to eat,

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.400
so it won’t slow you down from work.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.360
Come on, eat something.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.160
It’s soft and bouncy.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.040
Why do you even care about me?

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.880
You should care about yourself too, sir.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.480
You have to catch the killer for me.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.920
And for everyone else, too.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.560
Next time, tell me where you’re going.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.000
Don’t just wander off like that.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.360
You’re the only witness, Thup.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.880
If you disappear,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.120
it all becomes my responsibility.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.760
I don’t want trouble because of you.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.120
I’m not going anywhere, sir.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.680
I’ll just stay here and wait for you.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.360
No need to wait. You’re coming with me.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.480
Where are we going?

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.320
We just got back.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.960
We’re going to investigate the case.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.120
Or do you want to stay here alone?

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.960
Well, if P’Singha’s out helping people,

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.000
how could I just sit here and do nothing?

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.880
Eat first, okay?

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.880
I’m eating.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.120
Hurry up.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.080
(Please keep clean.)

(Sey)

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.520
What is it?

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.760
It’s noon already. You’re still asleep?

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.440
It’s my day off, man.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.480
I can wake up whenever I want.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.080
Get up and come in now, urgent.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.920
Sey!

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.360
You might be my department head,

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.520
but you can’t call me in
on my day off like this.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.120
It’s not work-related.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.440
Just wake up and check your messages.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.520
(Inspector King appointed to lead
investigation in seven-body ritual case.)

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.720
Shit.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.760
Where are you, man?
When are you coming in?

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.280
Sey!

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.600
I swear, King coming back is a bad omen.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.320
Or maybe I’m just cursed
by this ritual killing case.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.840
Wait here. I’ll be right back.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.600
Yes, sir.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.920
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.800
P’Sing, please wait a bit.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.800
Meen’s relatives will open the house for us.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.040
Inspector.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.320
I think we should wait for Meen’s relatives

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.000
to act as witnesses before entering the house.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.000
What do you say?

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Go in now or wait for the witness?

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.960
We’re racing against time.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.720
The Commander made us the special team.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.360
If anything happens,
Inspector King can… handle it.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:52.960
Right, Inspector?

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.320
You’re still the same, man.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.080
Still as reckless as ever.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.320
Inspector.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.000
Excuse me, is anyone inside?
This is the police.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.000
We need your cooperation.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.800
Help me!

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.480
The file’s inside the drawer.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.119
Put it on the table.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.480
Inspector.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.319
The victim was a transgender person.

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:28.800
Forensics said she had just
undergone gender-affirming surgery.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.280
Why are there no family photos at all?

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.840
Only friends came to claim the body, sir.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.680
Not every family can accept it

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.640
when they wished for a son,

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.480
but got a daughter instead.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.800
(Dhamma Practice Witthaya School)

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.880
Inspector.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.320
I think the smell’s coming from this room.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:30.400
It’s the strongest here.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.040
Shit... what the hell is this?

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.680
Blood.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.520
Looks like some kind of ritual symbol.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.200
Lieutenant.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.640
Send our informant to find out
what this symbol means.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.920
Seems like the victim got
involved in black magic.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.280
Yes, Inspector.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.160
Mek, call the forensics team for me.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.360
Yes, sir.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.040
(Police Forensics Division)

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.880
The documents, Father.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.920
What?

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.680
You’re bringing honorary witnesses along now?

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.480
Thup.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.080
What are you doing here?

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.320
This way, sir.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.040
What?

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.000
This way.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.480
Anything else I need to sign?

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.640
No, sir.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.000
Meen left home almost ten years ago.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.000
Ever since he told his father he wanted surgery.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.160
And one more thing,

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.480
if Meen had any debts whatsoever,

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.680
I won’t take any responsibility for them.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.000
Mr. Meen transferred everything to you.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.200
Including the house
and all the money in his accounts.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.920
Singha, wait.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.080
What?

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.160
I’ve been thinking about it.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.520
One way or another, you and I
still have to work this case together.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.760
It’ll take a while before we can close it.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.480
Maybe we should call a truce first.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.760
And if possible,

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.840
I’d like us to go back to how we used to be.

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.080
Stop shutting me out, man.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.280
Can’t we just let the past be the past?

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.880
We used to be close, didn’t we?

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.520
So how about this, today,

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.080
come have dinner with me.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.560
Invite Sey and Darin too.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:36.960
No need.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.200
Don’t act like you feel guilty
and want to make up with me.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.520
I’m only on this team
because of the Commander’s order.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.080
I’ll finish this case as soon as possible.

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.200
Then you and I won’t
have to see each other again.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:57.800
Thup.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.480
Go home.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:04.840
Thup.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:06.960
Yes, sir.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:33.640
Thup.

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.200
Thup.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.560
Thup.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.080
- Y... Yes?
- What’s wrong?

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.760
Nothing, sir.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.080
Buckle up.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.680
So, are you going to tell me yet,

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.640
how you knew Meen hid the will?

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.680
I happened to see it, sir.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.520
What do you mean?

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.800
If I tell you, you’ll scold me again.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.680
Just say it.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.560
Meen told me, sir.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.720
The dead man told you?

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.000
You and Inspector King seemed close before.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.880
But when you’re together,
the air feels tense somehow.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.000
Did you two have problems?

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.600
You don’t need to know that.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.200
Just know that he and I
are temporary coworkers, that’s all.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.600
Once this case is over...

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.600
he can go back to wherever he came from.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.520
Didn’t expect him to come here himself, sir.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.480
You could’ve just summoned me instead.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.480
It’s nothing serious.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.920
I just came to see how our new
special task force leader is doing.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.200
How far along the case is.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.720
Have you identified any suspects yet?

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.080
Yes, sir.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.920
Inspector King

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.800
is actively leading the investigation.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.760
He’s currently working on-site
with the original team.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.200
We expect progress within a few days.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.200
To be honest,

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.760
I’m not very confident
in your former team leader.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:53.920
Hmm?

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.000
But Singha

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.520
is the head of the investigation team

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:03.200
and one of the most skilled we’ve ever had.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.560
You know as well as I do,
this case doesn’t need skill.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.000
It needs obedience.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.760
That’s exactly why I sent King

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.280
from headquarters to handle it here.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.160
Let’s be frank, Commander,

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.800
if this case drags on too long,

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.400
you won’t be the only one in trouble.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.360
I’ll be dragged down with you.

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.400
So...

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.760
Do whatever you have to do.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.360
Just make sure your men cooperate.

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:45.680
I believe you don’t want
to see him transferred again.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.720
Right?

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:51.880
Yes, sir.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.040
Ever since we examined those seven bodies,

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.520
we’ve been cursed with bad luck, don’t you think?

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.960
I’ve got something for you to check out.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.120
Scroll through this.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.480
Whoa.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.400
This looks exactly like what we found.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.920
Yeah.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.480
I’ve been wondering

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.000
if something like this ever happened before.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.320
So I asked a friend from
forensics in another province.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.920
And I found these cases.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.880
They’re identical.

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.640
Especially the red threads sewn on the bodies.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.080
Where did this happen?

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.520
Chiang Mai, five years ago.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.880
That confirms it.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.920
This is clearly a black magic ritual case.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.440
It’s called a serial murder case.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.080
When we went to Meen’s house,

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.520
I saw a spirit at the second-floor window.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.760
It didn’t look like a household spirit.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.200
Not this again.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:29.360
I know you’re gonna say I’m crazy again.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.520
But I think...

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.760
I should tell you about it.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.520
Hmm.

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:42.680
The spirit I saw seemed like it
wanted to say something.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.720
Say something?

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.520
You’re telling me that
ghost wanted to talk to you?

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.400
I’m not really sure.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.640
Because when you arrested me,

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.320
all the spirits just disappeared.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.760
So it was all useless then.

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.680
And stop talking like I’m some holy figure.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.640
How could ghosts vanish because of me?

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.160
Not just because of you.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.280
But because of Him.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.800
Thao Wessuwan.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.640
He’s protecting you.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.680
That’s why spirits don’t dare come near you.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.440
And also...

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:30.240
your tiger and ixora tattoos,

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.880
they guard and protect you too.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.280
If you don’t believe,

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.360
then why do you have
Thao Wessuwan and those tattoos?

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.800
I got the tattoo to make everyone feel at ease,

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.880
not because I believe or not.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.520
And another thing,

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.240
stop touching me.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:55.520
Otherwise, I’ll start thinking
you’d rather touch me than the tattoo.

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:01.040
Why on earth would
I want to touch you, P'Sing?

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:04.440
I just wanna stay close so I don’t see ghosts.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.760
Not because I wanna touch you or anything.

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.080
You’re acting suspicious.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.280
So tell me,

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.640
are you staying with me...

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.400
for some other reason?

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.480
Don’t use ghosts as an excuse.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.800
I’m not.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.120
But can you stop teasing me now?

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.960
- You, huh?
- Ouch!

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.000
If you wanna stay in my house,
watch your mouth.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.720
Ow! My cheek’s all stretched out.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:38.880
Inspector!

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.760
Ow! P'Singha!

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:42.000
P'Sing!

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.160
I found a lead in the case.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.880
So...

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.760
you really saw a ghost?

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.200
Yes.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.520
Don’t believe him.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.480
He just says whatever comes to mind.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.040
There’s no proof of anything.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:06.080
Could be hallucinations, or maybe...

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.320
some kind of chemical in his brain.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.760
Has he ever had a check-up?

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.880
Science might be able to explain it, you know.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.200
Thup.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.760
Go find something to do for now.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.400
I’ve got business to discuss.

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.120
Not about the witness.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:22.920
Yes.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.080
Nice to meet you.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.800
The reason I let him stay here

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.360
is for his own safety.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.160
But still...

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.800
you really let him stay at your house?

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.320
Are you sure that’s wise?

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.680
If people find out,

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.360
it’ll be hard to explain.

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.520
At first, I was gonna let him go his own way.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:00.280
But I don’t want things
to end up like two years ago.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:05.800
Now that the public’s watching,
the case is being pushed to close fast.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.600
Who knows,

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.360
if we don’t find the culprit in time...

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.440
Thup might end up being the unlucky one.

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.920
You’re worried that,

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.480
Thup could be framed again, aren’t you, P'Sing?

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.520
Yeah.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.560
Thup’s the only witness

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.520
who was at the scene.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.400
I can’t take chances.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.480
Because Inspector King’s back on the case, right?

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.080
That’s why you’re scared.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.120
Yeah.

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.240
Who knows,

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.560
history might just repeat itself.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.800
Forget it.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:53.960
So what about you two?

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.480
What brings you here?

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.800
It’s about the case, P'Sing.

00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.520
I called but you didn’t answer.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.200
So we came instead.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:22.000
There was a similar case in Chiang Mai, P'Sing.

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:24.000
Same traces on the body,

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.120
same setup at the scene.

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.639
Where’d you get that from?

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.320
Asked some friends in forensics, P'Sing.

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:32.840
And this case,

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.080
what do we have in the forensic records?

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.239
In the hospital system,

00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:40.600
there’s a record of a body sent for autopsy

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:43.360
packed the same way, five years ago.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.880
They ran environmental DNA tests

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.440
and checked the suspects.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.080
But...

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.360
they never caught the killer.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:56.199
Who else knows about this data?

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.560
You’re the first person I told.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.480
But I’ll have to report it
to the bureau tomorrow.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.280
I’m afraid...

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.960
it might be a serial killer.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.520
Give me some time.

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.000
Don’t send it to the bureau yet.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.720
Commander Yuth won’t listen.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.520
He’s rushing to close the case.

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.480
Because of that mall construction deal.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.000
So what’s your plan?

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.760
I’ll reach out to the local police first,

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.760
see if they’ve got any info or evidence left.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.640
Maybe Sey’s theory

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.200
lines up with Thup’s after all.

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.680
What theory?

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.440
Thup.

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:42.880
Thup.

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.640
Yes.

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:55.440
Do you remember the ritual
for feeding spirits?

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.480
The one you told me about.

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.080
Tell me again, in detail.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:04.800
I saw it once with my own eyes.

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:09.360
Back when I was with
the Grandmaster Monk in Sisaket.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:12.560
Don’t go near the ritual for feeding spirits.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.600
It’ll let the spirits eat your head.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.560
Stay here.

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:25.080
(Sisaket, 2010)

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.720
Creepy.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.920
That place looks awful.

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.640
- It’s okay.
- So scary.

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.760
Don’t talk about it.
The guy’s already dead.

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.880
But I saw something that day.

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.640
What did you see?

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.640
There was like...

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.360
some kind of yantra symbol there.

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.600
Like this?

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.720
Exactly. Just like this.
It was on the ground.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.360
The Grandmaster Monk said it
was a yantra to summon spirits.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.240
Shit.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.480
Gave me chills.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.120
Sing.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.160
Where did you get this photo?

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.520
From the victim’s house.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.760
Get home safe. It’s late.

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.400
You don’t need to worry about us.

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.000
Worry about yourself.

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:53.920
What?

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:57.480
Be careful, from cop and witness

00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:00.080
you might turn into cop and keeper of the heart.

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:03.520
What kind of line is that? Makes me wanna puke.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:06.640
I wasn’t talking to you.
I was talking to P'Singha.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.320
Stop it, Darin.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.080
That’s nonsense.

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:13.440
I’m not involved with that kid.

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.000
And what I did

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.560
was all about work.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.120
If it were me,

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.960
I wouldn’t say something I’m not sure of.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.600
You.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.280
You.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.600
Darin has a point.

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:30.280
I want to finish the case

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.200
and get him out of the house fast.

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.600
But right now there’s no one else.

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.400
I may be harsh,

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.960
but not heartless.

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:43.280
Now you want to push him away,
but later will you hold him back?

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.480
I’ll strangle you first, Darin.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.000
Come on, P'.

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:48.800
Whoa.

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:52.600
I don’t mess with subordinates
who are also your ex.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.120
Alright, I’m heading out.

00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.960
If the local police send you anything,

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.520
forward it to me too.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.520
So I’ll know what to do next.

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.600
Forensics is hitting a wall.

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.120
Okay.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:09.040
Drive safe.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.520
Yes, P'.

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.880
Bye-bye.

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.000
You opened that for me?

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:30.680
Oh, it’s just my body’s automatic system.

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:35.800
Yeah, no need to do that.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.120
No “friends with benefits” ever

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.200
opens the car door like that.

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.320
We’re not lovers anymore anyway.

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.800
Hey.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.600
What we just saw,

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.800
was P'Singha about to do something to Thup?

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.080
No.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.080
He can tell things apart.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:02.320
But not everyone can separate everything.

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.880
Singha looks tough,

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:08.200
but you know how soft he is
with people close to him.

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.040
Yeah, true.

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.400
So...

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.480
you taking me straight to the condo?

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.720
Tonight,

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.640
can I crash at your place?

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:23.120
It’s late, I don’t feel like going home.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.520
Sure.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.880
But you’re sleeping on the couch.

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.480
Yeah, anywhere’s fine.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.000
Just don’t come asking to sleep with me.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.240
Contact Chiang Mai Police Station.

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.720
Report to me at the station tomorrow.

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:52.960
Yes.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.600
Don’t spread the word yet.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.160
I want to be sure first.

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.600
Okay.

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.280
Thup.

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.480
I just went to see my friends off.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.640
You fell asleep already?

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.400
I saw a spirit at the second-floor window.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.440
It didn’t look like a household ghost.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.840
Man, you’re such a heavy sleeper.

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.280
You really have no clue, do you?

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:36.800
Are you asleep or playing dead, huh?

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.640
- What are you doing, Thup?
- Changing the light bulb, sir.

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.800
P'Singha, please have a seat.

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:35.280
I’ve prepared rice porridge
and fresh orange juice for you.

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:43.720
You’ve been here two days
and act like you own the place.

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.040
I just bought it for you, that’s all.

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.920
I haven’t touched your kitchen, honest.

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.600
I was afraid you’d be bothered.

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:51.800
You can eat now.

00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.400
And also...

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:00.720
Here.

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:03.480
What is it?

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.200
Well...

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:08.280
I’ll buy you meals every day.

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:10.400
Consider it daily rent.

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.120
You’re clever, you know that.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:17.000
My house is not for rent.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.400
And even if it were,
it wouldn’t be that cheap.

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:24.000
But I have no money.

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.720
What can I do?

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:29.600
But the sincerity of a tenant like me

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.880
can’t be measured by money.

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:40.720
Alright then.

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.240
You want to stay at my place, right?

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.440
Mm.

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.720
You don’t have to pay rent.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.160
And don’t buy me food.

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:55.400
Just help me investigate
the seven bodies under the tree.

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.120
No, P'.

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:05.160
I don’t wanna keep running into ghosts.

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.720
Can I just...

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.320
stay here and give you information instead?

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:10.600
No.

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:14.040
That’d make you an uncooperative witness.

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:16.200
Come on, P'.

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:20.640
Honestly, you’ve got no choice, Thup.

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.680
Because in your eyes,

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:27.920
I’m the one who can drive spirits away, right?

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:32.800
Go change your clothes.

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:36.000
P'Singha, can you think outside the box first?

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.960
Maybe there’s another way

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:42.240
I can help you without
going to that creepy place.

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:47.160
- Get up.
- Ouch!

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.800
Hurry up and change, now!

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.280
- Don’t drag your feet.
- Ow!

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:52.160
Stop stalling.

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:56.880
The spirit I saw,

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:59.680
it’s not some brain chemical like Sey said.

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:02.360
Ghosts are really scary.

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.640
You better change nicely.

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:10.120
Or should I change it for you?

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:17.360
I can change myself.

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:31.640
(A case with similar patterns)

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:33.400
Hey.

00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:41.160
Our witness.

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:43.360
He knows about the spirit rituals and strange

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:45.440
yantras we found at the victim’s house.

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:48.800
So I thought you should
hear him out, might be useful.

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:52.280
Makes sense, I’ve seen you two
sticking together lately.

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:55.080
If I didn’t know he used to be a suspect,

00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.920
I’d think...

00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:58.240
What?

00:46:58.240 --> 00:46:59.400
Think what?

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:00.640
Friends.

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:02.320
Friends or something like that.

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:05.800
Then just think of him

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:09.320
as a temporary spiritual consultant.

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:12.000
And tell the document team

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.680
to send him a confidentiality agreement

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:16.200
to sign.

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:17.760
Got it.

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:19.080
But...

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:22.280
that position actually sounds necessary.

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:26.200
After all, two heads are better than one.

00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:28.960
You...

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:31.520
And the Chiang Mai data I asked for?

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.320
Just as you predicted, P'.

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:34.720
This way.

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:40.800
Here.

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:44.880
Besides what happened
in Chiang Mai five years ago,

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:48.960
we also found a similar case
in Phang Nga ten years ago.

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.840
So in total, there are three locations.

00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.680
Phang Nga,

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.000
Chiang Mai,

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.680
and Bangkok.

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:13.280
No.

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:15.560
Actually, four.

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.480
Thup saw something like that as a kid.

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:19.360
When he was in Sisaket.

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:21.080
How many years ago was that?

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:23.560
About fifteen years ago.

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.560
Fifteen years in Sisaket.

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:28.520
Ten years in Phang Nga.

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:30.320
Five years in Chiang Mai.

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:31.840
And now, Bangkok.

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:35.280
Could the killer be committing mass
murders every five years?

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:39.400
So there might be another site
we haven’t found yet?

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:41.440
It’s possible.

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:43.480
But let’s not jump to conclusions.

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:46.120
Focus on Chiang Mai and
Phang Nga first, since we have data.

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:49.680
But if we look too far back,

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:52.120
I think the data hasn’t
synced to the main system yet.

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:56.320
There should only be hard-copy
records left in each area.

00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:59.160
I think we’ll have to check the sites ourselves.

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:01.480
Then send your team to the field.

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:03.440
Got it.

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:06.840
Should I report this to Inspector King?

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:08.280
No need.

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:11.240
Just focus on collecting the information.

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:14.080
As for the operations
or reporting to the Commander,

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:15.760
I’ll handle that myself.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.320
Alright, I’ll get going then.

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.480
Oh, P'.

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:28.360
Where are you going?

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:29.880
To see the Commander.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.320
Uh... will you be long?

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:35.960
I don’t feel so good.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.400
I don’t really want to be alone right now.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.520
Take a photo.

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:46.880
You said it keeps ghosts away, right?

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:50.120
If one shows up,
use it as a talisman for now.

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:54.600
Hurry up.

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:10.480
P'.

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:13.160
What now?

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:16.000
I forgot my bag.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.520
Can I borrow some paper
from your room to draw?

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.120
Sure.

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:33.080
Is something wrong?

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.160
I can come back later.

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:37.520
- You can wait until the Commander’s free.
- Oh, no, it’s fine.

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:40.480
We’re just discussing
the seven bodies under the tree case.

00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:42.120
If you’ve got something, say it.

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.680
I found an old report file.

00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:46.680
It shows similar cases
happened in other provinces.

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:48.440
Both Chiang Mai and Phang Nga.

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:53.040
So this has happened in two areas already?

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.560
It might’ve spread to even more regions.

00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:59.040
Including Bangkok , that makes three now.

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:02.200
While you were in the meeting with the Commander,

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:04.520
I already sent my team out to investigate.

00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:09.440
This is huge.

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:13.120
If this turns out to be a serial murder case,

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.120
the media will tear us apart.

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:20.200
Wait, why didn’t you inform Inspector King?

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:21.960
He’s the team leader.

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:26.040
I figured the Commander
wants this case closed fast.

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:29.480
So spreading out the investigation
for quicker results

00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.320
would be more effective.

00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:32.960
Even so,

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:35.480
you’re still bypassing the chain of command.

00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:37.360
You understand what I mean, right?

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:39.960
I understand. I’m sorry, sir.

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:43.800
I’m sorry, Commander.

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.960
But I trust Inspector Singha.

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:47.880
I believe he’s doing his best.

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:50.400
So I’m not too concerned about the procedure.

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:52.840
As long as it helps move the case forward,

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:56.320
a good officer will always give his all.

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:01.000
Hmm... well then,

00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:03.600
we’ll go with what Inspector King suggested.

00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:05.680
But next time,

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:09.160
I want everything done by the book.

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:11.560
Yes, sir.

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:15.760
Still, while we continue the investigation,

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:17.920
I think we should ease the pressure

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:20.040
and reduce the fake news spreading online.

00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:23.240
I might have a solution that benefits everyone.

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:26.240
What solution?

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:30.080
Don’t forget, Commander, we do have a witness.

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.880
And he’s the only one.

00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:35.400
For now, we could treat him as a suspect.

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:38.760
The blood DNA results on the shirt

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:42.400
and other evidence already prove

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.160
that the witness is innocent.

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:49.840
But he’s still the one with
the highest chance of being suspected.

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:52.160
This case is huge, Inspector.

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:54.280
And it seems to be getting bigger by the minute.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.720
We need more time to work on this.

00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:00.080
No one should become a scapegoat just
because the police want an easy way out.

00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:02.080
Singha.

00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:06.000
Yes, Commander.

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:10.320
I’d like permission to pull more data
on Thamwat Santasakol.

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:13.160
I still believe he’s worth looking into.

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:15.160
He might be the key to closing this case.

00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:13.640
Each victim must have
something connecting them.

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:14.920
We just need to find what that is.

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:17.160
This kind of doll is called a “Tukta Siakaban.”

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:19.680
You’d only find it in a shaman’s house

00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:21.440
or a spiritual medium’s shrine.

00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:23.920
- Help!
- Then can you explain

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.960
why this victim

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.520
buried the doll in their garden?

00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:30.280
I think they were cursed.

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:32.400
Hey, spirit! Come out!

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.160
Someone’s testing your power!

00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:36.080
What’s happening to you now?

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:38.680
It’s a woman... white eyes,

00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:40.520
and her mouth’s slit to her ears.

00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:42.720
Don’t say anything.

00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.000
That’s it.
(Not holding a grudge, right?)

00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:46.880
That’s it, that’s it.

00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:48.000
(Not catching a break at all.)
The moment it hit, for real,

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:49.080
Calm down, man.

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:52.800
(Got reassigned to the captain instead.)

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.920
I just want to wrap up
this case as fast as I can.

00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:56.840
Just a sec.

00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:58.600
- Don’t laugh.
- I’m not.

00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:00.560
Come on.
(Can’t stop laughing.)

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:02.080
Fix the frame real quick.

00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:04.280
(Director, I’m getting sleepy.)

00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:11.640
(Falling for the puppy charm already, huh?)
