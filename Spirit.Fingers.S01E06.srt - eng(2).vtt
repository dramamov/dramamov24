00:11:00.933 --> 00:11:02.467
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:11:02.467 --> 00:11:03.500
Hey, there.

00:11:04.967 --> 00:11:06.033
You're matching like a couple.

00:11:08.033 --> 00:11:09.433
You should pose like a couple today.

00:11:09.433 --> 00:11:10.433
That'd be so adorable.

00:11:10.433 --> 00:11:12.433
- Stop saying that!
- Couple, my foot!

00:11:12.433 --> 00:11:16.233
Wait, where's Gi Jeong?

00:11:17.233 --> 00:11:18.933
I doubt he'll show up today.

00:11:18.933 --> 00:11:22.267
He's cooped up again like a larva for some reason.

00:11:24.567 --> 00:11:25.833
What's this?

00:11:28.167 --> 00:11:30.000
Isn't this a video of Red?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Huh?

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.133
- What's this?
- Wait, that's definitely Red.

00:11:37.167 --> 00:11:38.767
It is him.

00:11:38.767 --> 00:11:40.600
[Live, Subway Line 2, Harley Quinn]

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.267
What on earth is wrong with him?

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.067
That crazy...

00:11:54.333 --> 00:11:55.667
You're a total lunatic!

00:11:55.667 --> 00:11:57.433
Did you really take the subway like that?

00:11:58.133 --> 00:11:59.200
Yes.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.200
That's our Red. So brave!

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.600
Wow, I'm so envious.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.064
If I had half that courage...

00:12:04.064 --> 00:12:05.367
No.

00:12:08.867 --> 00:12:09.967
Hi.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.100
Wow, he looks so cool.

00:12:20.633 --> 00:12:22.000
What on earth are you supposed to be?

00:12:25.433 --> 00:12:27.967
Harley Quinn. The icon of vengeance.

00:12:28.733 --> 00:12:30.400
Hey, today, we're supposed to
dress up as animals...

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.900
Hush!

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.733
You didn't let me finish.

00:12:36.367 --> 00:12:40.500
I'm portraying a bird
caught in Harley Quinn's trap.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.733
Trap?

00:12:41.733 --> 00:12:43.167
What trap?

00:12:43.167 --> 00:12:44.267
There's one

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.300
that's set up

00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:50.100
by the cold and heartless Blue Witch.

00:12:52.233 --> 00:12:54.633
What's this punk babbling about?
That's nothing like a bird...

00:12:56.128 --> 00:12:57.310
Oh my.

00:12:58.767 --> 00:12:59.767
A crow?

00:12:59.767 --> 00:13:01.667
You look like a real bird.

00:13:01.667 --> 00:13:02.800
You prepared thoroughly.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.056
You look just like one. Really.

00:13:07.767 --> 00:13:09.567
What about you, Baeblu?

00:13:09.567 --> 00:13:10.567
Sorry?

00:13:11.667 --> 00:13:14.233
Well, I...

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:17.933
Roar!

00:13:19.167 --> 00:13:21.067
- So cute!
- Adorable!

00:13:22.733 --> 00:13:24.800
- So cute.
- You look so adorable.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.000
What's that? Are you supposed to be Bigfoot?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
- Yes.
- Oh, I see.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.633
- You look just like Bigfoot. What a great idea.
- Isn't she so cute?

00:13:37.433 --> 00:13:39.400
You look super cute. It suits you.

00:13:40.033 --> 00:13:41.833
Did you perm this?

00:13:41.833 --> 00:13:43.200
- Cute.
- They're stuck together.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.567
Shall we begin?

00:13:44.567 --> 00:13:45.933
- Sure.
- Okay.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.100
Cutie Baeblu, would you like to go first?

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.200
Sure.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.200
No, I'll go first.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.867
It's called, 'A Wounded Bird.'

00:13:58.867 --> 00:14:01.000
Seriously, what's with this wounded bird crap?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.533
You're just a lunatic, full of crap.

00:14:02.533 --> 00:14:03.733
Get out of my way.

00:14:04.967 --> 00:14:07.000
Do it right or die.

00:14:07.867 --> 00:14:09.300
U Yeon, you can go later.

00:14:12.533 --> 00:14:14.300
Okay, one minute starts now.

00:14:17.167 --> 00:14:18.700
Time's up. Next.

00:14:26.433 --> 00:14:28.467
Time's up. Next.

00:14:36.633 --> 00:14:38.167
Time's up. Next!

00:14:38.167 --> 00:14:39.433
Next person, go.

00:14:39.433 --> 00:14:41.433
Next. Next person!

00:14:41.433 --> 00:14:42.433
Stop!

00:14:44.633 --> 00:14:46.567
Enough! How many more poses are you doing?

00:14:46.567 --> 00:14:48.133
What's the problem? I haven't even done 100 yet!

00:14:48.133 --> 00:14:49.300
Let go, seriously!

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.867
Other people need a turn too!

00:14:56.233 --> 00:14:57.800
What are you looking at, ugly?

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.833
You punk! Have you lost your mind?

00:15:02.833 --> 00:15:04.200
Why did you hit me?

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.467
U Yeon, I'll avenge you!

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.533
Don't mess with me.

00:15:09.533 --> 00:15:10.833
I'll do the next pose.

00:15:18.867 --> 00:15:20.067
One minute starts now.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.333
Oh, you're using charcoal?

00:15:34.533 --> 00:15:37.433
Yes, I thought it'd be fun.

00:15:37.433 --> 00:15:41.600
Charcoal art needs smudging all over the face.

00:15:43.333 --> 00:15:44.467
Is that right?

00:15:48.167 --> 00:15:49.667
Like this?

00:15:49.667 --> 00:15:51.300
Yes, that's right.

00:15:58.167 --> 00:16:00.633
Hey, that's a great pose!

00:16:00.633 --> 00:16:02.167
Don't mock me.

00:16:02.167 --> 00:16:04.767
Everyone, what are you
waiting for? Let's stand up!

00:16:04.767 --> 00:16:06.467
Come on, rabbit! Dinosaur!

00:16:06.467 --> 00:16:08.400
Except you, Seon Ho! Let's go, animals!

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.633
Follow me!

00:16:09.633 --> 00:16:11.433
Come on.

00:16:11.433 --> 00:16:14.100
Let's go. Follow me!

00:16:18.367 --> 00:16:21.500
Wow, fresh air.

00:16:22.733 --> 00:16:26.133
Everyone, watch your step and follow me closely.

00:16:26.133 --> 00:16:29.033
Both of you, watch your heels so you don't fall.

00:16:29.833 --> 00:16:30.867
Wait up!

00:16:36.167 --> 00:16:38.067
That's the prettiest rabbit I've ever seen.

00:16:38.067 --> 00:16:39.133
Everyone, applaud!

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.367
Wow, Dong Geon.

00:16:51.367 --> 00:16:53.400
You should shoot a carrot commercial.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.600
You worked hard today,
so I give you some special hearts!

00:17:01.433 --> 00:17:02.700
Dinosaur in the forest!

00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:07.633
That was three minutes.
Baeblu, do you want to go next?

00:17:07.633 --> 00:17:08.667
Sure.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.067
What's a puppy doing here?

00:17:17.867 --> 00:17:19.200
Hey, where are you going?

00:17:20.567 --> 00:17:21.800
To take a dump.

00:17:30.567 --> 00:17:33.300
Why's he acting like that today?

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.467
Your overreacting doesn't
even seem bad these days.

00:17:35.467 --> 00:17:38.067
He's just taking it out on Baeblu today.

00:17:38.067 --> 00:17:39.800
Raging hormones, perhaps?

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.367
He's especially unpredictable today, right?

00:17:42.367 --> 00:17:43.933
Did something happen between you two?

00:17:43.933 --> 00:17:45.333
No way.

00:17:45.333 --> 00:17:46.367
Sorry, Baeblu.

00:17:46.367 --> 00:17:49.767
It's my fault for having such a pathetic brother.

00:17:49.767 --> 00:17:50.767
No worries.

00:17:50.767 --> 00:17:52.600
But you siblings are the most entertaining.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.867
Don't suddenly start getting along, okay?

00:17:54.867 --> 00:17:57.367
I'll quit coming here then and there.

00:17:57.367 --> 00:17:58.467
- Geez.
- Geez.

00:17:58.467 --> 00:17:59.933
That won't ever happen.

00:17:59.933 --> 00:18:01.033
What a relief.

00:18:16.233 --> 00:18:17.633
Bigfoot.

00:18:17.633 --> 00:18:21.200
I followed the plan. Why isn't it exciting at all?

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.833
I'll go get Bigfoot.

00:18:30.833 --> 00:18:32.200
Hey, Gi Jeong.

00:18:34.733 --> 00:18:36.833
Hey, listen.

00:18:36.833 --> 00:18:38.400
About the other night...

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.200
Baeblu! Is Bigfoot here?

00:18:41.433 --> 00:18:43.733
Oh, yes. He's right here.

00:18:50.667 --> 00:18:52.367
Bigfoot, where are you going?

00:18:56.467 --> 00:19:00.300
Today's special guest Bigfoot
has declined our invitation.

00:19:01.367 --> 00:19:02.967
Let's wrap up today's croquis session.

00:19:02.967 --> 00:19:04.067
Jeez, it's so hot.

00:19:04.067 --> 00:19:05.900
Let's go get a big bowl of ice cream.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.000
- All right.
- Sounds good.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.333
Then, Red. Can you go get some?

00:19:10.333 --> 00:19:12.200
Baeblu, please go with him.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.167
- Sorry?
- No way.

00:19:14.167 --> 00:19:15.200
I'll go then.

00:19:17.567 --> 00:19:20.300
Go with Baeblu now

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.467
while I'm asking nicely.

00:19:29.472 --> 00:19:30.848
Geez.

00:19:33.733 --> 00:19:35.872
Then I'll pay.

00:19:36.867 --> 00:19:38.533
Pick something tasty, okay?

00:19:39.267 --> 00:19:41.367
We'll be back soon.

00:19:41.367 --> 00:19:42.433
I want the Skeleton Bar.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.900
Hey, Khaki. Yes, that one.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.600
- It's too hot.
- I cast my vote that they make up.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.467
It's clearly a lovers' quarrel.

00:19:54.367 --> 00:19:58.467
I sincerely apologize for my pathetic brother.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.467
But his Harley Quinn dress-up was spot-on.

00:20:02.933 --> 00:20:04.000
What are they doing?

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.200
Go on, do it.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.300
Roar!

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.333
Khaki Dragon!

00:20:07.333 --> 00:20:09.067
Roar!

00:20:09.067 --> 00:20:10.867
Make it more realistic!

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.133
Roar!

00:20:13.133 --> 00:20:14.867
That's enough, Seon Ho.

00:20:14.867 --> 00:20:17.600
You can count on them to embarrass us anywhere.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.300
Khaki Dragon, roar!

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:35.700
Oh?

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.500
This is terrible. Do they really not have it?

00:20:42.133 --> 00:20:43.167
What are you looking for?

00:20:43.167 --> 00:20:45.467
They don't have the ice cream Black mentioned.

00:20:47.667 --> 00:20:48.700
Step aside.

00:21:01.033 --> 00:21:02.267
[Skeleton Bar]
Found it!

00:21:02.267 --> 00:21:03.867
Wow! Where was it?

00:21:03.867 --> 00:21:05.467
I found the last one hiding on the bottom.

00:21:05.467 --> 00:21:07.033
How come I couldn't find it?

00:21:15.733 --> 00:21:18.800
You have to believe it's there to find it.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.500
If you don't believe it's there,
you won't be able to find it.

00:21:22.833 --> 00:21:25.100
But I believed it was there when I was searching.

00:21:26.667 --> 00:21:29.900
No, you were distracted.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.967
That's like searching
without believing it's there.

00:21:32.967 --> 00:21:34.400
I see.

00:21:38.433 --> 00:21:40.200
I'll go pay.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.200
Stay here.

00:21:42.433 --> 00:21:43.867
I'll handle the payment.

00:22:05.933 --> 00:22:07.400
That's the guy from the crosswalk, right?

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.433
Yes, it is.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.067
He still looks gorgeous at second glance.

00:22:11.067 --> 00:22:12.067
Check out those shoulders.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.767
Was that his girlfriend then?

00:22:14.767 --> 00:22:16.000
No way.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.133
She was so ugly.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.367
It must be his sister then.

00:22:19.367 --> 00:22:20.867
That's even less likely.

00:22:20.867 --> 00:22:23.300
Perhaps a stalker?

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.633
Hey, she's right there.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.733
It's fine.

00:22:26.733 --> 00:22:28.167
So what if she hears us?

00:22:30.967 --> 00:22:32.000
Excuse me!

00:22:33.733 --> 00:22:35.000
I'm not a stalker, okay?

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.100
The real stalker is actually him over there.

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.667
He's been obsessing over me one-sidedly.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.200
Your payment is processed.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.333
We weren't talking to you.

00:22:44.333 --> 00:22:47.267
- Why are you picking a fight? You don't know me.
- Stop it.

00:22:47.267 --> 00:22:49.333
You don't know me, either.

00:22:49.333 --> 00:22:50.633
So why are you judging me?

00:22:50.633 --> 00:22:52.067
How old are you?

00:22:52.067 --> 00:22:53.433
Hey, cut it out.

00:22:53.433 --> 00:22:55.067
She keeps talking back to me.

00:22:55.067 --> 00:22:56.600
What's wrong with you people?

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.767
How dare you touch my girl?

00:22:58.767 --> 00:23:00.933
Hey, do you like me or not?

00:23:01.733 --> 00:23:04.100
I like you! I totally like you so much!

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.533
Are you the stalker, or am I?

00:23:05.533 --> 00:23:08.167
I'm the stalker. I'm a total stalker.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.933
- Did you hear that?
- What's wrong with these lunatics?

00:23:13.067 --> 00:23:14.267
I'm sorry.

00:23:14.267 --> 00:23:15.400
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.933
You little punks!

00:23:16.933 --> 00:23:18.567
'My girl?' How pathetic!

00:23:18.567 --> 00:23:19.933
Gosh, seriously!

00:23:19.933 --> 00:23:21.900
How dare you call us punks!

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.300
This is exactly why we can't be together.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.933
- What?
- I didn't do anything wrong!

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.800
But because of you,
people call me ugly and a stalker.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.533
Your existence alone makes me
feel inferior and lowers my self-esteem!

00:23:34.533 --> 00:23:37.533
So stop liking me.

00:23:37.533 --> 00:23:39.648
I won't like you, either.

00:23:39.648 --> 00:23:40.736
N-No...

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.700
And I'm not ugly, you fool!

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:58.533
♫ I run toward you ♫

00:23:58.533 --> 00:24:01.600
♫ Until I'm breathless ♫

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.533
♫ Even if I forget everything, it doesn't matter ♫

00:24:04.533 --> 00:24:05.933
She's so cool.

00:24:17.467 --> 00:24:19.933
How about a team dinner today?

00:24:19.933 --> 00:24:21.033
That sounds good.

00:24:21.767 --> 00:24:24.500
Geu Rin and I have to do something today.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.533
What's up with you two? A date?

00:24:26.533 --> 00:24:27.667
No, it's a school project.

00:24:27.667 --> 00:24:30.567
I think I should head out early today too.

00:24:30.567 --> 00:24:33.267
Hey, but exams are over. Why?

00:24:33.267 --> 00:24:35.467
Then let's just go home today.

00:24:35.467 --> 00:24:37.533
Okay, see you next time then.

00:24:37.533 --> 00:24:39.333
- I'm heading out.
- See you later.

00:24:39.333 --> 00:24:40.967
- I'll go first.
- Okay, see you later.

00:24:40.967 --> 00:24:44.000
- Have fun on your date.
- It's not a date. We're doing homework.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.167
Come here. You haven't been beaten enough.

00:24:45.167 --> 00:24:46.467
Why did you act like that toward U Yeon today?

00:24:46.467 --> 00:24:48.167
- That hurts, Green Pig!
- Hey, stop it.

00:24:48.167 --> 00:24:49.533
You little!

00:24:49.533 --> 00:24:52.000
- Seon Ho!
- Seon Ho.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.533
Green Pig, you're in big trouble now.

00:24:54.533 --> 00:24:57.600
Hey, you made Seon Ho's nose bleed.
You need to take care of him now.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.667
Seon Ho.

00:25:02.667 --> 00:25:03.700
It's okay.

00:25:05.133 --> 00:25:06.700
My nose stopped bleeding.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.867
I'm sorry, Seon Ho.

00:25:09.867 --> 00:25:11.667
Just hit me instead, okay?

00:25:11.667 --> 00:25:13.133
I said it's okay.

00:25:13.133 --> 00:25:15.000
I'll take full responsibility, okay?

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.300
If your nose is broken, I'll pay for your surgery.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.833
Will you really take responsibility for me?

00:25:23.733 --> 00:25:25.067
What?

00:25:25.067 --> 00:25:26.967
Then take responsibility for my grades first.

00:25:28.233 --> 00:25:29.867
Where were we supposed to go first?

00:25:37.567 --> 00:25:39.700
- Hey!
- It worked!

00:25:42.833 --> 00:25:44.500
Did it open? Did we escape?

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:45.500
There's more.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.700
What? We weren't done?

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.833
♫ You're shining brightly, like a star ♫

00:25:53.833 --> 00:25:55.033
Hey, let's try that.

00:25:56.567 --> 00:25:57.600
Give me some money.

00:25:59.333 --> 00:26:00.667
Oh, what's happening?

00:26:00.667 --> 00:26:04.600
♫ With your own light, your own color ♫

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.133
♫ You make the whole world beautiful ♫

00:26:08.133 --> 00:26:12.833
♫ You, who fill my dreams ♫

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.267
♫ I really want to reach you ♫

00:26:18.067 --> 00:26:20.333
This is the right way. Put this on the right side.

00:26:20.333 --> 00:26:21.667
That's not how you do it!

00:26:21.667 --> 00:26:22.800
Back off if you're just going to nag.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.900
I'm telling you, that's not how you do it.

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.867
This is how you do it.

00:26:25.867 --> 00:26:27.424
- You're going to regret it.
- Oh.

00:26:27.424 --> 00:26:28.433
Oh, right.

00:26:28.433 --> 00:26:29.867
Let's take a proof photo.

00:26:30.567 --> 00:26:31.567
Ready?

00:26:33.233 --> 00:26:35.333
One, two, three.

00:26:37.733 --> 00:26:39.700
I was actually worried.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.900
That working on this project today
might make us awkward again.

00:26:44.867 --> 00:26:47.267
I wonder what you'll write in the report.

00:26:47.267 --> 00:26:49.933
I'm going to write honestly.
Exactly how I felt today.

00:26:49.933 --> 00:26:51.933
'Koo Seon Ho, my date for the day,

00:26:51.933 --> 00:26:55.933
is kind and fun to be with,
and makes people feel comfortable.

00:26:55.933 --> 00:26:59.033
And he keeps his promises.'

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.367
When you said you'd go back to being
my guy friend, I didn't believe you.

00:27:03.367 --> 00:27:04.733
I thought it'd feel awkward forever.

00:27:08.133 --> 00:27:09.700
- Geu Rin.
- Yes?

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.133
What?

00:27:20.333 --> 00:27:21.633
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:27:22.433 --> 00:27:23.533
Are you going to say something weird again?

00:27:23.533 --> 00:27:24.700
- Geu Rin.
- Hold on.

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.100
Every time you say my name like that,
I get super anxious

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:28.500
that you might blurt out something again.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.600
I said, you're kind and fun to be with,
and make people feel comfortable.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.833
But don't overthink it
because it's nothing special.

00:27:32.833 --> 00:27:36.167
I know I rushed you.

00:27:37.333 --> 00:27:38.967
I also know I shouldn't pressure you.

00:27:38.967 --> 00:27:42.333
Then why did you? That was out of character.
Do you know how much I...

00:27:42.333 --> 00:27:43.433
I'm enlisting.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:50.833
What did you say?

00:27:50.833 --> 00:27:52.433
I'm leaving after this semester.

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.867
So I felt rushed.

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:08.733
Geu Rin.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.133
This place just opened recently.
I heard it's really good.

00:28:27.133 --> 00:28:28.133
Oh, really?

00:28:28.133 --> 00:28:29.467
What kind of food do you like?

00:28:29.467 --> 00:28:31.300
I like everything you like.

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.933
Your reservation is confirmed.
Please follow the host.

00:28:35.033 --> 00:28:36.500
Welcome. Do you have a reservation?

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.833
- Yes.
- Your name, please?

00:28:37.833 --> 00:28:39.967
- Kim Na Yeong.
- Ms. Kim Na Yeong.

00:28:49.333 --> 00:28:51.584
- Tae Seon, over here.
- Okay.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.600
Excuse me.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:06.033
Why are you so late?
I thought I was going to starve to death.

00:29:12.467 --> 00:29:14.144
Mom, you like Aglio e Olio, right?

00:29:16.233 --> 00:29:17.700
Mom, you became even prettier.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.533
- Se Ra!
- Mom...

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:24.833
Oh, I know you like it.

00:29:25.767 --> 00:29:27.167
Your favorite.

00:29:29.333 --> 00:29:30.767
Yummy.

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:35.900
Ju Ni kept saying she misses you,
so I brought her along.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:37.700
Are you happy now?

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.833
- Yes, Mommy.
- Yes, you are.

00:29:39.833 --> 00:29:40.833
Isn't your sister so pretty?

00:29:41.667 --> 00:29:42.667
Isn't she?

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.600
Should we order steak too?

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:51.767
Whatever you want.

00:29:54.333 --> 00:29:55.633
What do you think of the ambience here?

00:29:58.867 --> 00:30:00.067
Seems nice.

00:30:01.367 --> 00:30:02.667
I'm sorry, Se Ra.

00:30:02.667 --> 00:30:06.567
She is very weak,
so her stomach gets upset very easily.

00:30:06.567 --> 00:30:08.433
Get going now. She seems to be in pain.

00:30:08.433 --> 00:30:10.400
I'm sorry, Se Ra.

00:30:12.033 --> 00:30:13.533
I'll call you.

00:30:13.533 --> 00:30:14.767
Let's meet up again.

00:30:14.767 --> 00:30:16.833
We can go eat something even better. All right?

00:30:16.833 --> 00:30:17.833
Get home safely.

00:30:17.833 --> 00:30:19.400
I'm sorry.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.433
Say bye.

00:30:38.867 --> 00:30:40.033
Tae Seon.

00:30:40.033 --> 00:30:42.367
What? Are you daydreaming again?

00:30:42.367 --> 00:30:44.100
What's wrong with you today? This isn't very fun.

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.133
You're right.

00:30:48.767 --> 00:30:50.533
This isn't fun for some reason.

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:54.100
Hey, where'd you go?

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.833
If you were leaving, you should've told me.

00:30:56.833 --> 00:30:59.700
Are you messing around
just because you're good-looking?

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.600
Do you think I'm a pushover
because I paid for things?

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:02.733
Do you think I'm your friend?

00:31:02.733 --> 00:31:05.567
Oh, I'm sorry. Something urgent came up.

00:31:05.567 --> 00:31:06.867
Hey!

00:31:06.867 --> 00:31:09.100
What's with these awful manners?

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.733
It's over between us!

00:31:12.733 --> 00:31:13.733
I got dumped.

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:24.000
Pretending to be fine
and acting like nothing's wrong.

00:31:24.933 --> 00:31:26.567
Keeping a poker face is easier.

00:31:31.933 --> 00:31:34.267
But it's better not get too used to it.

00:31:37.133 --> 00:31:39.500
You'll end up forgetting what you're truly like.

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:43.500
They were selling this over there.

00:31:44.133 --> 00:31:45.600
I need to catch my bus on the other side.

00:31:47.433 --> 00:31:48.467
Bye.

00:31:51.067 --> 00:31:53.567
You'll get punished if you waste food.

00:31:53.567 --> 00:31:54.600
So eat it.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.700
Did I do the right thing?

00:32:33.533 --> 00:32:36.000
Sorry I'm so handsome.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.900
You're not ugly.

00:32:40.533 --> 00:32:42.400
I was just saying that earlier.

00:32:44.367 --> 00:32:45.567
You're pretty.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.467
You're the prettiest in the whole world.

00:33:09.833 --> 00:33:13.333
Green Pig is drinking alcohol under the moonlight.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.400
Something wrong?

00:33:39.533 --> 00:33:40.567
Hey!

00:33:42.767 --> 00:33:43.800
Darn it.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.000
What's going on?

00:34:04.367 --> 00:34:08.100
Fine. I wasn't really expecting an answer anyway.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:12.767
But please, answer my question.

00:34:15.767 --> 00:34:17.667
You're bothering me. Get lost.

00:34:17.667 --> 00:34:20.767
Why was I born so unnecessarily handsome?

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:26.667
Green Pig, we came from the same womb.

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:29.933
Perhaps, we had different parents?

00:34:35.267 --> 00:34:36.300
You.

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:39.933
What?

00:34:41.233 --> 00:34:42.867
How long until you enlist?

00:34:42.867 --> 00:34:45.833
Gosh, is that your new way to curse?

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:50.533
That's creative indeed, but why would you...

00:34:50.533 --> 00:34:52.753
Someone like you should be enlisting.

00:34:53.472 --> 00:34:55.200
Someone like you.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.033
Oh.

00:35:04.933 --> 00:35:07.400
Wow, Baeblu's improved so much.

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.167
The birth of a monster rookie.

00:35:09.167 --> 00:35:11.467
It's not that good.

00:35:11.467 --> 00:35:13.300
Should we take a short break then?

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:14.967
Those who haven't seen the drawings yet,
please take a look.

00:35:14.967 --> 00:35:16.933
Let's take a ten-minute break,
and then do a five-minute croquis session.

00:35:16.933 --> 00:35:18.900
- Understood.
- Okay.

00:35:23.033 --> 00:35:24.633
Nam Gi Jeong's croquis book?

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.800
What? He didn't draw me at all.

00:35:37.033 --> 00:35:39.600
Hey, I saw your drawing.

00:35:43.167 --> 00:35:45.867
- Are you crazy?
- I said I saw your drawing!

00:35:45.867 --> 00:35:48.400
You drew Brown Finger quite well.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.400
Of course, I would.

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.667
But how come you didn't draw me?

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.800
Hey!

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.000
Answer me. Stop pretending to sleep!

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.400
Stop bothering me, seriously!

00:35:58.133 --> 00:36:00.133
I didn't want to draw you
because you're painfully ugly. So what?

00:36:06.933 --> 00:36:07.967
Hey!

00:36:09.367 --> 00:36:11.367
I'm terribly sorry for being so ugly.

00:36:14.633 --> 00:36:17.400
What's with that absurd dream?

00:36:26.567 --> 00:36:28.267
But it's not his fault.

00:36:28.267 --> 00:36:30.733
If he were at fault,

00:36:30.733 --> 00:36:32.833
it's just that he's overly handsome.

00:36:33.633 --> 00:36:35.367
I know that too.

00:36:47.967 --> 00:36:50.272
But why are you hiding?

00:36:52.233 --> 00:36:53.267
I don't know.

00:36:55.167 --> 00:36:58.816
I feel like there's some
distance between us lately.

00:37:00.033 --> 00:37:01.033
What?

00:37:05.333 --> 00:37:06.400
Delulu.

00:37:08.133 --> 00:37:09.200
Delulu!

00:37:15.967 --> 00:37:18.000
[I'm ugly, right? Like really ugly, right?]

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.333
Hey, he's trying so hard.

00:37:20.233 --> 00:37:23.200
Your boyfriend's ready to do anything for you.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.033
Hey, what boyfriend? It's not like that.

00:37:26.033 --> 00:37:27.933
Of course, it's not.

00:37:27.933 --> 00:37:29.933
Wow, how could he be so handsome?

00:37:29.933 --> 00:37:32.167
- Is he?
- Yes, totally.

00:37:32.167 --> 00:37:33.500
Even more so than Legend?

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:35.000
Hey, don't you dare compare them!

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.267
- But you said he's handsome.
- Gosh, Se Ra. Stop it.

00:37:37.267 --> 00:37:38.333
There you go again.

00:37:44.467 --> 00:37:46.467
Stop sending pictures!

00:37:46.467 --> 00:37:47.567
Hey.

00:37:47.567 --> 00:37:49.367
Which one of these is the ugliest?

00:37:49.367 --> 00:37:50.933
What now?

00:37:50.933 --> 00:37:54.267
This, this, and this.

00:37:54.267 --> 00:37:55.300
Should I punch you?

00:37:57.967 --> 00:38:00.767
Or do you know how to make
yourself uglier? You must know.

00:38:01.467 --> 00:38:02.967
I should just punch you. Seriously.

00:38:03.867 --> 00:38:05.800
How is it that you don't know?

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.100
Hey, Byeon Soon, do you know?

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:08.467
Hey, don't disrespect Byeon Soon.

00:38:08.467 --> 00:38:10.200
He's quite popular with older girls too.

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.433
Oh right, how did your date go
with Na Yeong yesterday?

00:38:12.433 --> 00:38:14.267
- It's none of your business.
- You got dumped again?

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:17.633
You don't know how to keep
your relationships last.

00:38:17.633 --> 00:38:18.933
Guys.

00:38:18.933 --> 00:38:21.500
Now I'm completely ignored.
She won't even look at my messages.

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.867
If you have something to say,
say it now. Stop interrupting.

00:38:31.367 --> 00:38:33.000
I've got you a gift.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000
A gift?

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.233
No thanks, I don't need it.

00:38:41.233 --> 00:38:45.533
I told my grandma it's for a friend
and she picked them out for me.

00:38:51.133 --> 00:38:52.467
Aren't they pretty?

00:38:52.467 --> 00:38:53.667
- Try them on.
- No thanks.

00:38:54.333 --> 00:38:55.433
Let me help you put them on.

00:38:55.433 --> 00:38:56.833
I said no!

00:38:56.833 --> 00:38:58.900
Make sure you wear them tomorrow, okay?

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:00.067
Gosh, I said no!

00:39:00.067 --> 00:39:01.167
Look at them goofing off.

00:39:01.167 --> 00:39:02.333
Bong Gu, the idiot.

00:39:02.333 --> 00:39:04.267
Why does he keep being nice to him?

00:39:04.267 --> 00:39:06.233
My mom said,

00:39:06.233 --> 00:39:09.467
Song U Dol's mom is really awful too.

00:39:09.467 --> 00:39:10.767
Right. I heard that too.

00:39:11.733 --> 00:39:14.600
Oh my, U Dol's mom.

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:17.067
You have an amazing figure.

00:39:18.067 --> 00:39:21.033
Oh, please. Everyone does nowadays.

00:39:21.033 --> 00:39:25.400
I really hate being told that
I don't take good care of myself.

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:29.100
If I can't care for my own body,
how can I care for the kids?

00:39:30.767 --> 00:39:32.500
- You're right.
- That's true.

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:35.133
U Dol's mom and we are fundamentally different.

00:39:35.133 --> 00:39:38.667
You were a very famous ballerina
in your prime, right?

00:39:38.667 --> 00:39:39.667
Which performances did you do?

00:39:39.667 --> 00:39:42.267
Swan Lake? Giselle?

00:39:42.267 --> 00:39:43.633
I did many.

00:39:44.433 --> 00:39:45.900
What's the use of being successful in the past?

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.533
Now I'm just a housewife
with only two sons to my name.

00:39:48.533 --> 00:39:53.667
Come on! One son goes to Seoul National University
and the other is a prodigy. Don't be modest!

00:39:53.667 --> 00:39:57.767
I'm a housewife who doesn't even have
sons like that to show for. I feel bad.

00:39:57.767 --> 00:40:00.767
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

00:40:03.667 --> 00:40:06.067
Great! Nice!

00:40:06.067 --> 00:40:09.633
Give it a cooler vibe. Yes, cool vibes.

00:40:09.633 --> 00:40:11.033
Okay, focus here.

00:40:11.033 --> 00:40:13.200
Think of seagulls. Squawk, squawk!

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.267
Yes, hold still.

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:16.800
What's wrong with him today? Has he lost his mind?

00:40:19.333 --> 00:40:21.833
So stop liking me.

00:40:21.833 --> 00:40:23.433
I won't like you, either.

00:40:26.933 --> 00:40:28.733
We're done here, right? I'm leaving.

00:40:28.733 --> 00:40:29.767
No, you can't.

00:40:29.767 --> 00:40:32.867
Hey, it was going quite well.
Why are you stopping without my permission?

00:40:32.867 --> 00:40:34.567
[Miss Piggy]
Put down your phone and go stand there!

00:40:34.567 --> 00:40:36.467
Hey! I'm your boss.

00:40:36.467 --> 00:40:37.700
Can't you hear me?

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:42.200
[Miss Piggy]

00:40:45.533 --> 00:40:46.600
What's wrong with him?

00:40:50.733 --> 00:40:51.867
No.

00:40:51.867 --> 00:40:54.667
That's not what I meant to do. No!

00:40:54.667 --> 00:40:56.200
I didn't mean to reject the call!

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.567
- That lunatic.
- That lunatic.

00:41:00.567 --> 00:41:02.067
Why is he so out of it?

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.267
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

00:41:12.267 --> 00:41:13.933
I didn't mean to reject your call.

00:41:13.933 --> 00:41:17.433
I just got nervous, I mean, startled
when the phone rang suddenly.

00:41:19.067 --> 00:41:21.767
Anyway, why did you call?

00:41:21.767 --> 00:41:23.867
Oh, well...

00:41:23.867 --> 00:41:24.900
You know what?

00:41:26.967 --> 00:41:28.167
I have good news.

00:41:28.967 --> 00:41:30.833
I look really ugly today.

00:41:30.833 --> 00:41:31.867
Do you want to meet up?

00:41:35.633 --> 00:41:36.667
U Yeon!

00:41:45.133 --> 00:41:47.833
What? Don't come this way!

00:41:50.367 --> 00:41:52.967
Aren't I right? I look ugly, right?

00:41:52.967 --> 00:41:53.967
What?

00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:59.233
But I thought I looked ugly.

00:42:02.533 --> 00:42:03.633
I'm sorry.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.767
About what?

00:42:06.767 --> 00:42:10.467
I took it out on you yesterday.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.433
It's not even your fault, you know?

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:19.167
Don't sweat it.

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:22.933
Remember what I told you before?

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:27.136
Some days I feel worthless like a 10-won coin.

00:42:28.133 --> 00:42:29.933
Yesterday was one of those days.

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:33.367
It's because of my messed-up thinking,

00:42:34.067 --> 00:42:35.500
but I took it out on you.

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:39.167
I'm sorry.

00:42:51.933 --> 00:42:52.967
So then,

00:42:53.833 --> 00:42:55.600
I can keep liking you, right?

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.533
- What?
- You told me to stop liking you out of anger.

00:42:59.533 --> 00:43:02.600
Why are you talking about that again?

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:03.900
That's not what's important now.

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:05.300
It's important to me.

00:43:06.133 --> 00:43:08.933
If I keep liking you when you don't
want me to, that'd make me a stalker.

00:43:08.933 --> 00:43:10.600
They even came up with anti-stalking laws.

00:43:11.367 --> 00:43:13.567
I can keep liking you then, right?

00:43:13.567 --> 00:43:14.833
I don't know. Do whatever.

00:43:15.467 --> 00:43:17.267
Stop asking things like that.

00:43:17.267 --> 00:43:18.300
Yes!

00:43:20.833 --> 00:43:23.867
So you'll start liking me too now?

00:43:23.867 --> 00:43:24.867
What?

00:43:26.067 --> 00:43:30.533
Well, you told me not to like you
because it lowers your self-esteem.

00:43:30.533 --> 00:43:32.067
But you said that was wrong.

00:43:32.067 --> 00:43:34.867
That means, we're back to square one.

00:43:34.867 --> 00:43:36.100
I can keep liking you,

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:39.200
and you can start liking me too, right?

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.200
What's happening?

00:43:40.933 --> 00:43:43.967
Why does this strangely make sense?

00:43:43.967 --> 00:43:45.300
You still don't get it?

00:43:48.567 --> 00:43:49.633
Then,

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.344
should we try kissing?

00:43:53.344 --> 00:43:54.900
There you go again!

00:43:59.767 --> 00:44:00.767
Hey!

00:44:04.767 --> 00:44:05.800
Hey!

00:44:17.267 --> 00:44:18.267
Hey!

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.700
Hey, I fell down!

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:24.267
So... sorry.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.800
You're good at playing hard to get.

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.667
You're such a player, aren't you?

00:44:31.833 --> 00:44:33.633
I'll go get drinks for us.

00:44:34.733 --> 00:44:38.433
Hey, don't bother. I don't need it!

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:06.600
Why did I hug him from the back out of nowhere?

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:08.233
Gosh, it's so embarrassing.

00:45:13.067 --> 00:45:14.233
What is he doing?

00:45:19.967 --> 00:45:21.567
Are you here alone?

00:45:21.567 --> 00:45:22.633
What?

00:45:22.633 --> 00:45:23.767
Did you come to see flowers?

00:45:23.767 --> 00:45:26.633
Yes, of course. I came to see flowers.

00:45:26.633 --> 00:45:28.267
What about you?

00:45:28.267 --> 00:45:31.467
I came with a friend to see flowers too.

00:45:31.467 --> 00:45:33.533
She went to get some drinks.

00:45:33.533 --> 00:45:36.867
My name is Gi Jeong from Class 2-3 of Chiwon High.

00:45:36.867 --> 00:45:39.033
What? Diapers?

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:42.933
It's Gi Jeong. Gi Jeong!

00:45:43.933 --> 00:45:47.367
Granny, this is my gift for you.

00:46:00.767 --> 00:46:01.833
U Yeon.

00:46:25.333 --> 00:46:28.033
You look beautiful, Granny.

00:46:28.033 --> 00:46:30.367
An old lady looking beautiful?

00:46:31.467 --> 00:46:34.933
This reminds me of my childhood.

00:46:34.933 --> 00:46:40.100
I used to make flower crowns when I was young.

00:47:16.767 --> 00:47:17.800
I'm done!

00:47:23.033 --> 00:47:24.033
Hey.

00:47:34.867 --> 00:47:39.000
It seemed like you were feeling nostalgic
about your youthful days. I couldn't help it.

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:46.467
I'm sorry.

00:47:46.467 --> 00:47:47.933
I did a terrible job, right?

00:47:48.967 --> 00:47:50.700
You must've been much prettier.

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:51.900
Not at all.

00:47:53.233 --> 00:47:54.867
It looks just like how I used to look.

00:47:58.133 --> 00:48:00.367
Thank you, dear.

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:06.667
The drawing I made from my imagination

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.733
took Granny down memory lane,

00:48:11.067 --> 00:48:14.560
and we listened to her stories,
as precious as treasures,

00:48:15.633 --> 00:48:19.600
for a very long time.

00:48:22.267 --> 00:48:24.267
Granny, watch out for cars!

00:48:28.967 --> 00:48:30.833
Her voice

00:48:33.033 --> 00:48:34.567
is as warm as spring breeze.

00:48:53.467 --> 00:48:56.100
Hey! It improved!

00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:58.333
It improved!

00:48:59.367 --> 00:49:00.667
Hey, yours improved too.

00:49:00.667 --> 00:49:03.300
Hey, it's nothing compared to Song's.

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:05.667
You'll finally get your mom's permission
for the drawing club?

00:49:05.667 --> 00:49:07.000
I'll ask today.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.500
With this, I think my mom should allow it.

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:11.733
Gosh, you finally get to end
your risky double life.

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.267
Thank you. Thank you!

00:49:16.267 --> 00:49:17.267
- U!
- Mi!

[Report Card]
See?

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:25.333
You can do well too, my goodness.

00:49:25.333 --> 00:49:27.300
Would I have pushed you for nothing?

00:49:28.767 --> 00:49:32.033
All right. Let's add
another tutoring session while at it.

00:49:32.767 --> 00:49:36.267
Let's see. The Sunday class...

00:49:37.567 --> 00:49:39.467
- Mom.
- Yes?

00:49:39.467 --> 00:49:41.667
Since I improved my grades, grant me one wish.

00:49:41.667 --> 00:49:42.800
Fine.

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.433
What do you want?
Shopping at the department store?

00:49:44.433 --> 00:49:45.467
No.

00:49:46.733 --> 00:49:49.000
There's a club I really want to join.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.367
What club?

00:49:50.367 --> 00:49:51.967
Book club? Essay writing?

00:49:51.967 --> 00:49:53.000
No.

00:49:54.833 --> 00:49:56.733
It's a drawing club...

00:49:57.633 --> 00:49:58.633
What?

00:49:59.467 --> 00:50:00.833
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:50:00.833 --> 00:50:02.633
- What club?
- What?

00:50:02.633 --> 00:50:05.333
What do you mean, you want to draw out of nowhere?

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:10.033
Art majors are only for those who
have been training since childhood.

00:50:10.033 --> 00:50:11.733
No, it's not like that.

00:50:11.733 --> 00:50:14.033
It's a croquis club. Skill doesn't matter.

00:50:14.033 --> 00:50:15.500
We just gather to draw
with people who enjoy art...

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:19.133
So why would someone
who can't draw join a drawing club?

00:50:19.133 --> 00:50:21.500
You'll just be fooling around there!

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:23.200
What kind of pathetic club is that?

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:25.433
There's no law that says
only the skilled can join such a club.

00:50:25.433 --> 00:50:28.267
Of course, there is!

00:50:28.267 --> 00:50:29.933
That's how the world works.

00:50:29.933 --> 00:50:32.267
Even if you stick only with what
you're good at, it's still hard to survive!

00:50:32.267 --> 00:50:33.300
Look at your dad.

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:36.133
He works all night
and doesn't even get to come home.

00:50:36.133 --> 00:50:38.167
Stop spouting nonsense, U Yeon.

00:50:38.867 --> 00:50:40.333
While everyone else is studying hard,

00:50:40.333 --> 00:50:43.700
will you waste your time on useless drawings?

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:45.500
Your grades aren't even that good!

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.333
Even if you study to death,
you'd barely be able to keep up.

00:50:48.333 --> 00:50:51.067
How could you be saying all this nonsense?

00:50:52.033 --> 00:50:53.667
Stop talking nonsense and study!

00:50:55.967 --> 00:50:57.600
Don't call it useless!

00:50:58.633 --> 00:50:59.633
What?

00:51:00.367 --> 00:51:03.333
Don't belittle it just because you don't like it.

00:51:03.333 --> 00:51:05.433
Who did I belittle?

00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:09.367
Me.

00:51:09.367 --> 00:51:10.367
What?

00:51:10.367 --> 00:51:12.640
You've been belittling me, Mom!

00:51:13.533 --> 00:51:16.400
You look down on me and compare me
to others every single day!

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:19.667
I'm not someone you can just disrespect.

00:51:19.667 --> 00:51:21.567
I'm not some trash can you can kick around!

00:51:21.567 --> 00:51:22.767
Stop disrespecting me!

00:51:22.767 --> 00:51:23.800
You...

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:26.833
And... And!

Remove that kimchi refrigerator from my room!

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:48.000

U Yeon!

00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:09.233
It's not because I didn't get
permission for the croquis club.

00:52:10.467 --> 00:52:12.567
The fact that my mom was that kind of person

00:52:13.933 --> 00:52:17.067
made me so furious and sad.

Why would I? Don't be silly.

I won't call you gorilla anymore, sis.

So come straight home after school, okay?

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:37.400
Of course.

00:58:49.133 --> 00:58:51.700
Gi Jeong is my ex-boyfriend.

00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:52.733
What?

00:58:56.867 --> 00:59:00.467
You should've seen Poo-Gi Larva, you know?

00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:02.900
Here. Look at this.

00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:05.500
Whenever he does that, it drives me nuts.

00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:08.200
This larva cover was
his middle school entrance gift from my dad.

00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:11.133
Why did my dad get a pink one for a boy?

00:59:11.133 --> 00:59:13.933
But he treats it like a security blanket.

00:59:13.933 --> 00:59:14.933
Hey.

00:59:14.933 --> 00:59:17.500
Do you think he'd kill me
if I burned it behind his back?
