Madam,

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:36.700
according to the information
sent back by Jiuwei,

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.000
Quan Jingting

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.590
has completely
enraged Wangquan Fugui this time.

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:41.720
These past few days,

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.760
he's been searching for Quan Jingting
like a madman.

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:48.640
Everything is going just as I expected.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.160
The seed of hatred has been planted.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.750
Now all we need to do

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:57.280
is wait for it to take root
and sprout in Wangquan Fugui's heart.

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:58.880
Once his heart

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.880
is completely consumed by hatred,

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:03.440
that will be the day I break the circle.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.000
By then,

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.620
his body, corroded by hatred,

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:10.790
will become my perfect vessel.

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:11.830
Go.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:15.250
Tell Jiuwei to keep a close eye
on Wangquan Fugui

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.200
and strike when the time comes.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.310
Yes.

how could you die?

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.800

the Wangquan Sword with my own hands!

Wangquan Fugui,

you've been suppressing
the Myriad Blight Formation alone.

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:08.030
Your strength has long been spent.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.440

and reclaim the Wangquan Sword.

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.270
Then the Wangquan family

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:23.030
will be mine!

Wangquan Fugui,

do you know what the most painful thing

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.400
in the world is?

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.440
It's wanting to save someone

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:28.440
but being unable to.

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:32.830
You couldn't save Wangquan Hongye.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.550
You couldn't save

do you remember this?

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.110
I heard that in the Western Regions,
humans and demons live together,

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:11.350
and the line between them
is still blurred.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:12.480
Even dragon demons appear
from time to time.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.140
It must be quite interesting.

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:15.980
I'll go out in your place first

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:17.580
to see what the world is like.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.170
Here, take this.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.030

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.400

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:28.920
Yeah.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.830
Although it's perfect for stone-skipping,

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:37.880
there are no lakes in the Western Regions.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.140
So I never learned how.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:44.970

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:54.390
come back then.

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:31.480
Wangquan Fugui!

Looks like you're nothing special
after all.

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:39.400
I am the true ruler of the world!

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:41.960
To stand against me

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.070
is to die!
