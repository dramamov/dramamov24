00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.640
Ma'am.

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.200
Is this Lin Fang's home?

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.519
Lin Fang is dead.

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:54.480
I know.

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:55.840
Her family members?

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.159
She only had an older brother.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.439
He is never home.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.760
When did she pass away?

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.319
About four or five years ago.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.719
She did odd jobs out of town.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.520
Her brother visited her once

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:10.199
and said that

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.400
she had died of illness.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.319
He didn't

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:13.719
even bring her corpse back.

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:16.159
Do you know if Lin Fang

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:17.439
was dating someone?

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:18.759
Dating someone?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.120
She was married.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.120
M-Married?

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.800
Just one year before she died,

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.879
she came back here

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.240
and held a wedding banquet.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Her family was

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.960
quite poor.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.240
So was her husband.

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:33.439
That guy couldn't

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.719
even afford

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:37.280
the bride price.
Her brother was furious...

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.879
Take a look.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.439
Is this

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.319
her husband?

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.360
I can't tell.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.599
Go ask her brother.

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:48.759
Do you know

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.080
what her brother does now?

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.879
In your city folks' terms,

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:02.159
I'm a freelancer.

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:04.560
You don't farm?

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.759
For what?

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.719
For some petty income?
I leased out the land.

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:12.520
So you do nothing at all?

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:14.840
I'm planning

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:16.800
my business venture.

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:20.879
You say you're Lin Fang's classmate.

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.159
Why haven't I seen you before?

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.639
I've never met you, sir.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.960
My sister died years ago.

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:30.840
Why are you here now?

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.879
I want to ask you something.

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.159
How did Lin Fang die?

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.280
My sister had a tragic life.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.840
When she was ten,

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:52.960
our parents died.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.599
After middle school,

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:55.919
she went to work.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.719
Then she died in her twenties.

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:00.520
Didn't she get married?

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.520
Yeah.

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:02.960
She married some guy

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.199
who was quite poor.

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.000
No bride price.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.599
I supported her all those years,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.159
but got nothing in return.

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:12.479
She married Zeng Jie, right?

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.879
You know him?

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:17.639
I've heard.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.639
The artist.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.959
Yeah.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.519
He's no country bumpkin

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:23.519
anymore.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.360
Now they call him Master.

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:27.000
He's some big shot now.

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.759
When did Lin Fang

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:31.120
marry Zeng Jie?

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:35.319
It's been four years.

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.680
My sister died in 2015,

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.439
less than a year

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.560
after the wedding.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.759
We country folk hold banquets first.

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.079
They didn't even get
the marriage certificates.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.959
So technically,

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.279
Master Zeng could remarry

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:50.600
without it counting

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.839
as a second marriage.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.879
Are you still

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:54.959
in contact with Zeng Jie?

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.920
He's a professor now.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.639
Why would he talk to me?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.399
But he was your brother-in-law.

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:03.519
How could he cut ties?

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:08.240
How exactly did Lin Fang die?

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:12.839
Aren't you her classmate?

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.839
Don't you know

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:15.519
she had congenital heart disease?

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:17.160
Oh, right...

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:19.480
Sir.

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:21.560
So, was Zeng Jie good to Lin Fang?

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:25.560
How do I put it?

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.040
If he wasn't good,

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:28.720
why would my sister marry him?

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.800
She married him

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:31.000
without the bride price

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.839
and threatened

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:33.480
to cut ties with me when I opposed.

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:35.240
But then again,

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:37.160
I can't recall anything
he's done for her.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.439
My sister always took care of him.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.639
Zeng Jie has a congenital

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:42.560
stomach disorders.

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:44.439
My sister was always making

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.639
different meals for him.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.839
Millet, pumpkin, yam

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:48.160
porridge, pork rib soup...

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.319
But Zeng Jie has always

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.839
been popular with women.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.800
Just a year after my sister passed away,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.079
he found another woman.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.839
She is so pretty.

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:00.920
Sir.

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:02.720
Do you know if Zeng Jie

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:03.920
was seeing someone else?

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.560
A rich lady?

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:11.000
Why are you asking about him?

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:12.439
What's it to you?

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:14.519
Just making conversation.

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:16.839
You said he was popular with women.

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:17.439
I'm jealous.

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:20.240
You're just passing through?

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:21.240
Yeah.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.959
If nothing else, I'll head

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.000
to see my wife.

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:32.720
Your bag.

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:33.519
Here.

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:37.040
Thanks.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.120
Off to see my wife.

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:41.560
Who's your wife?

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.319
Lin Shan!

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.680
Have you no shame?

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:45.120
I've told you so many times.

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:47.279
I might never walk again.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.600
Stop wasting your time.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.079
If you never walk again,

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:53.279
then I'll have to take care of you.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.839
Which one of your relatives

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.639
has come to help you?

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.639
It's just me, isn't it?

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:01.000
Apart from me,

00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:02.519
who cares about you?

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:04.040
I don't need you.

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:08.920
I know you want me gone.

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:11.199
But since you can't move,

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:13.800
I'm sticking around.

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:16.279
Now,

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:18.040
eat your meal.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.800
After that,

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.279
I'll help you with your exercises.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.519
No.

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:27.199
By the way,

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:30.480
I've paid

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:31.600
the hospital fees

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:33.000
for the next six months.

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:35.680
Who told you to pay for me?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.680
Just follow the doctor's orders.

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:38.959
The doctor said

00:07:39.319 --> 00:07:41.399
you still have a good chance
of recovering.

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:42.600
Besides,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.480
who else can I spend money on?

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.800
You're my wife.

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:46.879
Get lost, Lin Shan.

00:07:47.079 --> 00:07:48.759
I told you my legs won't recover.

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:50.199
Stop wasting money.

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:51.160
Are you insane?

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:51.800
Get out now.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.600
Alright.

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:55.480
I know you want me

00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:56.480
gone.

00:07:57.279 --> 00:07:58.240
But now,

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.839
eat your meal.

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:02.000
After you eat and exercise,

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:03.439
I'll get lost.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.920
Come on.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.519
You know Lin Shan?

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.959
We're from the same village

00:08:17.319 --> 00:08:18.399
and he visits often.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.480
What's he like?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Just asking.

00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:25.279
I'm Lin Fang's classmate.

00:08:25.399 --> 00:08:27.079
I'm here on business and paying respect.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:29.879
Lin Shan

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.439
is not a bad guy.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:32.840
But

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:35.399
every village

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.039
has its troublemakers.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:38.759
His parents died young.

00:08:38.879 --> 00:08:39.720
They had no money.

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:40.879
That little land

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.200
doesn't rent for much.

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:43.240
Years ago,

00:08:43.519 --> 00:08:44.799
he worked out of town,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.120
but came back

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:46.840
for his sister.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.360
What does his wife do?

00:08:49.919 --> 00:08:51.960
He doesn't have a wife.

00:08:52.879 --> 00:08:53.559
Zhang Xiaohong

00:08:54.039 --> 00:08:55.399
used to be our town's

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.080
belle.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.360
A few years back,
she went to work in the south.

00:08:59.399 --> 00:09:01.480
They said she was at a nightclub.

00:09:02.159 --> 00:09:02.879
Two years ago,

00:09:03.799 --> 00:09:05.120
she fell down some stairs

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.000
and became

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.200
partially paralyzed.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.000
She's still in the hospital.

00:09:09.399 --> 00:09:10.240
Lin Shan

00:09:10.679 --> 00:09:11.919
has feelings for her.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.159
He keeps calling her

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.240
his wife.

00:09:14.559 --> 00:09:15.440
But honestly,

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.159
he's just running his mouth.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:18.759
I see.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:25.799
Sir,

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.440
Lin Shan gave you this painting, right?

00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:29.279
Yeah.

00:09:29.799 --> 00:09:31.279
He told me it's some

00:09:31.559 --> 00:09:32.879
world-famous artwork.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.320
A few years back,

00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:35.360
he owed me

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.519
a few hundred yuan

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.080
and used this as collateral.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.519
You got a steal.

00:09:40.559 --> 00:09:41.840
This painting would cost

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.000
at least 1,000 otherwise.

00:09:44.639 --> 00:09:45.279
Thanks, sir.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:54.368
(Caorong Community Health Service
Center, Health Center Labor Union)

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.600
I'm Lin Fang's classmate.

00:10:05.759 --> 00:10:07.000
Lin Shan is her brother.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.159
I'm here on business

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.200
and thought I'd visit.

00:10:12.159 --> 00:10:13.399
I know you.

00:10:14.159 --> 00:10:15.679
I watch your videos.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.120
Big Hui.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.360
The Logic Behind Truth.

00:10:21.919 --> 00:10:22.639
This is awkward.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.279
I guess I'm famous.

00:10:24.879 --> 00:10:25.720
You knew Lin Fang

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.679
or Lin Shan?

00:10:26.879 --> 00:10:28.120
Why did you come to see me?

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.559
Is it for a case analysis?

00:10:30.559 --> 00:10:33.080
What case are you analyzing?

00:10:35.559 --> 00:10:37.120
Ignore him. He's in a vegetative state.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.000
Grab a chair.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.559
Sit.

00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:39.440
He can't talk.

00:10:39.799 --> 00:10:40.919
I didn't come

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.519
to analyze any case,

00:10:42.759 --> 00:10:44.200
but to investigate something.

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:45.080
Could you...

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:45.440
Yes.

00:10:46.559 --> 00:10:47.320
What do you

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:47.960
want to know?

00:10:48.279 --> 00:10:48.720
Tell me.

00:10:49.519 --> 00:10:51.080
How did Lin Fang die?

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.279
From heart disease.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.320
When she died,

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.480
I was working down south.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.600
I heard she was also

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.279
working.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.639
Her heart gave out

00:10:59.080 --> 00:10:59.639
and she died.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.360
Do you know the guy

00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:02.919
she held the wedding with?

00:11:03.919 --> 00:11:05.039
Her brother mentioned him.

00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:06.279
A village boy.

00:11:07.039 --> 00:11:08.320
He made something

00:11:08.679 --> 00:11:09.600
of himself later.

00:11:11.759 --> 00:11:13.159
Lin Fang wasn't destined

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.080
to be his wife.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.799
You're saying her death

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.600
had nothing

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.039
to do with her boyfriend.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.399
How would he be involved?

00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:24.960
You're here for this?

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.720
Did her boyfriend do something?

00:11:27.799 --> 00:11:28.840
I don't know yet.

00:11:29.039 --> 00:11:31.759
I haven't found much.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.120
Could it be

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.559
that her boyfriend

00:11:35.559 --> 00:11:36.559
made it big,

00:11:36.759 --> 00:11:38.320
and thought she wasn't good enough

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.159
for him...?

00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:41.000
We're not making up stories here.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.200
I know.

00:11:44.799 --> 00:11:46.120
Don't you always say that?

00:11:46.559 --> 00:11:48.159
The Logic Behind Truth.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:48.759
Yeah.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:50.799
You met Lin Shan?

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.840
He said pretty much

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.480
the same things as you.

00:11:57.279 --> 00:11:58.519
May I ask

00:11:58.879 --> 00:12:00.720
how you...?

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:07.879
I guess I was unlucky.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.279
It's my fault.

00:12:11.879 --> 00:12:12.879
When people like me

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.320
refuse to live

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.519
a grounded life

00:12:17.159 --> 00:12:18.879
and try to rewrite destiny,

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.519
we end up with nothing.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.519
(I went to work
in Guangdong when I was 17.)

00:12:33.759 --> 00:12:35.072
(Factory jobs paid little.)

00:12:35.559 --> 00:12:37.960
(Two years later, a friend
told me to learn dancing.)

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.799
(Then I joined a dance troupe.)

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.799
(Not some idol group,)

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.080
(just a low-tier one.)

00:12:44.159 --> 00:12:45.559
(Sometimes we'd perform)

00:12:45.559 --> 00:12:46.720
(at corporate galas.)

00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:47.759
(Those were big gigs.)

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.000
(Usually,)

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.159
(we danced at nightclubs.)

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.720
(I'm an ordinary girl)

00:12:51.799 --> 00:12:53.879
(with no education or connections.)

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.240
(What good is it)

00:12:55.919 --> 00:12:56.919
(to be young and pretty?)

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.039
(When a rich man treated)

00:12:59.039 --> 00:13:01.240
(me nicely, I thought it was true love.)

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.000
So he abandoned you?

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.039
He once told me to jump off

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.440
a building

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:11.639
if he left me.

00:13:11.679 --> 00:13:13.279
Jumping won't solve anything,

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:13.960
Tracy.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.399
We're both adults here.

00:13:15.759 --> 00:13:16.960
Stop being childish.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.200
You know very well

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.840
my parents would never

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:20.840
let me marry you.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.240
That's not what you said before.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.440
I-I...

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.879
I meant hypothetically.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:27.919
Just a hypothesis.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.559
It was my aspiration.

00:13:29.799 --> 00:13:30.919
We could work toward

00:13:30.919 --> 00:13:31.919
this beautiful future

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.000
together.

00:13:33.679 --> 00:13:35.200
Even if my family arranges

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.360
a marriage for me,

00:13:36.879 --> 00:13:38.480
we could still be together.

00:13:38.679 --> 00:13:40.200
I'll give you 50,000 monthly.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.120
You think I want your money?

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.399
Let's not talk about motives.

00:13:48.519 --> 00:13:49.519
Let's talk reality.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.600
How can a girl from an average family

00:13:51.679 --> 00:13:52.759
with no elite education

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:53.840
find a job that pays

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:54.879
over 10k a month?

00:13:55.039 --> 00:13:55.879
I'll take care of it.

00:13:56.039 --> 00:13:57.799
I can totally provide

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:58.759
for you.

00:13:58.759 --> 00:13:59.440
Most importantly,

00:13:59.559 --> 00:14:00.840
we'll still be together.

00:14:00.919 --> 00:14:01.679
Okay, Tracy?

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.519
Is this being together?

00:14:05.399 --> 00:14:06.799
You're making me

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.759
a despicable mistress.

00:14:07.759 --> 00:14:09.039
That's not what I want...

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:09.720
Fine.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.519
Obey your family then.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.559
Marry your social equal.

00:14:13.759 --> 00:14:14.279
No!

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:14.879
Tracy.

00:14:14.919 --> 00:14:16.279
No, don't jump.

00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:20.080
You really jumped?

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.120
Truth is, I wanted his money.

00:14:26.039 --> 00:14:26.919
Being with him

00:14:27.159 --> 00:14:28.120
meant no dorm life,

00:14:28.559 --> 00:14:29.600
no sharing bathrooms

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.440
with roommates,

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:32.679
no cheap

00:14:32.679 --> 00:14:33.559
makeup,

00:14:34.279 --> 00:14:35.480
and no obsessing

00:14:36.519 --> 00:14:38.399
about buying discounted items.

00:14:41.919 --> 00:14:43.440
When I was dating him,

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.559
I almost forgot

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.360
that my family

00:14:49.799 --> 00:14:51.000
is from this town

00:14:51.919 --> 00:14:52.799
in this village.

00:14:59.759 --> 00:15:00.799
I'm not Tracy.

00:15:01.679 --> 00:15:02.720
I'm Zhang Xiaohong.

00:15:04.039 --> 00:15:05.519
At home, I feed the pigs

00:15:05.759 --> 00:15:07.200
and work the fields.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.600
Those fancy imported

00:15:09.679 --> 00:15:11.240
foot care lotions he bought me

00:15:11.919 --> 00:15:13.080
could only wash off

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:13.799
the dirt

00:15:14.519 --> 00:15:15.240
around my ankles.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.639
I shouldn't have daydreamed

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.000
or expected some man to change my fate.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.320
What a joke.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:28.679
It seems

00:15:29.399 --> 00:15:30.799
Lin Shan loves you the best.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.279
He's just a fool.

00:15:36.559 --> 00:15:37.879
Who are you to Tracy?

00:15:38.879 --> 00:15:40.200
I'm her brother.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.600
Why are you here?

00:15:43.159 --> 00:15:44.080
The police said

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.600
that I was

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.600
totally innocent.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.440
She couldn't handle

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.120
the fact

00:15:48.159 --> 00:15:48.960
that we broke up.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.720
But still,

00:15:54.399 --> 00:15:55.679
we were dating once.

00:15:57.279 --> 00:15:59.039
Out of humanitarian concern,

00:15:59.799 --> 00:16:00.879
I'm willing to give her

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:01.960
some support.

00:16:04.639 --> 00:16:05.720
What are you saying?

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.399
You think you can sleep with her
and just walk away?

00:16:16.879 --> 00:16:17.679
Buddy,

00:16:18.559 --> 00:16:20.039
don't put it that way.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.399
When we were together,

00:16:21.559 --> 00:16:22.440
I paid the rent

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.799
for her apartment

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.840
and gave her tens of thousands of yuan

00:16:25.879 --> 00:16:27.279
for clothes and bags.

00:16:27.399 --> 00:16:28.799
When she had troubles at home,

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.840
I gave her money to fix them.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.320
We've broken up,

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.799
but I'm still offering

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.799
humanitarian aid

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.200
when she's in trouble.

00:16:36.399 --> 00:16:37.879
Haven't I done enough?

00:16:39.159 --> 00:16:40.240
I did everything I could

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.559
as her ex-boyfriend.

00:16:47.399 --> 00:16:48.360
Here is

00:16:48.519 --> 00:16:49.360
100,000 yuan.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.080
Give it to her.

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:05.559
100,000 yuan?

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:12.920
I'll kill you.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.440
Beat him!

00:17:26.039 --> 00:17:27.279
I'll kill you.

00:17:27.279 --> 00:17:28.960
Beat him. Get him off me.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:41.696
(Good luck. Tomorrow will be better.)

00:17:41.696 --> 00:17:44.352
(Little Fairy, Be better)

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.480
My stay

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.759
in the hospital

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.039
must've cost

00:17:49.039 --> 00:17:49.960
hundreds of thousands.

00:17:51.119 --> 00:17:51.720
I have no idea

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.240
where he got that money.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.359
After what happened,

00:17:57.119 --> 00:17:58.200
my family abandoned me.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.599
Only Lin Shan was here.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.960
He calls you his wife.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.680
If I could walk again,

00:18:18.519 --> 00:18:20.039
I'd definitely marry him.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.920
I have

00:18:25.359 --> 00:18:26.519
long figured out

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:28.960
what kind of life

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:29.920
I want.

00:18:34.359 --> 00:18:35.119
But I know

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:37.640
I won't recover.

00:18:38.839 --> 00:18:40.119
Surgeries in Shanghai

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.279
or Beijing

00:18:41.279 --> 00:18:42.799
cost millions.

00:18:45.359 --> 00:18:46.319
I just want

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.920
Lin Shan to stop helping me.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.400
He had a tough life.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.720
His parents and sister

00:18:54.359 --> 00:18:55.240
died young.

00:18:57.759 --> 00:18:58.960
If he ends up with

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.079
a disabled woman like me,

00:19:02.359 --> 00:19:03.200
how could he

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.039
have a real life?

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.319
Big Hui,

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.000
let me join you

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:21.319
for the case analysis.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.720
Y-You?

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.400
I love watching

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.480
mystery dramas.

00:19:27.559 --> 00:19:28.640
And I've watched

00:19:29.119 --> 00:19:30.279
tons of videos like yours.

00:19:30.839 --> 00:19:31.920
I'll help analyze

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.039
and write scripts.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.079
I'm drowning in free time.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.400
I'm so bored.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.359
I'll think about it.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.319
Don't worry.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.160
I won't tell Lin Shan

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.279
you came to me today.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.079
Sure.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.279
Alright.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.559
See? I get it.

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:47.279
Tell me about

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.240
your investigation.

00:19:48.559 --> 00:19:49.839
How do I address you?

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.680
Xiaohong or...

00:19:51.799 --> 00:19:52.400
Tracy.

00:19:53.119 --> 00:19:53.519
Call me

00:19:53.519 --> 00:19:55.119
by my big city name. Tracy.

00:19:56.039 --> 00:19:57.519
Tell me about the investigation.

00:19:58.752 --> 00:20:02.592
(Awards, Zeng Jie)

00:20:13.599 --> 00:20:14.599
Hello, Master Zeng.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.880
How bad do you feel?

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.599
My mom came and left

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:19.720
the same day.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.839
You know how terrible I feel.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.200
Entertain me with it

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.279
over food.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.319
Managing in-law relationships
is the trickiest art.

00:20:32.519 --> 00:20:35.200
You know who handles this best

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.920
among everyone

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.640
I know?

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:39.680
My dad.

00:20:40.119 --> 00:20:41.319
His approach

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.359
is simple.

00:20:42.519 --> 00:20:43.039
He never

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.599
let my mom and grandma

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.000
stay together for too long.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.400
In that case,

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.359
I can't live

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.279
with my mom.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.880
If you want a peaceful life,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.319
keep your distance.

00:20:58.799 --> 00:20:59.759
It's the same for us.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
You like me

00:21:01.079 --> 00:21:02.200
not just because

00:21:02.279 --> 00:21:03.119
I'm smart,

00:21:03.279 --> 00:21:04.519
pretty, and young,

00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:05.400
but also

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.400
because we rarely

00:21:06.519 --> 00:21:07.680
see each other.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.799
If we spend too much time

00:21:09.839 --> 00:21:10.839
together,

00:21:11.079 --> 00:21:11.839
you may find

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:12.920
blemish flaws

00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:14.279
in me

00:21:14.839 --> 00:21:15.559
and I'd

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.680
find countless flaws

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.039
in you, too.

00:21:23.559 --> 00:21:25.400
Stop stressing over this.

00:21:25.599 --> 00:21:26.400
Anyway,

00:21:26.599 --> 00:21:28.279
you're already getting divorced.

00:21:30.279 --> 00:21:31.359
(I drafted a letter)

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.720
(and invited)

00:21:33.359 --> 00:21:34.680
(the White Horse General)

00:21:35.039 --> 00:21:38.119
(to the banquet today.)

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.720
- What are you looking for?
- A book to read.

00:21:44.319 --> 00:21:45.039
What kind of book?

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.119
I haven't decided yet.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.519
Reading always

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.599
calms me, though.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.000
Your books are

00:21:53.039 --> 00:21:54.319
way too sophisticated.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.079
If you want to feel better,

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.480
try reading

00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.559
power fantasy web novels.

00:22:01.519 --> 00:22:02.799
I won't escape reality.

00:22:06.359 --> 00:22:07.640
That's because

00:22:08.319 --> 00:22:09.519
your reality

00:22:09.759 --> 00:22:11.480
is enviable.

00:22:12.559 --> 00:22:13.000
No.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.559
That's because I fought for it.

00:22:35.079 --> 00:22:35.839
Shan.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.880
It was an accident, Shan.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.519
Hit me all you want, Shan.

00:22:39.759 --> 00:22:40.200
Shan.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.160
I'll kill you.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.400
My sister.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.640
She's my only sister.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.920
It's fine without bride price.

00:22:51.319 --> 00:22:52.799
But it's only been a year.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.640
I hoped you'd give her

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.519
a better life.

00:22:58.119 --> 00:22:59.480
It's only been a year.

00:23:00.759 --> 00:23:01.519
Shan.

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.559
Shan.

00:23:03.559 --> 00:23:04.799
It was an accident, Shan.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.279
Please.

00:23:05.279 --> 00:23:06.240
It was an accident.

00:23:06.359 --> 00:23:07.039
Shan.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.000
Shan.

00:23:08.319 --> 00:23:09.640
You'll always be my brother.

00:23:09.759 --> 00:23:10.519
I'll make big money

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.599
and provide for you.

00:23:12.079 --> 00:23:13.359
You'll make money?

00:23:13.519 --> 00:23:15.200
Shan.

00:23:17.279 --> 00:23:17.839
Things are

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.559
different from before.

00:23:19.759 --> 00:23:20.119
Look.

00:23:20.279 --> 00:23:21.039
My artworks

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.079
have won awards.

00:23:22.079 --> 00:23:23.000
I'll make big money

00:23:23.119 --> 00:23:24.079
and take care of you.

00:23:24.279 --> 00:23:25.039
Shan. I promise.

00:23:25.039 --> 00:23:26.079
Get lost.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.640
You'll take care of me?

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.160
My sister gave you all her savings.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.480
You expect me to believe you?

00:23:35.559 --> 00:23:36.480
Shan, trust me.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.200
Trust me, look.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.039
I swear

00:23:39.279 --> 00:23:40.480
things are different now.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.119
I've even been kept on as faculty.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.599
My works have won awards.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:44.759
I will make money

00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:45.759
very soon.

00:23:46.119 --> 00:23:46.799
It's all yours.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:47.599
Shan.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.440
Tell me.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.920
Where is my sister?

00:23:52.599 --> 00:23:53.839
Bring her back to me.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.960
I-I forgot, Shan.

00:23:58.119 --> 00:24:00.039
We were sketching in the mountains.

00:24:00.599 --> 00:24:01.599
She ate something

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.720
and suddenly collapsed.

00:24:02.839 --> 00:24:03.839
I had no choice...

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:04.759
You abandoned her

00:24:04.759 --> 00:24:05.839
in the mountains?

00:24:06.519 --> 00:24:07.079
I buried her.

00:24:07.359 --> 00:24:08.240
Shan, I buried her.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.799
How could I bear

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.160
to leave her out there?

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:11.759
Shan.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.359
I buried her.

00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:15.680
I buried her.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.240
I'm sorry, Shan.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:20.559
I'm sorry.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.200
I'm sorry, I messed up.

00:24:22.759 --> 00:24:23.359
I shouldn't

00:24:23.559 --> 00:24:24.279
have taken her

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.279
to the mountains.

00:24:26.039 --> 00:24:26.920
Things went wrong.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.640
And I couldn't do anything.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.920
You couldn't do anything?

00:24:31.279 --> 00:24:32.720
You did it on purpose.

00:24:33.119 --> 00:24:34.319
That's not true, Shan.

00:24:34.799 --> 00:24:35.680
It's been

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:36.759
a whole month.

00:24:36.799 --> 00:24:39.200
When are you going
to tell me if I don't find you?

00:24:40.319 --> 00:24:42.160
I was scared.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.440
Shan.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.359
I failed Fang.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.640
I failed you, too.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.200
Shan.

00:24:51.079 --> 00:24:52.839
I regret it so much.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.759
My sister died of heart disease.

00:25:20.559 --> 00:25:21.519
Her heart failed.

00:25:24.119 --> 00:25:25.400
Yes.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.200
That's it.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.759
She died away from home.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.319
Yes, Shan.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.519
That's right.

00:25:36.319 --> 00:25:38.039
Come home with me

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.559
to build her a grave.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.000
Of course.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.160
I'll erect a tombstone

00:25:42.359 --> 00:25:43.000
for Fang.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.599
I'll build a tombstone for her.

00:25:45.079 --> 00:25:46.400
I swear I will.

00:25:48.559 --> 00:25:50.160
Listen, Zeng Jie.

00:25:51.119 --> 00:25:52.839
I'm doing you a favor here.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.200
Do you know how to explain this

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:57.920
to others?

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:58.400
Yes, Shan.

00:25:58.599 --> 00:25:59.160
Don't worry.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.160
That's the story.

00:26:00.599 --> 00:26:01.440
Build her grave

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.400
by the end of the month

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.400
with or without her body.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.519
Okay, I got it.

00:26:06.599 --> 00:26:07.759
It'll be done

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.160
by the end of the month.

00:26:09.359 --> 00:26:10.519
I'll get it done, Shan.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:11.880
I got it, Shan.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.160
I'll follow through.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.119
Guaranteed.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.279
And prepare 100,000 yuan for me.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:17.640
Okay.

00:26:17.799 --> 00:26:18.240
Shan.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.400
As you say.

00:26:19.599 --> 00:26:20.720
By the end of the month.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.079
Listen to me.

00:26:22.119 --> 00:26:23.000
100,000 yuan alone

00:26:23.119 --> 00:26:24.440
doesn't resolve this issue.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:03.400
Lin Fang

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.720
never married him

00:27:04.839 --> 00:27:06.000
in the legal sense.

00:27:06.079 --> 00:27:07.640
That's common in rural areas.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.480
A wedding is considered official.

00:27:09.839 --> 00:27:11.240
Many people formalize paperwork

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.680
only to send their kids to school.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.599
This proves nothing.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.400
When Lin Fang died,

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.400
Zeng Jie wasn't married to Bai Xiaoling.

00:27:19.759 --> 00:27:21.039
Don't you think she died

00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:22.000
at a convenient moment?

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.400
Are you saying

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.240
that Zeng Jie killed Lin Fang

00:27:25.319 --> 00:27:26.240
to marry Bai Xiaoling,

00:27:26.559 --> 00:27:27.319
who's wealthier?

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.720
Wealthier?

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.480
Their statuses were worlds apart.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.480
Why didn't Lin Shan

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.000
suspect anything?

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.720
According to Zhang Xiaohong,

00:27:35.799 --> 00:27:37.039
Lin Shan spent about

00:27:37.039 --> 00:27:37.960
200,000 yuan on her.

00:27:38.279 --> 00:27:39.440
But that's recent.

00:27:40.279 --> 00:27:41.599
Lin Fang died four years ago.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.160
So tell me.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.119
Where did Lin Shan

00:27:43.119 --> 00:27:44.119
get the money from?

00:27:44.759 --> 00:27:45.759
So we need to

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.119
look into Lin Shan

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:47.960
for answers.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.039
You're pretty impressive.

00:27:50.839 --> 00:27:52.559
You visited Lin Fang's hometown

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.519
and easily got

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.640
all this information.

00:27:55.279 --> 00:27:56.559
I went fully prepared.

00:27:57.559 --> 00:27:58.279
What do you mean?

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.559
Check out my outfit.

00:28:04.519 --> 00:28:05.119
Wait.

00:28:05.119 --> 00:28:06.640
Why did we come here?

00:28:10.839 --> 00:28:12.079
Do you know this place?

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:13.680
Of course, I do.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.039
The bars sit

00:28:15.079 --> 00:28:15.880
across the street.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.119
When I first

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.279
graduated from college,

00:28:18.279 --> 00:28:19.400
I worked at an agency

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.720
and distributed flyers there.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:23.839
Seven years ago,

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.559
I won first place in the provincial

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.720
police academy

00:28:27.799 --> 00:28:28.559
competition.

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.400
I was so excited

00:28:31.519 --> 00:28:32.880
and told my brother.

00:28:34.119 --> 00:28:35.039
He promised to buy me

00:28:35.319 --> 00:28:36.279
late-night snacks

00:28:36.279 --> 00:28:37.160
after his mission.

00:28:39.079 --> 00:28:40.119
I waited till dawn.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.039
That night,

00:28:44.279 --> 00:28:45.200
he was killed in action

00:28:51.799 --> 00:28:52.759
right on that street.

00:28:58.319 --> 00:28:59.119
It's fine.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.200
It's been years.

00:29:02.319 --> 00:29:03.279
He's still with me.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.319
Say it again?

00:29:37.039 --> 00:29:37.839
I've signed

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.160
the prenup.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.839
Just add your signature.

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.119
I won't get any of

00:29:43.359 --> 00:29:44.519
your family's money.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.640
If we ever

00:29:45.839 --> 00:29:47.200
get divorced,

00:29:47.359 --> 00:29:47.799
I'll leave

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:48.680
empty-handed.

00:29:53.079 --> 00:29:54.359
Do you have to be so serious?

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.640
Stop laughing.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.359
Xiaoling, I know you don't care.

00:30:00.319 --> 00:30:01.359
Just sign it to reassure

00:30:01.759 --> 00:30:02.759
your dad.

00:30:04.319 --> 00:30:05.240
He hasn't said it.

00:30:05.519 --> 00:30:06.519
But I can see it.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:07.720
He's worried

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.960
that I'm after your money.

00:30:09.119 --> 00:30:09.759
Professor Zeng.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.319
Now you're offending me.

00:30:11.559 --> 00:30:12.319
I've got looks

00:30:12.359 --> 00:30:13.519
and a great figure.

00:30:13.799 --> 00:30:14.440
But you claim

00:30:14.799 --> 00:30:16.119
you're not after my beauty?

00:30:17.759 --> 00:30:18.480
Xiaoling.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.359
I've won over the beauty.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.000
Now let me ease your dad's

00:30:22.039 --> 00:30:22.640
mind.

00:30:24.279 --> 00:30:25.039
Besides,

00:30:26.359 --> 00:30:27.279
I'll be richer

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.960
than your dad very soon.

00:30:35.079 --> 00:30:36.359
Then I definitely won't sign.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.279
Otherwise,

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.119
how can I get your money?

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:53.279
It's been half a year
since we first dated. She's extremely

00:30:53.519 --> 00:30:54.359
happy with me.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.599
And she's

00:30:55.839 --> 00:30:56.599
relying on me

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.680
because I'm a university professor.

00:30:59.079 --> 00:30:59.440
No,

00:31:00.079 --> 00:31:01.480
I was just a teaching assistant

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.640
when we first dated.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.759
I became an associate professor
just last month.

00:31:06.319 --> 00:31:08.160
I've also won two international awards.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:09.920
Of course,

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.200
none of this would have

00:31:12.279 --> 00:31:13.720
happened without you, Ms. Juan.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.279
While dating her,

00:31:30.119 --> 00:31:31.880
I've maintained proper conduct.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.400
In fact, I had many chances

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:34.720
to be alone with her

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:35.640
early on,

00:31:35.799 --> 00:31:37.279
but I respected her boundaries.

00:31:37.839 --> 00:31:38.799
So,

00:31:41.279 --> 00:31:42.480
from the very beginning,

00:31:43.319 --> 00:31:44.720
I was aiming for marriage

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.720
as the ultimate goal.

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:48.839
But now,

00:31:49.559 --> 00:31:50.920
we have a minor problem.

00:31:51.279 --> 00:31:52.559
I've met her parents.

00:31:53.119 --> 00:31:54.599
Her dad is a businessman

00:31:55.559 --> 00:31:56.960
with extreme wealth.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.440
She hasn't said it outright.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.839
But I can tell

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.720
he's still guarded against me.

00:32:04.559 --> 00:32:05.440
He suspects

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.559
I'm after their family fortune.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:08.519
How can I

00:32:08.799 --> 00:32:10.559
tell her father that

00:32:11.119 --> 00:32:12.759
I'm an artist

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:13.759
and genuinely

00:32:13.799 --> 00:32:15.119
don't care about his wealth?

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.279
You don't?

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.119
Ms. Juan,

00:32:24.359 --> 00:32:25.000
you're

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:26.799
the only person

00:32:26.799 --> 00:32:28.000
I can speak honestly to.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.359
I'll just say it.

00:32:31.359 --> 00:32:32.960
If I marry Bai Xiaoling,

00:32:33.519 --> 00:32:35.319
I'll never have to struggle like before.

00:32:36.359 --> 00:32:38.000
Plus, she's young and beautiful.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.880
I can't let go

00:32:41.319 --> 00:32:42.759
of such an opportunity.

00:32:43.519 --> 00:32:44.559
But now,

00:32:45.359 --> 00:32:46.680
I don't know

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:48.920
how to secure this.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.240
Get a lawyer.

00:32:57.759 --> 00:32:59.160
Have her sign a prenup,

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.599
specifying that

00:33:01.119 --> 00:33:02.559
her family assets will never

00:33:03.079 --> 00:33:04.559
be connected to you.

00:33:05.839 --> 00:33:06.960
If you two ever

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:07.839
get divorced,

00:33:08.359 --> 00:33:09.680
no matter what happened,

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.400
you'll leave empty-handed.

00:33:13.839 --> 00:33:14.799
All the talk

00:33:15.079 --> 00:33:16.319
isn't as concrete

00:33:16.319 --> 00:33:17.079
as a prenup.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:18.559
Yeah.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.319
But...

00:33:20.519 --> 00:33:21.880
No buts.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.200
If she's

00:33:23.799 --> 00:33:25.680
genuinely simple, kind,

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.680
naive, and silly,

00:33:28.519 --> 00:33:30.279
she won't sign the prenup.

00:33:30.759 --> 00:33:31.400
Moreover,

00:33:31.799 --> 00:33:32.640
she'll fight

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.160
her father for your sake.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.039
But what if

00:33:42.839 --> 00:33:43.640
she signs it?

00:33:46.559 --> 00:33:48.039
With your intelligence,

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.240
even if she signs it,

00:33:52.519 --> 00:33:54.119
you'll figure something out.

00:33:55.519 --> 00:33:56.519
Her father

00:33:56.559 --> 00:33:57.799
is a wealthy man,

00:33:57.839 --> 00:33:59.240
so he can't be foolish.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.519
Even without the prenup,

00:34:00.839 --> 00:34:02.240
once he approves of

00:34:02.319 --> 00:34:03.279
your marriage,

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.799
he'll certainly establish

00:34:06.079 --> 00:34:08.119
asset protections in advance.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.280
So,

00:34:11.039 --> 00:34:12.119
you'd better propose

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.280
to sign the prenup

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:15.360
and earn yourself a ticket

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:16.400
into this family.

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:31.679
Stop contemplating.

00:34:32.079 --> 00:34:33.280
Success requires

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:35.440
step-by-step effort.

The director is so confident?

00:35:04.159 --> 00:35:05.039
You'll regret it

00:35:05.079 --> 00:35:05.639

00:35:08.079 --> 00:35:08.920
We're the crazy ones.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:09.880
We've graduated

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:10.920
from college,

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:11.800
and we're still

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.480
handing out flyers.

00:35:13.599 --> 00:35:14.519
Stop complaining.

00:35:14.559 --> 00:35:15.719
Jobs are hard to come by.

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.079
Besides, at least

00:35:17.199 --> 00:35:18.400
we get some base salary.

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.039
Base salary?

00:35:19.119 --> 00:35:20.199
Base salaries are shackles

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.559
for young people.

00:35:21.599 --> 00:35:22.119
You know?

00:35:25.519 --> 00:35:27.400
What? You want to go home?

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:28.880
It's still early.

00:35:29.039 --> 00:35:29.880
Let's go drink

00:35:31.239 --> 00:35:31.719
Let's go.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:32.760
You got

00:35:33.079 --> 00:35:33.920
the time wrong?

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:34.800
No, no.

00:35:35.079 --> 00:35:36.159
You didn't.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.199
But you thought

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.400
you had a girlfriend.

00:35:38.679 --> 00:35:39.400
Well, you don't.

00:35:40.159 --> 00:35:41.119
How dare you be late?

00:35:41.119 --> 00:35:42.920
Why would you marry him

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.559
when he can't pay the bride price?

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.679
You're giving yourself

00:35:46.679 --> 00:35:47.400
away.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:48.239
Brother.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.639
Don't call me brother.

00:35:50.119 --> 00:35:50.960
Listen up.

00:35:51.199 --> 00:35:52.440
I need money to get married.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.199
All women want a bride price.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.440
What are you thinking?

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:57.679
Brother.

00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.039
I'm not your brother.

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:01.000
Sir.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.239
It's a brilliant choice to make me

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.280
your legal advisor, you know?

00:36:07.119 --> 00:36:07.760
Listen.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.800
I'll take down those who

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.039
copy your products.

00:36:11.159 --> 00:36:11.840
That's right!

00:36:12.199 --> 00:36:14.239
Feel free to copy

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:16.079
anyone's product.

What's our goal?

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.920
No.1 in Caorong.

Alright.

00:36:26.519 --> 00:36:27.079
My brother

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.559
won the provincial

00:36:28.639 --> 00:36:29.320
police contest.

00:36:30.239 --> 00:36:31.039
I thought you didn't

00:36:31.039 --> 00:36:32.119
want him to join the force.

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:33.800
What can I do?

00:36:34.159 --> 00:36:35.119
Everyone in my family

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.880
is destined to wear this uniform.

00:36:38.159 --> 00:36:38.800
Stay alert.

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.480
I'll clock out early

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:41.559
and treat

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.400
