DEAR X

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:55.805
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.515
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.314
I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT, BUT COULD YOU
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED BACK THEN?

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:08.610
It was the same as usual.

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:15.575
My mom was yelling at me
to bring her more drinks.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:22.707
I got smacked a few times, then I got
scared and ran to the bathroom.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.651
Dad.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.113
Can you stop Mommy when she hits me?

00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:58.284
She lashes out at me when she's drunk
because you don't do anything.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.496
She's pathetic.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.499
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT YOUR DAD WAS DOING AT THE TIME?

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:10.338
How would I stop your mom
when she's drunk and acting crazy?

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:14.259
She threw a total fit, saying
she wouldn't agree to a divorce.

00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:19.639
It hurts.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:24.269
At first, he tried to stop her
whenever she lost her temper.

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.355
But after some time,
he just stayed asleep.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:50.336
Goodbye, my wife.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.485
Don't tell me you threw her.

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:21.159
She got drunk
and fell down the stairs.

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:24.204
I know you're fed up with her, too.

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.957
I'll get you a new mom.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.877
She's super rich.

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:33.880
Nothing like our poor family.

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:38.134
Starting now, you do as I say.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:43.014
Or I will throw you
down the stairs, too.

00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:52.333
Help...

00:04:53.584 --> 00:04:54.627
Ah Jin.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.047
Call an ambulance.

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:46.262
NAME: BAEK AH JIN
OCCUPATION: ACTRESS

00:06:03.946 --> 00:06:05.531
NOTABLE TRAITS:
ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:07.158
FOUND IN ABOUT 4 PERCENT
OF THE POPULATION

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.786
SHE IS A SOCIOPATH

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:21.589
SHE VIEWS OTHERS AS TOOLS

00:06:21.672 --> 00:06:24.342
AND MANIPULATES OR USES THEM
TO ACHIEVE HER GOALS

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:34.394
SHE HAS DELIBERATELY APPROACHED
ONLY MEN WHO WERE OF USE TO HER

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:47.240
SHE HAS NEVER
PHYSICALLY COMMITTED MURDER

00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:50.326
BUT SHE CAUSED THE DEATHS
OF TWO PEOPLE, BAEK AND HEO

00:06:57.792 --> 00:07:03.005
SHE STILL HARBORS
AN UNFULFILLED PLAN TO KILL

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.856
SHE IS BAEK AH JIN, AN ACTRESS

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:24.861
EPISODE 1: HER X'S

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:25.945
JULY 2016

00:07:26.028 --> 00:07:27.572
Hey, it's Ms. Kwak's birthday party.

00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:29.782
Let's go! Come on.

00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:33.369
- Let's go and have cake.
- Cake? I'm in.

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.037
- Come.
- Save me a piece!

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.789
Get me a slice, too!

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:38.082
So loud.

00:07:42.211 --> 00:07:43.212
How many?

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:45.882
No way.

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:50.011
Did you hear that?

00:07:50.094 --> 00:07:51.971
- They're getting married?
- Yes.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.308
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:57.935
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:01.564
- Happy birthday, dear Ms. Kwak...
- Happy birthday, dear Ms. Kwak...

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:03.774
- This is Singwang High School.
- Singwang High School.

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:05.568
It was posted anonymously, so...

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.164
What are these?

00:08:18.247 --> 00:08:19.665
Explain!

00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:24.003
- What's going on?
- What are they?

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.925
- What's this?
- Is this for real?

00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:31.344
- Who's this?
- It can't be true.

00:08:31.427 --> 00:08:33.804
What on earth have you been doing?

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:37.141
It's all over the school's website

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:40.436
so we're getting numerous phone calls
from the parents!

00:08:41.062 --> 00:08:43.481
You're placed under probation
until it dies down.

00:08:44.148 --> 00:08:46.609
We'll contact you
once the situation is resolved.

00:08:46.692 --> 00:08:49.654
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

00:09:03.167 --> 00:09:05.419
Are you all right, Ms. Kwak?

00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:12.510
Did you like my gift?

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:16.973
As you always pointed out

00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:20.309
I'm an underprivileged child
with no parents or guardians

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:22.353
so I couldn't get you a nice gift.

00:09:23.187 --> 00:09:26.399
But I put my heart into this one.

00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:30.027
I hope you like it.

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:34.031
Happy birthday.

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:46.377
SIM SUNG HEE, HER X

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:53.843
1. BAEK AH JIN
2. SIM SUNG HEE

00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:58.097
Ah Jin and I both got a two-point
question wrong, but why am I second?

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.142
There's a one-point difference
in the art practical test.

00:10:01.225 --> 00:10:03.311
You two have different ranks,
but you're both in the top grade

00:10:03.394 --> 00:10:04.937
so it doesn't affect
the overall outcome.

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:06.480
The art practical test?

00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:14.572
What's happening?

00:10:16.198 --> 00:10:17.867
Who is Ah Jin with?

00:10:18.367 --> 00:10:19.410
Our art teacher?

00:10:24.498 --> 00:10:25.833
You haven't gone home yet?

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.794
I left my umbrella in the classroom.

00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:30.713
I didn't see any umbrellas.

00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:32.548
So, someone took my umbrella?

00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:33.966
Yes.

00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:36.927
Move. Let me look for it.

00:10:37.678 --> 00:10:40.097
Come. I'll walk you there
before it's too late.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.775
You're a model student, indeed.

00:10:51.233 --> 00:10:53.110
Studying even in the middle
of all this chaos.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.530
But who were you with
in the classroom?

00:10:56.614 --> 00:10:59.158
Was it the art teacher who supervised
the evening study yesterday?

00:11:01.994 --> 00:11:04.413
You sure have a lot of interest
in other people's business.

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:06.248
But you're also completely oblivious.

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:11.170
You know, people like you
are the first to die in movies.

00:11:13.297 --> 00:11:14.382
Good for you, though.

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:18.344
At least in real life, you won't die
for something like that.

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:27.436
I got chills at that moment.

00:11:28.437 --> 00:11:29.897
That look on her face.

00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:32.274
That tone.

00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:35.528
Her true face
that flashed for a split second.

00:11:37.613 --> 00:11:39.240
Only I saw it.

00:11:40.491 --> 00:11:42.618
Ah Jin, congratulations
on ranking first in the whole school.

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:44.954
And Jun Seo, great job
winning the writing contest.

00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:48.666
Jun Seo and Sung Hee, you'll be
preparing for the debate competition

00:11:48.749 --> 00:11:49.917
so keep working hard.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.295
I'd like to give my spot
in the debate competition to Ah Jin.

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:54.380
All of a sudden?

00:11:55.047 --> 00:11:56.048
Why?

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:57.591
Winning the writing contest

00:11:57.675 --> 00:12:00.219
is enough for me to apply early
as a literature-specialized student.

00:12:00.302 --> 00:12:01.303
Is that so?

00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:03.305
- Have you talked it over with her?
- Yes.

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:05.349
I'd like to participate, if possible.

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:08.102
I'll check the eligibility rules
and let you know.

00:12:09.103 --> 00:12:10.479
Good luck with the rest of the day.

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:12.523
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:12:16.527 --> 00:12:17.653
2016 PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE COMPETITION

00:12:20.364 --> 00:12:21.490
The debate topic is

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:23.743
the pros and cons
of the death penalty.

00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:26.787
As you know, the first part is
a free presentation on the topic

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:28.164
and in the second part

00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:31.083
one representative debates
with students from other schools.

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:32.585
You only need to prepare
for Part One.

00:12:32.668 --> 00:12:35.880
Yu Bin can help Ah Jin with research.

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:38.382
Ga Yeong, you handle the slides.

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:40.050
I'll write the presentation script.

00:12:40.134 --> 00:12:42.595
It's more convenient
when the presenter writes it.

00:12:42.678 --> 00:12:43.679
- Sure.
- Sure.

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:49.310
Have you always decided things
this way?

00:12:50.978 --> 00:12:53.189
Ah Jin, we also agreed
with her plan, so--

00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:55.524
It was the same
in the last idea-pitching contest.

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.276
Sung Hee has good leadership

00:12:57.359 --> 00:12:58.986
so her way gives us
a better shot at win--

00:12:59.069 --> 00:13:00.154
No, she's right.

00:13:01.405 --> 00:13:03.157
I've been too assuming.

00:13:04.033 --> 00:13:05.034
Ah Jin.

00:13:05.701 --> 00:13:07.495
How would you like to do it?

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:10.581
I heard cooperation
among team members

00:13:10.664 --> 00:13:12.541
counts for a high portion
of the score.

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:14.960
To score well in that area

00:13:15.044 --> 00:13:17.296
isn't it better if we all took part
in Part Two as well?

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.760
She has a point.

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:26.430
Then let's think
about how to divide the parts

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:28.891
and decide next time. Sound good?

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.351
Okay.

00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:39.777
- Hi.
- Bye, guys.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.529
See you!

00:13:41.987 --> 00:13:43.072
Good work today.

00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:44.615
So annoying.

00:13:45.032 --> 00:13:47.034
Are you on your period?
Why the hysteria again?

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.828
She kept going on about teamwork

00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:50.538
and started showing off
the moment she walked in!

00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:52.081
Crazy bitch.

00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:57.837
Do you mean Baek Ah Jin,
who pushed you out of first place?

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:58.921
Mom.

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:02.466
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.719
I've donated so much to your school
every month as the PTA rep.

00:14:06.178 --> 00:14:07.721
You think I can't handle that much?

00:14:09.598 --> 00:14:13.102
Can you find out
what tutoring she's getting?

00:14:14.061 --> 00:14:15.563
What are you talking about?

00:14:15.646 --> 00:14:18.566
Ms. Kwak said she's an orphan
who can't even afford an academy.

00:14:18.649 --> 00:14:22.111
Anyway, I have bribed
Ms. Kwak so much money.

00:14:22.194 --> 00:14:24.822
But she got fired,
and all that cash went to waste.

00:14:24.905 --> 00:14:26.824
Not just money.
She said she needed legal help

00:14:26.907 --> 00:14:28.659
so even your dad had to step in.

00:14:28.742 --> 00:14:31.495
Who did she get caught
cheating with, anyway?

00:15:54.328 --> 00:15:55.704
Are you sick?

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:57.331
You're feverish.

00:15:59.583 --> 00:16:00.876
No, I'm fine.

00:16:01.752 --> 00:16:02.836
Go on.

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:09.301
It's past eleven. You should go home.

00:16:09.385 --> 00:16:11.387
I feel more comfortable here.

00:16:13.597 --> 00:16:15.641
Can I borrow your literature notes?

00:16:15.724 --> 00:16:16.725
Yes, hold on.

00:16:20.646 --> 00:16:21.647
Here.

00:16:33.534 --> 00:16:34.535
Jun Seo.

00:16:34.868 --> 00:16:36.745
Did Ah Jin ask you

00:16:37.287 --> 00:16:39.289
to give up the debate spot?

00:16:39.915 --> 00:16:42.084
No, I just thought it didn't suit me.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.795
Still, we're the president
and vice-president.

00:16:44.878 --> 00:16:46.505
It'd look better if we went together.

00:16:46.588 --> 00:16:49.049
If Ah Jin takes my spot

00:16:49.133 --> 00:16:51.051
it will help the team win.

00:16:51.135 --> 00:16:53.512
But you're a good writer.

00:16:53.595 --> 00:16:56.098
I'm sure you will be
of better help to the team.

00:16:56.181 --> 00:16:57.850
Can you say you'll join back?

00:16:58.475 --> 00:16:59.893
Let's talk about it later.

00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:08.027
She even gave you
something like this?

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:09.945
DEAR JUN SEO
HI, IT'S SUNG HEE

00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:11.196
Was that in my bag?

00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:14.324
I had no idea.

00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:15.743
YOU'VE PROBABLY NOTICED,
BUT I THINK I LIKE YOU

00:17:15.826 --> 00:17:17.119
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ME?

00:17:18.662 --> 00:17:21.165
Why are you reading it so seriously?
Just throw it away.

00:17:21.248 --> 00:17:23.834
THINK ABOUT IT AND WRITE ME BACK
I'LL BE WAITING!

00:17:23.917 --> 00:17:25.878
You should still reply.

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.298
I'll do it for you.

00:17:37.973 --> 00:17:39.349
Did you hear the rumor this morning?

00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:42.394
- About Ah Jin?
- She doesn't have a mom.

00:17:45.522 --> 00:17:47.691
That was about Ah Jin, right?

00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:48.984
Yes.

00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:50.652
Hey, Ah Jin.

00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:55.282
Yesterday, Sung Hee told Yu Bin

00:17:55.699 --> 00:17:58.160
that you live alone
without your parents.

00:17:59.661 --> 00:18:01.830
And she knows
Yu Bin can't keep her mouth shut.

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:05.125
It's not just our class anymore.
The whole school will know.

00:18:05.209 --> 00:18:06.710
What are you going to do?

00:18:08.378 --> 00:18:10.380
About the debate competition...

00:18:10.464 --> 00:18:12.716
There's not much time left.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.843
And we've been getting
complaints from parents

00:18:14.968 --> 00:18:17.888
saying it'd be too hard
to align opinions with a new member.

00:18:17.971 --> 00:18:19.389
So, the principal decided

00:18:19.515 --> 00:18:22.017
only the three original members
should participate.

00:18:22.643 --> 00:18:24.311
Which parent

00:18:24.394 --> 00:18:26.188
objected to my joining?

00:18:26.647 --> 00:18:28.690
This is my dad.
You've seen him on TV, right?

00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:31.860
- Yes, I've seen him.
- Right?

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:33.821
And this is my mom.

00:18:33.904 --> 00:18:36.532
- Oh, my.
- She's so beautiful.

00:18:36.615 --> 00:18:38.534
You look just like her.

00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:40.244
- I'm so jealous, Sung Hee.
- It's an article.

00:18:40.327 --> 00:18:42.121
- Your family's rich.
- Doesn't she look good?

00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:54.883
By the way

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:56.593
do you really have no parents?

00:19:02.349 --> 00:19:03.642
Ah Jin!

00:19:04.476 --> 00:19:05.477
Ah Jin!

00:19:05.561 --> 00:19:06.645
I'm sorry, sweetie.

00:19:13.193 --> 00:19:16.738
I heard you got dropped
from the debate team.

00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:20.117
Apparently, Ga Yeong
and Yu Bin's moms were against it.

00:19:21.201 --> 00:19:22.703
Are you into Jun Seo?

00:19:28.458 --> 00:19:30.127
Did he say that to you?

00:19:34.715 --> 00:19:36.550
He asked me to give this to you.

00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:38.594
He probably feels bad
doing it himself.

00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:49.188
NO ONE LIKES YOU
YOU'RE ANNOYING, SO STOP ACTING UP

00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:53.859
Sung Hee.

00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:56.278
The homeroom teacher
is looking for you.

00:19:56.361 --> 00:19:58.280
We just got a notice
from the competition organizers

00:19:58.363 --> 00:20:00.949
that our entire school
is disqualified.

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:03.160
They said someone made a report

00:20:03.243 --> 00:20:05.954
and that they didn't want
any controversy.

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:08.582
It looks like
we'll have to drop out this year.

00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:14.463
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE COMPETITION

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:17.591
BRIBERY BETWEEN PARTICIPANTS
AND JUDGES

00:20:17.674 --> 00:20:19.051
A PARENT OF A CONTESTANT
FROM SINGWANG HIGH SCHOOL

00:20:19.134 --> 00:20:20.510
BRIBED A JUDGE
TO ENSURE THEIR CHILD'S WIN

00:20:20.594 --> 00:20:23.138
THE SAME PARENT PAID OFF A TEACHER
TO SECURE THEIR CHILD'S PARTICIPATION

00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:26.016
THE STUDENT HAS BEEN ARBITRARILY
REPLACING OR EXCLUDING TEAMMATES...

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:32.064
Damn it.

00:20:32.147 --> 00:20:33.899
It has to be her!

00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:35.359
Because she was cut off

00:20:35.442 --> 00:20:37.736
she spread the rumor
and got all of us disqualified.

00:20:38.528 --> 00:20:39.529
Gosh.

00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:42.282
Don't worry, Mom.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:44.326
You know me.

00:20:44.785 --> 00:20:48.080
Anyone who's ever crossed me
always paid for it.

00:20:49.831 --> 00:20:52.709
I wonder what happens
to those who cross you.

00:20:55.796 --> 00:20:57.798
Aren't you the one who spread
the rumor that I'm an orphan?

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:02.803
Thanks. My school life just got
a lot more entertaining.

00:21:02.886 --> 00:21:06.098
I heard welfare kids like you
get free rice from the government.

00:21:07.224 --> 00:21:09.351
And your tuition fee is free, right?

00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:11.144
That rice you eat

00:21:11.979 --> 00:21:13.814
is paid for by my dad's taxes.

00:21:16.608 --> 00:21:17.609
Thanks.

00:21:37.629 --> 00:21:39.172
NO ONE LIKES YOU
YOU'RE ANNOYING, SO STOP ACTING UP

00:21:39.256 --> 00:21:40.632
IT CONNOTES FUTILITY...

00:21:40.716 --> 00:21:42.843
YOU'RE ANNOYING

00:21:42.926 --> 00:21:44.720
CONNOTES
ANNOYING

00:21:44.803 --> 00:21:47.639
Fuck, the handwriting's the same.

00:21:48.682 --> 00:21:50.017
That bitch.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.728
- HAVEN'T YOU CHECKED THE LEDGER?
- I'M STUDYING FOR THE TEST

00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:56.231
- I'LL CHECK AFTER CLASS
- OKAY

00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:57.733
Kim Byeong Jin from Class Five

00:21:57.816 --> 00:21:59.651
keeps skipping payments.
What do you want me to do?

00:22:06.783 --> 00:22:08.243
Follow the manual.

00:22:17.085 --> 00:22:20.964
CHINESE CUISINE DOWONJANG
FAST DELIVERY

00:22:42.569 --> 00:22:43.612
You.

00:22:45.822 --> 00:22:48.283
Stop acting so damn important, okay?

00:22:49.159 --> 00:22:50.160
Heard me?

00:22:50.744 --> 00:22:52.704
If you piss me off,
you're the one who'll regret it.

00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:55.040
You understand?

00:22:56.291 --> 00:22:57.459
You're nothing.

00:23:12.474 --> 00:23:15.060
So, you're friends with my son?

00:23:15.602 --> 00:23:16.978
He and I are

00:23:17.479 --> 00:23:18.772
pretty much brothers.

00:23:19.898 --> 00:23:21.441
I even...

00:23:23.527 --> 00:23:25.487
lent him 250,000 won
of my hard-earned money.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:26.655
What?

00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:29.199
Byeong Jin borrowed money?

00:23:30.534 --> 00:23:31.701
Take a look if you doubt me.

00:23:33.036 --> 00:23:34.037
It's an IOU.

00:23:37.749 --> 00:23:40.710
Apparently, he broke
a friend's headset or something.

00:23:40.794 --> 00:23:43.046
Anyway, it's 300,000 won,
including interest.

00:23:43.588 --> 00:23:45.424
He was supposed to pay back
5,000 won a day.

00:23:45.507 --> 00:23:47.426
But it's so funny.

00:23:47.509 --> 00:23:49.094
He vanished after ten days.

00:23:49.177 --> 00:23:50.387
You're a student.

00:23:50.512 --> 00:23:51.805
You should be studying, not this!

00:23:55.684 --> 00:23:56.685
Ma'am.

00:23:57.561 --> 00:24:00.105
Just tell me.

00:24:01.064 --> 00:24:02.190
Are you paying or not?

00:24:02.858 --> 00:24:06.027
The theory that humans are born good.

00:24:06.111 --> 00:24:07.571
The four virtues

00:24:07.654 --> 00:24:08.947
- of human nature are...
- Jun Seo.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:12.659
- Forget about the money.
- Jun Seo!

00:24:12.742 --> 00:24:16.621
...righteousness, propriety,
and wisdom.

00:24:16.705 --> 00:24:21.251
It's a concept that these four
complete a human's moral nature.

00:24:21.793 --> 00:24:23.712
Now, the theory
that humans are inherently evil.

00:24:23.795 --> 00:24:26.965
It shouldn't be taken to mean
that people stay evil forever.

00:24:27.048 --> 00:24:31.303
You were born evil, so you're evil
until the day you die? Not at all.

00:24:31.386 --> 00:24:34.431
The philosopher Xunzi argued...

00:24:38.768 --> 00:24:40.020
Sorry I'm late.

00:24:52.407 --> 00:24:54.576
I'll take her to the nurse's office.

00:24:57.078 --> 00:24:59.456
- What happened to her?
- Jun Seo's so cool.

00:24:59.539 --> 00:25:01.583
Quiet down.

00:25:01.917 --> 00:25:04.294
Gosh, this damn weather.

00:25:06.296 --> 00:25:08.590
I swear it's gone insane.

00:25:08.715 --> 00:25:10.967
Jeez, how many raindrops
per second is this?

00:25:11.426 --> 00:25:13.803
Man, I washed this uniform yesterday.

00:25:15.096 --> 00:25:16.097
What is it?

00:25:16.723 --> 00:25:18.058
Are you two skipping class?

00:25:19.226 --> 00:25:20.227
Why are you soaked?

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:21.436
Did you shower or something?

00:25:22.812 --> 00:25:24.397
Looks like you're the one
who got rained on.

00:25:24.481 --> 00:25:27.067
I'm sure I told you
not to talk to us at school.

00:25:28.777 --> 00:25:30.529
Just go to class
when you're at school.

00:25:30.612 --> 00:25:32.989
Who the fuck do you think you are,
telling me what to do?

00:25:33.281 --> 00:25:35.283
And you're the one skipping class.

00:25:35.408 --> 00:25:37.160
We're not skipping.
We're going to the nurse.

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:40.038
And those AirPods.

00:25:40.121 --> 00:25:42.249
Shouldn't you be keeping
those out of sight?

00:25:47.754 --> 00:25:49.130
Aren't these expensive?

00:25:56.012 --> 00:25:57.514
You swear you won't tell anyone?

00:25:57.931 --> 00:25:58.974
Why?

00:25:59.057 --> 00:26:01.601
I don't want to get involved
in something that's not my problem.

00:26:01.685 --> 00:26:02.811
A model student like you

00:26:02.894 --> 00:26:04.854
wouldn't gain anything
from getting involved with me.

00:26:06.314 --> 00:26:07.524
You need anything?

00:26:07.607 --> 00:26:09.234
If you want something

00:26:09.317 --> 00:26:10.652
I can steal one for you.

00:26:12.195 --> 00:26:15.240
I don't need stuff.
But I do need a person.

00:26:15.907 --> 00:26:17.909
- A person?
- It's a perfect fit for you.

00:26:18.285 --> 00:26:20.203
This is good. You'll even get paid.

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.582
160,000 WON
BONG SU HUN, CLASS 2-8

00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:26.418
BOSS

00:26:26.501 --> 00:26:28.670
I'm going home
after I'm done in the nurse's office.

00:26:28.753 --> 00:26:30.589
I'll check the ledger tomorrow.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.844
You're not even pretending
to pay attention now?

00:26:35.927 --> 00:26:37.387
What's this?

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:38.555
"Touch me and you're dead"?

00:26:38.638 --> 00:26:40.056
What's this, Jae Oh?

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:41.433
You punk.

00:26:42.517 --> 00:26:43.727
Jeez.

00:26:44.352 --> 00:26:45.812
Stop!

00:26:45.895 --> 00:26:49.399
You're dead when I catch you!

00:26:51.276 --> 00:26:52.277
What just happened?

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.165
What is this?

00:27:06.374 --> 00:27:08.460
PRESS TO UNLOCK

00:27:11.921 --> 00:27:13.131
"Collections"?

00:27:13.214 --> 00:27:14.341
I'LL CHECK THE LEDGER TOMORROW

00:27:14.424 --> 00:27:15.925
"Ledger"?

00:27:18.678 --> 00:27:19.763
What is this about?

00:27:19.888 --> 00:27:20.889
Sim Sung Hee?

00:27:21.598 --> 00:27:23.058
Why would she do that to you?

00:27:23.975 --> 00:27:25.018
Why do you think?

00:27:25.894 --> 00:27:28.229
She can't stand seeing me
hang out with you.

00:27:31.858 --> 00:27:33.943
Whatever her reason is,
this is too much.

00:27:34.027 --> 00:27:35.153
Let's tell the teacher.

00:27:35.236 --> 00:27:36.529
Forget it. I'm not a child.

00:27:37.572 --> 00:27:40.325
She's been spreading rumors
about me, anyway.

00:27:40.784 --> 00:27:42.327
I'll handle it my way.

00:27:44.663 --> 00:27:46.247
You should lie down.

00:27:46.665 --> 00:27:48.166
Your hair's still wet.

00:27:49.417 --> 00:27:50.877
You'll catch a cold.

00:27:54.047 --> 00:27:55.131
Jun Seo.

00:27:56.758 --> 00:27:58.343
To be honest, I'm scared.

00:28:00.553 --> 00:28:02.222
I don't know what she'll do next.

00:28:05.016 --> 00:28:06.267
You'll help me, right?

00:28:29.374 --> 00:28:30.542
Baek Ah Jin!

00:28:31.126 --> 00:28:33.586
Ah Jin, good morning!

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:35.046
Are you feeling okay?

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:37.215
I'm totally fine. Thanks for asking.

00:28:38.007 --> 00:28:39.008
Hey.

00:28:39.384 --> 00:28:41.553
You didn't hear since you left
early yesterday, right?

00:28:41.636 --> 00:28:44.973
It turns out Jae Oh has been running
a loan-sharking scheme with students

00:28:45.056 --> 00:28:47.600
and the ethics teacher
caught him yesterday.

00:28:47.684 --> 00:28:49.561
And the total amount was huge.

00:28:49.644 --> 00:28:50.979
The homeroom teacher yelled so loudly

00:28:51.062 --> 00:28:52.856
- that it echoed through the hallway.
- It did.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.441
Is that right?

00:29:13.376 --> 00:29:14.377
Hey, there.

00:29:18.965 --> 00:29:22.010
I was going to just leave
after five more minutes.

00:29:30.059 --> 00:29:31.352
You get the situation, right?

00:29:33.855 --> 00:29:34.981
But still

00:29:35.523 --> 00:29:37.567
I never said your name.

00:29:38.401 --> 00:29:39.944
Now, I don't owe you anything--

00:29:52.415 --> 00:29:53.541
Thanks.

00:29:55.084 --> 00:29:57.796
I knew you'd do that for me.

00:30:07.889 --> 00:30:09.516
Wait.

00:30:09.599 --> 00:30:10.767
My ribs.

00:30:16.439 --> 00:30:17.649
Did you get hit again?

00:30:27.075 --> 00:30:28.493
I honestly don't get it.

00:30:30.036 --> 00:30:31.538
Every time you get hit by your father

00:30:31.621 --> 00:30:34.123
it makes me angry
because you look so pathetic.

00:30:36.751 --> 00:30:38.628
Aren't you sick of living like that?

00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:43.216
If it were me, I would find a way
to get away from him.

00:30:44.259 --> 00:30:46.344
Not just let him hit you
like an idiot.

00:30:46.427 --> 00:30:48.471
I never knew
you were so interested in me.

00:30:49.389 --> 00:30:50.390
No wonder.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.893
I knew you were looking at me
in a strange way.

00:30:53.977 --> 00:30:55.395
I looked pathetic to you.

00:30:56.396 --> 00:30:57.397
Is that it?

00:31:00.441 --> 00:31:02.569
I'm only letting him hit me.

00:31:03.611 --> 00:31:06.030
Or he'll go and make trouble
somewhere else.

00:31:07.282 --> 00:31:10.159
And no matter how useless I am

00:31:10.577 --> 00:31:12.161
I can't beat up my own parent.

00:31:12.495 --> 00:31:13.997
Yes, you can.

00:31:15.957 --> 00:31:18.084
What's so wrong
with protecting yourself?

00:31:21.838 --> 00:31:22.839
Jae Oh.

00:31:24.632 --> 00:31:26.342
You're not useless.

00:31:27.135 --> 00:31:28.428
At least, not to me.

00:32:04.631 --> 00:32:07.800
- It's finally lunchtime.
- I was starving!

00:32:08.384 --> 00:32:11.471
Can I get one more?
I love grilled patties.

00:32:11.804 --> 00:32:13.556
Thank you, ma'am.

00:32:14.474 --> 00:32:15.975
Why do you have four patties?

00:32:16.392 --> 00:32:18.019
Because the lunch lady loves me.

00:32:18.102 --> 00:32:19.979
Right, Ah Jin.
You'll chip in, too, right?

00:32:20.063 --> 00:32:21.272
For our teacher's wedding gift.

00:32:21.356 --> 00:32:23.149
Of course, I will.

00:32:23.232 --> 00:32:25.443
She'll be so happy, right?

00:32:25.526 --> 00:32:26.527
Oh, my.

00:32:30.573 --> 00:32:32.825
No, you do not pay.

00:32:32.909 --> 00:32:34.077
Are you out of your mind?

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.703
- What are you doing?
- Sung Hee!

00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:37.872
Ah Jin, are you okay?
It splashed everywhere.

00:32:37.956 --> 00:32:40.249
I'm fine, guys. I'll head out first.

00:32:44.379 --> 00:32:46.005
- Hey, Ah Jin!
- Ah Jin!

00:32:57.642 --> 00:32:59.519
So, you're Kim Jae Oh's boss.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.526
You just got caught.

00:33:08.861 --> 00:33:09.862
By me.

00:33:10.947 --> 00:33:12.323
You really are his boss.

00:33:12.407 --> 00:33:16.119
You're the mastermind
behind Kim Jae Oh's scheme.

00:33:16.869 --> 00:33:18.496
You act like a perfect student

00:33:18.579 --> 00:33:21.290
then shake kids down for cash
behind their backs.

00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:24.210
Imagine how happy
the homeroom teacher will be

00:33:24.877 --> 00:33:26.879
when she hears the gift was paid for
with dirty money.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:28.881
Right?

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:32.135
What now?

00:33:32.885 --> 00:33:35.096
You'll absolutely hate
coming to school now.

00:33:39.726 --> 00:33:41.269
- Hey, stop right there.
- Sung Hee.

00:33:43.479 --> 00:33:44.647
Do you have a minute?

00:33:48.776 --> 00:33:50.153
What do you want to talk about?

00:33:53.114 --> 00:33:54.782
It's about your letter.

00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:58.202
You probably know already,
but Ah Jin answered on her own.

00:34:00.288 --> 00:34:01.873
I apologize on her behalf.

00:34:02.874 --> 00:34:03.875
Sorry.

00:34:05.168 --> 00:34:06.294
Save it.

00:34:06.377 --> 00:34:09.213
Tell her to say it to my face
if she wants to apologize.

00:34:13.217 --> 00:34:14.761
I know you're angry

00:34:15.344 --> 00:34:17.472
but I hope you don't get
the wrong idea.

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:19.849
I like you.

00:34:22.393 --> 00:34:23.394
What?

00:34:25.229 --> 00:34:26.647
What did you just say?

00:34:26.731 --> 00:34:28.024
You said you liked me.

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:30.777
I like you, too.

00:34:34.947 --> 00:34:37.241
So, are we dating now?

00:34:43.122 --> 00:34:44.499
About that.

00:34:45.166 --> 00:34:48.336
The people I hate the most
are the ones who cross the line.

00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:52.715
I don't want my girlfriend
to be that kind of person.

00:34:53.841 --> 00:34:54.884
What do you mean?

00:34:55.468 --> 00:34:56.719
I never crossed the line.

00:34:57.261 --> 00:35:00.223
Things between you and Ah Jin
have been tense.

00:35:00.807 --> 00:35:03.726
As you know, I've been friends
with her for a long time.

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:05.686
If you truly like me

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:09.315
I don't want you to bully her
while we're together.

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:11.651
You're wrong.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.861
We're super close.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:17.031
Don't worry. I'm not like that.

00:35:17.448 --> 00:35:19.575
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:35:19.659 --> 00:35:20.910
Good, then.

00:35:21.828 --> 00:35:23.162
Are you free this weekend?

00:35:23.579 --> 00:35:24.831
How about a movie?

00:35:26.749 --> 00:35:27.875
What should we watch?

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.294
Whatever you like.

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:32.588
What I like?

00:35:33.381 --> 00:35:34.674
I like everything.

00:35:37.802 --> 00:35:38.803
It's me.

00:35:39.428 --> 00:35:40.513
Who's this?

00:35:40.596 --> 00:35:42.723
Who do you think?
Did you already forget my voice?

00:35:42.849 --> 00:35:43.850
Kim Jae Oh?

00:35:44.183 --> 00:35:46.686
I got a used phone.
Call this number from now on.

00:35:46.769 --> 00:35:48.062
Just telling you that.

00:35:48.146 --> 00:35:49.689
- I'm hanging up.
- Wait.

00:35:50.481 --> 00:35:51.524
Don't hang up.

00:35:52.942 --> 00:35:54.569
I need you right now.

00:36:05.288 --> 00:36:08.624
How come you mouth off to me
but let others walk all over you?

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:10.960
I think

00:36:11.252 --> 00:36:13.421
Sim Sung Hee found out
about the ledger.

00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:16.048
Found out what?

00:36:16.132 --> 00:36:18.718
Even the fact
that you own the ledger?

00:36:19.343 --> 00:36:22.430
And she has your lost phone.

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:25.558
I'll go get it right now.

00:36:27.768 --> 00:36:28.853
Don't.

00:36:30.188 --> 00:36:32.523
She already sees me
as a thorn in her side.

00:36:35.151 --> 00:36:37.403
It's only a matter of time
before the whole school finds out.

00:36:38.905 --> 00:36:40.948
They'll talk behind my back
when they see me.

00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:42.533
Fuck.

00:36:48.956 --> 00:36:50.958
Does Yoon Jun Seo
also know about this?

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.002
What is that jerk doing now?

00:36:53.085 --> 00:36:54.253
You know how he is.

00:36:56.172 --> 00:36:57.840
Even if he stepped up

00:36:58.591 --> 00:37:01.260
he couldn't handle
someone like Sung Hee by himself.

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:02.637
For now...

00:37:04.472 --> 00:37:06.390
I just need your support.

00:37:16.692 --> 00:37:18.945
Ah Jin, look at me.

00:37:21.781 --> 00:37:23.950
You know I read the room fast
because I live with beatings.

00:37:24.784 --> 00:37:26.911
Ah Jin, you said you needed me.

00:37:28.037 --> 00:37:29.038
You're smart.

00:37:29.121 --> 00:37:31.457
I know you've
already worked out a plan.

00:37:32.541 --> 00:37:33.542
Tell me.

00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:36.587
What do you want me to do?

00:37:39.715 --> 00:37:42.426
Guys, hurry and pay
the wedding fund for our teacher.

00:37:46.973 --> 00:37:48.224
You?

00:37:48.307 --> 00:37:49.642
- Hey.
- It's 5,000 won.

00:37:50.309 --> 00:37:51.686
I heard Ah Jin and Sung Hee

00:37:51.769 --> 00:37:54.647
grabbed each other's hair
in the cafeteria yesterday.

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:56.649
- Really?
- No, they didn't fight.

00:37:56.732 --> 00:37:59.777
Sung Hee suddenly poured
strawberry milk on her lunch tray.

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.612
- Strawberry milk?
- Is she crazy?

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:08.244
- I'll pay now.
- Ah Jin.

00:38:08.327 --> 00:38:09.912
I don't think you need to pay.

00:38:09.996 --> 00:38:10.997
Why not?

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:14.083
We have enough collected, and...

00:38:14.166 --> 00:38:15.418
Is it because of the rumor?

00:38:15.501 --> 00:38:17.086
- That I'm an orphan?
- No.

00:38:17.169 --> 00:38:18.713
That's not why.

00:38:18.796 --> 00:38:21.382
Do you know who started that rumor?

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.761
Seriously?

00:38:26.887 --> 00:38:28.097
What's with that response?

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:29.473
Is there something wrong?

00:38:29.807 --> 00:38:32.810
No, it's just random that you two
started dating so suddenly.

00:38:33.185 --> 00:38:36.480
He still wants to date you,
knowing you poured milk on Ah Jin?

00:38:36.564 --> 00:38:38.691
I didn't pour it.
I spilled it by mistake.

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:41.527
Not a drop hit her face.

00:38:44.864 --> 00:38:46.115
Anyway

00:38:46.198 --> 00:38:48.659
don't bring up her name
in front of me again.

00:38:51.579 --> 00:38:52.580
See you.

00:38:57.501 --> 00:38:58.586
What's up with her?

00:38:58.669 --> 00:39:00.546
She was always dying
to badmouth Ah Jin.

00:39:03.632 --> 00:39:07.470
Nice.

00:39:08.429 --> 00:39:09.889
How are things with Jun Seo?

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:12.683
You scared me.

00:39:13.642 --> 00:39:15.144
You two looked cute together.

00:39:17.897 --> 00:39:20.149
So what?

00:39:20.232 --> 00:39:22.068
I'm happy for you. He's a good guy.

00:39:28.991 --> 00:39:29.992
BOSS

00:39:30.493 --> 00:39:32.328
PASSCODE 1004
FRIDAY, 4TH PERIOD, PE

00:39:32.411 --> 00:39:34.372
Her passcode reads as "angel"?

00:39:34.455 --> 00:39:36.916
That crazy Sung Hee has no shame.

00:39:37.291 --> 00:39:39.377
Unbelievable.

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:42.797
FRIDAY
4TH PERIOD, PE

00:39:57.395 --> 00:39:58.396
Jun Seo.

00:40:00.898 --> 00:40:02.942
I booked the movie for the weekend.

00:40:03.025 --> 00:40:04.110
Thanks.

00:40:05.194 --> 00:40:06.570
I hate PE.

00:40:06.946 --> 00:40:08.030
It's hot and sweaty.

00:40:09.073 --> 00:40:10.991
I wish we could just do self-study.

00:40:11.409 --> 00:40:14.120
If you hate it so much,
why don't we skip and hang out?

00:40:14.703 --> 00:40:18.082
Tell the teacher you're going
to the nurse's office like Ah Jin did

00:40:18.165 --> 00:40:19.625
and come to the classroom quietly.

00:40:20.793 --> 00:40:22.128
Don't tell anyone.

00:40:22.211 --> 00:40:23.212
Okay.

00:40:32.346 --> 00:40:34.306
- Excuse me, sir.
- What's up, Sung Hee?

00:40:34.682 --> 00:40:36.851
I have a terrible stomachache.

00:40:36.934 --> 00:40:38.561
I also feel nauseous.

00:40:38.894 --> 00:40:40.187
You can't hold it?

00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:42.606
I tried, but I just couldn't.

00:40:43.524 --> 00:40:45.860
I think I should get some medicine
at the nurse's office.

00:40:46.694 --> 00:40:48.863
Okay. Go on. You can go alone, right?

00:40:48.946 --> 00:40:49.989
Yes.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:55.077
Okay, I'll drop by
with Seon Hui this weekend.

00:40:55.828 --> 00:40:56.829
Got it.

00:40:57.246 --> 00:40:58.330
Take care, sir.

00:40:58.414 --> 00:40:59.498
Bye.

00:41:00.916 --> 00:41:02.793
You always take calls here.

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.841
I heard your voice
on the way to the nurse's office.

00:41:09.175 --> 00:41:10.384
Are you feeling unwell?

00:41:11.177 --> 00:41:12.720
I feel a little under the weather.

00:41:12.803 --> 00:41:14.180
I see.

00:41:14.263 --> 00:41:15.347
Get going, then.

00:41:15.973 --> 00:41:19.185
If you're free

00:41:19.268 --> 00:41:21.979
could we talk for a moment?

00:41:34.742 --> 00:41:37.870
COME TO THE ART ROOM
MAKE SURE TO ERASE THIS

00:42:14.949 --> 00:42:17.243
SIM SUNG HEE

00:42:19.703 --> 00:42:20.955
This girl.

00:42:23.499 --> 00:42:25.501
Sim Sung Hee just left the classroom.

00:42:28.337 --> 00:42:29.338
Ah Jin.

00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:31.340
Do we have to wait longer?

00:42:31.632 --> 00:42:34.927
Sorry, I'm a bit nervous.

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:37.346
Just feel free to tell me. It's fine.

00:42:37.888 --> 00:42:38.931
Could...

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:42.476
Could you hold my hand?

00:42:43.978 --> 00:42:44.979
Your hand?

00:42:45.062 --> 00:42:48.274
My hands shake when I get nervous.

00:43:05.916 --> 00:43:09.920
I know you've been
looking out for me.

00:43:10.754 --> 00:43:12.464
So, I also thought a lot about it.

00:43:16.093 --> 00:43:18.262
About what you told me before.

00:43:18.721 --> 00:43:19.972
True Love.

00:43:24.018 --> 00:43:25.728
No freaking way.

00:43:27.646 --> 00:43:28.814
Back then

00:43:29.732 --> 00:43:32.026
I was looking out for you.

00:43:32.109 --> 00:43:34.445
Now, I understand your feelings.

00:43:35.195 --> 00:43:37.031
"Your feelings"?

00:43:40.075 --> 00:43:43.579
I was afraid my friends would
find out, so I tried to deny it.

00:43:43.662 --> 00:43:45.331
But I've been regretting it.

00:43:46.624 --> 00:43:49.460
It must have been hard for you
to tell me first.

00:43:49.543 --> 00:43:50.628
No.

00:43:50.711 --> 00:43:53.297
I just want you to--

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.591
I'll do whatever you ask.

00:43:57.217 --> 00:43:59.386
I think I'm ready now.

00:44:13.942 --> 00:44:15.402
Thanks for the help.

00:44:15.486 --> 00:44:17.279
It would have taken forever
by myself.

00:44:17.363 --> 00:44:19.365
Don't mention it.
It's not a big deal.

00:44:19.448 --> 00:44:21.784
The bell's about to ring.
Let's head in.

00:44:25.204 --> 00:44:26.955
But I'm not sure if it's all right.

00:44:27.623 --> 00:44:28.749
What do you mean?

00:44:28.832 --> 00:44:30.334
Didn't we finish the equipment check?

00:44:30.918 --> 00:44:33.128
It's not that.
You know I'm on duty today.

00:44:33.212 --> 00:44:34.672
I was going to lock up our classroom

00:44:34.755 --> 00:44:37.091
but I couldn't find the padlock,
so I just left.

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:40.177
You know our class is extra sensitive

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:42.179
because it's been broken into
a few times.

00:44:42.262 --> 00:44:43.889
Should you be announcing that?

00:44:44.306 --> 00:44:45.349
What?

00:44:45.432 --> 00:44:47.101
If our room actually gets robbed

00:44:47.184 --> 00:44:49.978
isn't it partly on you
for not locking it?

00:44:50.062 --> 00:44:52.606
If we never catch the person,
like last time

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:55.275
the classmates might blame you.

00:44:57.945 --> 00:44:59.780
You never know.

00:44:59.863 --> 00:45:01.865
Better safe than sorry.

00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:04.034
Man, it's hot.

00:45:04.118 --> 00:45:05.661
Changing out of PE gear
is such a hassle.

00:45:05.744 --> 00:45:07.037
Dude, you stink.

00:45:07.121 --> 00:45:08.789
Sung Hee, didn't you go to the nurse?

00:45:08.872 --> 00:45:10.249
What happened to my desk?

00:45:10.332 --> 00:45:12.459
Someone went through it.

00:45:12.543 --> 00:45:13.585
You didn't do it?

00:45:13.669 --> 00:45:14.753
Where's the envelope?

00:45:17.923 --> 00:45:19.425
- The envelope.
- What's wrong?

00:45:19.842 --> 00:45:21.385
The envelope's gone.

00:45:21.468 --> 00:45:24.596
No way. I'm sure
you put it somewhere else.

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:27.683
No, I didn't.
I tucked it in my notebook.

00:45:28.142 --> 00:45:31.603
I always keep it there.
It was there before PE for sure.

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:34.231
Sung Hee.

00:45:34.648 --> 00:45:36.233
Why were you alone in the classroom?

00:45:36.608 --> 00:45:39.278
I wasn't feeling well,
so I got some rest.

00:45:39.361 --> 00:45:41.405
How did you open the door?

00:45:42.156 --> 00:45:43.824
It was already unlocked.

00:45:43.907 --> 00:45:45.659
I definitely locked it.

00:45:45.743 --> 00:45:47.953
He says he locked it!

00:45:48.036 --> 00:45:49.955
You should have gone to the nurse
if you were sick.

00:45:50.038 --> 00:45:52.124
- Why rest here?
- Exactly.

00:45:52.207 --> 00:45:54.877
Didn't she tell the PE teacher
she was going to the nurse?

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:58.380
Sung Hee, just answer me straight.

00:45:58.464 --> 00:46:00.841
- Did you steal it?
- Goddamn it.

00:46:00.924 --> 00:46:02.259
Are you being serious right now?

00:46:02.342 --> 00:46:04.678
What if there's nothing in my bag?

00:46:04.762 --> 00:46:05.763
Then what?

00:46:06.805 --> 00:46:08.891
What if there's nothing?

00:46:09.266 --> 00:46:11.059
Then, I won't let it slide.

00:46:16.148 --> 00:46:17.316
Here.

00:46:17.816 --> 00:46:20.152
Look for yourself.

00:46:21.653 --> 00:46:22.696
Is it there?

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:23.906
Take a look.

00:46:23.989 --> 00:46:25.616
- Hey.
- There's no envelope.

00:46:25.699 --> 00:46:27.659
We haven't checked her locker yet.

00:46:30.370 --> 00:46:32.289
You even put a padlock.

00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:34.333
Is there something important?

00:46:34.666 --> 00:46:37.252
Important? There's nothing.

00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:40.506
Don't violate my privacy.

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:43.634
Privacy, huh?

00:46:55.395 --> 00:46:57.105
Isn't this my phone?

00:46:58.899 --> 00:47:02.110
I was keeping it safe
after you lost it.

00:47:02.194 --> 00:47:05.197
But you never came to school,
so I couldn't give it to you.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.406
Then, what about this?

00:47:07.866 --> 00:47:10.869
Aren't these the class rep's AirPods
and the cash envelope?

00:47:10.953 --> 00:47:13.330
- Is this for real?
- So creepy.

00:47:18.544 --> 00:47:20.754
Sung Hee, do you still deny it?

00:47:22.881 --> 00:47:24.508
It wasn't me.

00:47:24.591 --> 00:47:26.134
I swear!

00:47:26.218 --> 00:47:28.262
I've got no reason to steal them!

00:47:28.345 --> 00:47:30.013
It's not like my family's poor.

00:47:30.097 --> 00:47:33.016
You used to steal in middle school
due to your klepto episodes.

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:34.351
- Seriously?
- No way.

00:47:34.434 --> 00:47:36.186
Shouldn't we call the police?

00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:37.729
- She's nuts.
- That's crazy.

00:47:40.983 --> 00:47:44.403
Don't cry. It's not over yet.

00:47:45.737 --> 00:47:49.116
Baek Ah Jin!
I got caught in her trap!

00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:53.203
What the hell?

00:47:56.164 --> 00:47:59.585
She's worse trash than I am.

00:48:00.168 --> 00:48:02.796
You all need to know
what she really is!

00:48:04.131 --> 00:48:05.215
Kim Jae Oh's ledger?

00:48:05.299 --> 00:48:07.175
The real owner is her.

00:48:07.593 --> 00:48:10.888
It was all her, you fucking idiots!

00:48:10.971 --> 00:48:12.472
What are you talking about?

00:48:12.848 --> 00:48:14.099
Hey.

00:48:14.182 --> 00:48:15.392
That ledger's mine.

00:48:16.518 --> 00:48:17.644
Who says it's hers?

00:48:18.395 --> 00:48:20.397
Do you have proof?

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.232
I saw the texts on your phone.

00:48:23.025 --> 00:48:26.320
Stuff about collections with a boss,
with the kids' names listed!

00:48:26.403 --> 00:48:29.323
Do you think we're close enough
to text each other?

00:48:29.406 --> 00:48:31.533
I saw it, damn it.

00:48:33.535 --> 00:48:34.578
Here.

00:48:37.748 --> 00:48:39.374
Where are these texts, then?

00:48:39.458 --> 00:48:41.251
MESSAGES

00:48:42.044 --> 00:48:43.045
Why?

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:47.466
If it were true,
shouldn't they be on this phone?

00:48:48.342 --> 00:48:51.261
But this is my first time
touching my phone

00:48:51.345 --> 00:48:52.804
since you stole it.

00:48:52.888 --> 00:48:56.433
Fuck, it's starting to piss me off.

00:48:57.351 --> 00:48:59.144
You stole my phone

00:48:59.519 --> 00:49:00.729
and snooped through my messages?

00:49:03.649 --> 00:49:06.360
That bitch is in a relationship
with the art teacher.

00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:07.444
I saw it.

00:49:07.527 --> 00:49:09.029
I really did.

00:49:09.112 --> 00:49:10.405
They were holding hands.

00:49:11.365 --> 00:49:13.617
They were talking about true love.

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:15.160
It was quite a show.

00:49:15.243 --> 00:49:16.370
Sim Sung Hee!

00:49:18.872 --> 00:49:20.040
Ma'am.

00:49:20.123 --> 00:49:21.458
Watch your mouth.

00:49:21.541 --> 00:49:23.085
What a psycho.

00:49:23.168 --> 00:49:24.962
I'll tell you a secret, too.

00:49:25.045 --> 00:49:27.297
Do you know
who our homeroom teacher is marrying?

00:49:27.381 --> 00:49:28.757
It's the art teacher.

00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:31.051
How dare you speak of such a thing?

00:49:31.677 --> 00:49:32.886
Calm down, please.

00:49:33.303 --> 00:49:36.223
Ah Jin, you explain.
What is this about?

00:49:37.766 --> 00:49:42.145
The art teacher was really worried
about me and suggested counseling.

00:49:42.854 --> 00:49:46.400
He introduced me
to the True Love Counseling Center.

00:49:47.943 --> 00:49:50.070
- She must have heard that.
- What a liar.

00:49:50.654 --> 00:49:54.116
You heard that and claimed

00:49:54.199 --> 00:49:57.369
that they were in a relationship
and caused this scene?

00:49:57.452 --> 00:50:00.330
Also, did you really steal all these?
Answer me!

00:50:00.414 --> 00:50:02.416
No, I didn't!

00:50:02.499 --> 00:50:05.002
You were the only one
in the classroom during PE.

00:50:05.085 --> 00:50:07.546
Why were you here alone
if you had no reason to steal?

00:50:07.629 --> 00:50:10.048
I heard you told the PE teacher
you were going to the nurse!

00:50:14.302 --> 00:50:15.303
That's...

00:50:17.764 --> 00:50:19.516
I was supposed to meet Jun Seo.

00:50:20.392 --> 00:50:21.393
Yoon Jun Seo.

00:50:22.769 --> 00:50:23.812
Is this true?

00:50:25.272 --> 00:50:29.443
I was in the equipment room
the whole time with the PE captain.

00:50:29.526 --> 00:50:30.569
He was.

00:50:31.194 --> 00:50:33.321
How could you do this to me?

00:50:37.576 --> 00:50:39.369
How could you do this to me, Jun Seo?

00:50:41.913 --> 00:50:45.876
I warned you
to quit messing with Ah Jin.

00:50:53.091 --> 00:50:54.801
That's it, Sung Hee.

00:50:54.885 --> 00:50:56.011
Come with me.

00:50:57.679 --> 00:50:58.680
Now!

00:50:59.931 --> 00:51:02.142
I'm not going!

00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:07.773
- That was epic.
- I know, right?

00:51:07.856 --> 00:51:09.316
- Should we post this online?
- Post it.

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:21.828
Aren't these the class rep's AirPods
and the cash envelope?

00:51:21.912 --> 00:51:23.330
I swear!

00:51:23.413 --> 00:51:25.415
I've got no reason to steal them!

00:51:25.499 --> 00:51:27.292
It's not like my family's poor.

00:51:27.375 --> 00:51:30.462
You used to steal in middle school
due to your klepto episodes.

00:51:37.219 --> 00:51:40.597
THE TRUTH OF SIM SUNG HEE,
ATTORNEY SIM GEUN SEOP'S DAUGHTER

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:43.266
SHE TRIED TO GET ALONG WITH HER
CLASSMATES UNLIKE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL

00:51:43.350 --> 00:51:46.478
SIM GEUN SEOP

00:51:46.561 --> 00:51:52.776
WORRY ABOUT YOUR OWN FAMILY

00:51:52.859 --> 00:51:58.281
THE TRUTH OF SIM GEUN SEOP'S DAUGHTER

00:52:02.953 --> 00:52:03.954
COMPLETE

00:52:04.037 --> 00:52:05.330
LEGAL CONSULTING PROFESSIONALS

00:52:05.413 --> 00:52:07.749
WORRY ABOUT YOUR OWN FAMILY

00:52:07.833 --> 00:52:10.710
THE TRUTH OF SIM GEUN SEOP'S DAUGHTER

00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:11.837
YOU DON'T GET TO CRITICIZE CRIMINALS

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:13.088
TEACH YOUR DAUGHTER
SOME DECENCY FIRST

00:52:13.171 --> 00:52:15.423
STILL GOING TO PRACTICE LAW
AFTER THIS?

00:52:15.507 --> 00:52:16.800
She's not my child!

00:52:16.883 --> 00:52:19.594
How could you do this to me?
Did you have fun with that woman?

00:52:19.678 --> 00:52:21.012
"Have fun"?

00:52:21.096 --> 00:52:22.514
Keep your dignity, okay?

00:52:22.597 --> 00:52:24.766
"Dignity"?
Keep some dignity for yourself!

00:52:24.850 --> 00:52:26.476
Did you sleep with her?

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:41.825
- Leaving early?
- What?

00:52:42.159 --> 00:52:43.160
Get out of my face.

00:52:44.286 --> 00:52:45.912
I told you.

00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:49.666
In movies, the clueless ones
like you always die first.

00:52:51.293 --> 00:52:53.086
Shut up, you bitch.

00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:54.588
Because of you--

00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:56.256
Don't say it's because of me.

00:52:57.382 --> 00:52:58.383
This is all on you.

00:52:59.176 --> 00:53:01.011
You touched my stuff

00:53:01.094 --> 00:53:02.470
poured water on me

00:53:02.554 --> 00:53:04.806
and even trashed my lunch tray.

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:07.934
But I let it all slide.

00:53:08.018 --> 00:53:11.897
Do you think I don't know
that you framed me as a thief?

00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:14.274
If you had been a bit less stupid

00:53:14.357 --> 00:53:16.234
this might have gone differently.

00:53:16.818 --> 00:53:17.819
What?

00:53:18.153 --> 00:53:20.113
Do you honestly think

00:53:20.572 --> 00:53:22.741
that handwriting on the board
was Jun Seo's?

00:53:24.367 --> 00:53:26.620
At this point,
it doesn't matter who wrote it.

00:53:26.703 --> 00:53:30.749
What matters is
that no one will listen to you

00:53:31.541 --> 00:53:33.752
that no one will believe you...

00:53:35.921 --> 00:53:38.590
and that no one will like you.

00:53:39.841 --> 00:53:42.469
You psycho freak.

00:53:42.552 --> 00:53:45.055
You never once doubted Jun Seo?

00:53:45.597 --> 00:53:48.391
Did you genuinely think
he was into you?

00:53:50.018 --> 00:53:52.479
In your dreams, Sung Hee.

00:53:54.231 --> 00:53:55.523
That's why

00:53:56.358 --> 00:53:58.276
you should have known your limits.

00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:01.321
Fighting me only hurts you.

00:54:01.821 --> 00:54:04.199
I've got powerful parents.

00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:06.743
And you don't.

00:54:08.245 --> 00:54:09.704
Since you're an orphan.

00:54:09.788 --> 00:54:11.122
Fuck.

00:54:11.373 --> 00:54:13.250
- You think I'll let this slide?
- Sung Hee.

00:54:14.167 --> 00:54:18.004
Who do you think
Ms. Kwak had an affair with?

00:54:22.217 --> 00:54:24.052
That Ms. Kwak.

00:54:24.135 --> 00:54:26.471
She got fired,
and all that cash went to waste.

00:54:26.554 --> 00:54:28.723
Who did she get caught
cheating with, anyway?

00:54:28.807 --> 00:54:31.685
She said she needed legal help,
so even your dad had to step in.

00:54:31.768 --> 00:54:33.728
Did you like my gift?

00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:42.570
Once your father gets branded
as an adulterous lawyer...

00:54:44.572 --> 00:54:46.992
even his law firm won't protect him.

00:54:47.075 --> 00:54:49.452
His reputation will be tainted

00:54:49.536 --> 00:54:53.290
and you'll become the thief daughter
of an adulterous lawyer.

00:54:54.582 --> 00:54:56.918
Will your parents still stand
behind you when that happens?

00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:01.631
Can you live with that label
for the rest of your life?

00:55:02.757 --> 00:55:06.761
You really thought
you could beat me, didn't you?

00:55:09.806 --> 00:55:11.474
You can't, Sung Hee.

00:55:14.394 --> 00:55:15.895
As you said

00:55:16.563 --> 00:55:18.315
I'm practically an orphan.

00:55:20.066 --> 00:55:22.485
But it's not like I was born
without parents.

00:55:41.546 --> 00:55:42.839
Help...

00:55:45.633 --> 00:55:48.720
I just remember her as my first X.

00:55:49.888 --> 00:55:54.851
LIM SUN YE: HER FIRST X

00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:02.150
Sung Hee.

00:56:04.819 --> 00:56:07.614
Thank you for being my target.

00:56:12.327 --> 00:56:13.495
Truly.

00:56:15.163 --> 00:56:17.290
You made school life
so much less boring.

00:56:31.888 --> 00:56:34.516
What do I think of Baek Ah Jin?

00:56:37.143 --> 00:56:39.062
Her acting has
always been exceptional.

00:56:41.022 --> 00:56:43.983
She switched masks
whenever it suited her needs.

00:56:46.444 --> 00:56:48.488
She's a devil.

00:56:49.614 --> 00:56:51.574
A devil

00:56:52.742 --> 00:56:53.827
wearing human skin.

00:56:56.287 --> 00:57:00.750
DEAR X

00:59:20.807 --> 00:59:22.809
