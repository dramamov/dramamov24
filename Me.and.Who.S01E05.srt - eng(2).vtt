I promise

I won't ever leave you alone.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.643
Oh my!

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.840
How could you guys meet
before the ceremony?

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.720
Oh my...

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.120
- My apologies,
- Oh...

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.280
I couldn't wait.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.400
Oh...

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.900
You shouldn't do that.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.240
You're the groom, so you need to leave!

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.521
People are waiting at the procession.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:02.560
- You should be there.
- Come on.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.760
Quick, go!

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.840
Woo!

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.280
Hoo!

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.339
M.R. Suriya.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.160
Yes?

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.640
Could you

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.000
shout how much you love Young Master Apo

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.240
until I'm satisfied?

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.280
Oh, that's easy.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.160
I love you, Apo.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.200
What was that?

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.840
That's not enough?

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.320
I love you, Apo!

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.720
What was that?!

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.680
Suriya loves Apo!

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.680
Here,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.800
please scan to pay
instead of a cash envelope.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.000
Whoa!

00:02:10.172 --> 00:02:11.640
You're through.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.280
- This way.
- Yay!

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.840
Hi, Ashin.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.640
Groom and groomsmen,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.720
do the limbo under the gate.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.160
In parentheses,

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.120
show off your hottest move.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.400
Korn, Karn.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.840
Can you help?

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.440
We have to dance?

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.560
Yeah, come on.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.720
I'm counting on you.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.600
You, too.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.160
There!

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.640
It's your turn, Mr. Groom!

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.800
- There you go!
- Oh, oh, oh!

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.760
- Yay!
- Yay!

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.520
Thank you.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.040
This one is a quiz to see
how much you know Apo,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.840
- Hm?
- so it may not be easy.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.920
The question is...

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.040
Which picture shows Apo's lips?

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.960
If I pick the wrong one,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.480
my groom will be mad.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.680
So, you need to be careful.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.880
As easy as pie.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.640
The answer is

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.760
number three.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.680
And number three is...

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.400
Is...

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.680
correct!

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.462
- Yay!
- Yay!

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.240
This way.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.360
This gate

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.541
might be easy...

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.320
or it might be hard,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.520
since it's all about

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.520
proving your love.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.080
I have a question for you, M.R. Suriya.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.960
What do you like about Apo?

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.040
I believe this would be really easy

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.200
if your love is genuine.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.720
No way he could answer that.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.280
He doesn't even like Apo.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.920
When we first met,

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.720
I didn't like anything about him.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.240
How can someone

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.000
be so goofy

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.520
and only good at giving me a headache?

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.440
What?

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.000
Is he just roasting me?

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.440
But in the end,

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.560
that won my heart.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.080
I like him

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.440
because he's willing to do everything

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.040
without a care in the world.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.400
That includes his weird dance moves,

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.400
which I still find adorable.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.240
He just stays true

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.960
to whatever he thinks...

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.560
I've never met anyone
as genuine as him before.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.960
There is a lot more to say,

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.880
and it would take
more than a day to finish.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.360
I guess I'll have to spend
the rest of my life expressing it

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.640
'cause I like everything about him.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.000
Thank you.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.680
Yay.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.560
Getting through your friends and family

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.840
wasn't easy, though.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.480
From now on...

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.440
it's your turn to get through my mom.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.640
Huh?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.640
Well,

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.200
what do I have to do?

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.680
If you want Mother to stop spying on us,

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.680
we'll have to show so much love

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.400
that it's visible from Mars.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.040
Compromise with each other, alright?

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.560
Communication is key.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.200
May your love last a lifetime.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.880
Let there be give and take,

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.320
and always know when to forgive, okay?

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.400
Please take me under your wing.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.080
Stay together through
thick and thin, you two.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.400
For richer or poorer, too.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.360
Thank you.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.280
As of this moment, the grooms

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.680
may now exchange rings.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.920
Give me your hand.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.440
Thank you.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.640
- Kiss your groom!
- Kiss your groom!

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.040
- Kiss your groom!
- Kiss your groom!

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.400
- Kiss your groom!
- Kiss your groom!

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.520
- Kiss your groom!
- Kiss your groom!

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.960
- Kiss your groom!
- Kiss your groom!

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.240
- Kiss your groom!
- Kiss your groom!

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.480
- Go ahead.
- Kiss your groom!

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.280
- Kiss your groom!
- Kiss your groom!

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.920
What's the rush?

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.000
The ceremony has ended.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.840
Why do I have to stay?

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.200
It's more like you can't stay

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.800
because your heart hurts.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.640
Hey,

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.240
what do you want from me?

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.120
Wanna go have a meal?

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.040
My treat.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:47.600
Okay?

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.520
Here's your food.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:00.720
Thank you.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.760
Shit, I forgot to tell her
not to put cilantro on.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.720
Do you want to switch?

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.640
I wanted the garnish,

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:12.840
but I ordered it wrong.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.560
What's with this guy?

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.040
It's a good thing, though.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.280
I don't have to pick them out.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:18.840
What's the matter with you?

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.920
First, you stole my table,

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.560
and now you're stealing my food?

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.400
Alright, take it.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.320
It's all yours.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.240
- There you go.
- Oh...

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.785
Thank you.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.040
Not a single matching chopstick here?

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.600
Wait!

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.440
Give me those.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:54.960
Excuse me,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.200
can I have one of your chopsticks?

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.718
Thanks.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:11:59.880
Here.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.883
Hey,

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.480
I could've just used the ones we have.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.000
You didn't have to ask the other table.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.000
No.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:11.920
Something in this world

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.400
is meant to stay in pairs.

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:25.810
Mmm...

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.120
The roasted red pork is so good.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.520
Here.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.720
What are you doing?

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.080
Help me with that.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.880
I don't like roasted red pork.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.840
Fine, I'll help.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.840
Wait.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:37.920
Are you okay?

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.640
Well, what were you gonna do?

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.920
I just have something for you.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.800
It's a no-limit credit card.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.720
Spend it however you like.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.040
Is this a black card?

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.480
I've only seen this on TV!

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.360
I will be busy for a while.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.720
I might not have as much time
to spend with you,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.920
and I thought it wouldn't be fair

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.440
to leave you home alone.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:10.880
So...

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.680
Feel free to spend it however you like.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.453
Whatever you want to buy or eat,
go ahead and treat yourself.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.920
It's fine, Your Excellency.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.040
I also have Apo's card.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.000
I know that, after all this time,

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.960
you've barely used Apo's money.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.520
So...

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.760
take my card.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:34.176
But...

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.520
Are you sure?

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:37.620
I don't want to bother you.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.748
Please take it.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.480
After all, I told the Yue family

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.360
that I would take good care of you.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.960
Thank you.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.240
If you want to thank me,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.400
then wear my ring.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.560
Right, one sec...

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.153
Here!

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.320
I'm not used to it.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.820
It's expensive,

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:12.940
so I'm afraid I'll lose it.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.080
Just...

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.240
don't forget to wear it

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.400
to my family's dinner tonight.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.040
My apologies for the sudden meeting.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.000
It's all good.

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.840
Thank you for...

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.960
inviting me today.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.240
You're also here, Master?

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.960
Is there a special occasion?

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.400
It's almost Daonuer's birthday,

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.680
so Father invited Master
to read our fortunes.

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.200
He's superstitious, you know?

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.800
You can start now, Master.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.120
Water...

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.830
No!

00:16:55.833 --> 00:16:59.200
I mean, Little Master Daonuer's birthday

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.680
should be held near water.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:02.800
I see.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.880
- This will bless him with health,
- Oh!

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.960
and bring good fortune
to Siao Tawan's group.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.600
- Oh!
- Ah!

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.840
So,

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.960
for Daonuer's birthday this year,

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:21.720
should we go to
our vacation home, Siao Sasin?

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.480
Great, Father.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.160
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay!

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.760
To the beach! To the beach!

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:26.520
Right,

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.320
M.R. Ya, Apo, think of this as

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.200
your early honeymoon, okay?

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.520
Do I have to go?

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.880
Yes, you do.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.720
You're my fiancé.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.760
Consider this our early honeymoon.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.840
Honeymoon?

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.560
Right, Apo,

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.320
so...

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.200
you can invite your friends.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.440
Tailah...

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.960
and Tor...

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.880
- Tor...
- Torphong.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:55.840
Right, Torphong.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.460
I see...

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.080
Are you afraid someone might
interrupt your honeymoon, M.R. Ya?

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.560
I'm not.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.320
I always let my fiancé get his way.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.160
Is he going on a trip or moving?

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.560
Ya is here!

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.040
Hi, you little monkey!

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.080
Tor, Tai!

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:06.640
Tor,

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.040
why did you have to drag me here?

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.480
Why did you make me
watch them being in love?

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.160
And why is M.R. Chan looking at me?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:21.920
Is he...

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.960
gonna tell M.R. Suriya and Apo
about the ceremony night?

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.040
Whoa,

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.040
I got eight presents!

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.360
Eight?

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.040
Are you failing math, little monkey?

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.760
Including the ones from our parents,
that makes seven.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.000
Huh?

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.320
It's not...

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.260
because Father and Mother

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.640
invited a special guest.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.520
Here you are, my sons!

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.440
Thanks for having me.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.440
Hope you guys don't mind me being here.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:54.920
Yi?

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.880
Who wouldn't be, Dear Yi?

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.800
You're not a stranger to us.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.880
Right, Dear Ya?

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.840
A special guest?

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.960
You've been acting strange, Po.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.240
Strange?

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.640
This is how I normally act.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.320
You look like a sad puppy, you know?

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.520
What?

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.320
What do you mean by that?

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.920
What's on your mind?

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.400
Mm.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:42.460
Oh!

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.640
I wanna know about...

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.080
Yi?

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.560
Who is he?

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:55.080
And why did Daonuer say...

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.560
he was a special guest?

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.270
I knew it!

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.520
Don't worry, dude.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Since you're losing your memory,

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.560
I, Torphong,
will remind you of everything.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.480
Okay?

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.520
His Excellency

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:14.240
dated Yi when they studied abroad,

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.480
but they broke up a long time ago.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.520
It wasn't because they fell out of love,

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:20.990
but because they couldn't handle
a long-distance relationship.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.840
Even though the old flames have died,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.880
if they're this close together again,

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.930
that might just be
the recipe for rekindling!

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.040
Po,

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.320
don't think too much of it.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.160
He just talked nonsense.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.480
That's sus.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.560
Normally, when I riled you up about Yi,

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.360
you'd be throwing a fit.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.560
Are you not jealous
of His Excellency anymore?

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.640
Why would I be...

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.080
when I'm officially his?

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.120
There, bestie!

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:20.680
What's on your mind?

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.120
Po?

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.520
Apo!

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.520
Huh?

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.960
What did you say?

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.880
I said, "What's on your mind?"

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.760
Right...

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.640
Nothing in particular.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.120
So...

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.400
Why did you follow me here?

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.200
Don't you wanna be with Yi?

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.400
Why'd you suddenly bring him up?

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.520
From that look on your face,

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.440
you've dug into our past, haven't you?

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:14.840
Nope.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.720
Are you...

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.640
jealous?

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.440
Are you crazy?

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.080
Why would I be jealous?

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:25.380
Look,

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.480
we're just a phony couple.

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.400
I'm professional enough

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.440
to stick to the job description.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.360
I wasn't even gonna say anything.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.640
It's pretty nice
seeing you like this, though.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.400
Looks like Lovesick Apo.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:49.240
What?

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:49.960
Hey!

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.040
Excuse me,

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.400
why are you standing here all alone?

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.720
Who's that?

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.040
Right here.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.680
Where's the voice from?

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:04.680
Here.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:05.440
Hey!

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.600
Right here...

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:07.720
Right here...

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:08.760
- Ow!
- Whoa!

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:09.520
Argh!

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.040
Hey, you...

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.100
What are you doing in there?

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.120
Daonuer wanted to play with the sand,

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:18.880
and this is where we ended up.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.360
Guess I can't get away
from this guy, huh?

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:30.480
Hey!

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:31.400
- Whoa!
- Hey!

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.240
I had a lot of fun the other night.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.240
Next time...

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.840
let's do it again.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.800
♫Being in love for the first time♫

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:11.600
♫Breaks my heart♫

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.080
Into pieces...

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.880
Get over it.

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.560
They are now officially engaged.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.200
You'd better find someone new
than a bottle of liquor to cry to.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.240
Should I...

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.120
steal Apo back?

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:34.360
His freaking Excellency
doesn't even love Apo...

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.200
I'm gonna do it now.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.160
Hey, hey, hey!

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:41.550
Hey, Tailah!

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.600
You're totally wasted.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.480
Where is your place?
I'll give you a ride.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.200
Why is this guy
taking such good care of me?

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.480
Is he interested in me?

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.560
I'm hard to get, let's just say that.

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:01.960
Ugh!

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:17.920
Let's see,

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.480
I'll win your heart.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.420
About what happened that night,

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.200
I promise not to tell anyone.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.640
It'll be a secret between us.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.640
Tell everyone if you want to.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.600
If you want them to fight over me,

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.040
then suit yourself.

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.000
That's not what I meant.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.000
Hey...

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.320
How about some coconut water?

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.320
Hm?

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:23.920
Come on, trust me.

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.440
There you go, little monkey.

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.080
- Oh!
- Alright!

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.240
- That's sigma!
- You like it?

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.000
What about yours, Dorky Po?

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.600
I gave you the field glasses

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.280
because I'll take you

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:55.720
to hunt for the Northern Lights!

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.400
- Do you wanna?
- Wow!

00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.280
Do you?

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:00.600
Let's go.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.080
This way.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.760
Sit there.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.840
Wow!

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:15.080
Dorky Po's present

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.440
is the coolest!

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:18.880
Do you like it?

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.520
I like it so much!

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.800
Daonuer,

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.440
you haven't opened my present.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.000
You wanna take a look?

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.560
Wow, Yi also has a present for you.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:32.600
Come on, dear.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.360
There you go.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:35.800
Take a look.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.840
- Let me help you.
- Whoa!!

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.920
This is exactly what I want!

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.240
You know me by heart, Yi!

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.520
Wow, that's a big box.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.160
Do you like it, dear?

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.800
I really do!

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.090
What an excellent pick, Yi.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.040
Don't think too much of it.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.680
The present, I mean.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.600
Daonuer was just talking nonsense.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.400
What's your birthday?

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.720
Why are you asking?

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.560
Ever since you said

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.240
we should get to know each other more,

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.120
I still...

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.920
know nothing about you.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.240
If I didn't read your mind,

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.800
I wouldn't know anything
about you either.

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.720
I was born on November 17.

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:35.700
What about you?

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:41.640
I...

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.400
I grew up in an orphanage.

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:49.000
All those cakes and presents...

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:51.600
I never got one.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.280
Then,

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.320
let's take the day
you woke up in this world

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.040
as your birthday.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:03.560
Sounds good?

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:09.840
Come on.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:11.640
Let's go.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:21.280
♫Happy Birthday to you♫

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.720
- Yay!
- Yeah!

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.200
Happy Birthday, Daonuer.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:30.480
Seeing you with this happy family,

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.480
and not being all alone
like I was in the other world,

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.480
makes me happy.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.520
You're not Apo.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.000
You're not Apo!

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.560
Uh...

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.720
What did you say, Daonuer?

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:55.440
What do you mean he's not Apo?

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:57.760
Uh...

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.000
he's probably sleepy.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.240
- Chan!
- Hm?

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.530
Could you help him get to bed?

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.160
Let's all eat the cake
tomorrow morning.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:29.400
A little mix of gin,

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:30.440
a splash of vodka,

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.480
lime juice,

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.760
and finished with some blue syrup.

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.520
Super Moon is ready.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.000
Let's take this to Apo.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.080
Hey, wait.

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.160
Can I have a glass of that?

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.520
Why would I give it to you?

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.400
I'm not your bartender or anything.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:23.600
How about a little wipe?

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.040
Apo,

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.600
mind if I join?

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.040
When I broke up with Ya,

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.720
I was devastated.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.680
But I would be even more devastated

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:50.040
to see Ya date someone else.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:54.840
Uh...

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.720
I'm sorry that...

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.440
I'm that person.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.200
I...

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.120
That's not what I meant.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.480
I just wanted to tell you...

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.760
I'm really happy
that you're that person.

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:15.040
Honestly,

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.360
when I first heard it was you,

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.040
I felt so bad.

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:23.440
But after seeing you today,

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.240
I'm sure

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:27.280
you will never make Ya sad.

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:32.200
Right,

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:35.520
I remember you're pretty good
at making cocktails.

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:36.560
Shit!

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.480
I've only made drinks
while working at Y MART.

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:40.840
Does a punch count as a cocktail?

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.560
Um...

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.640
I'm not that good.

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.880
Can you make me a glass?

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.120
We can toast to our friendship.

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.640
Seriously, do I need to?

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.640
Uh...

00:33:59.080 --> 00:33:59.960
Sure.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:06.360
What kind of drinks do you like?

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:09.360
Can I get something sour and refreshing?

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.900
Sour and refreshing...

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.120
A little bit of this,

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:20.760
some lime juice,

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.480
and some spirits.

00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:24.520
That's it.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:33.800
Here you go.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.920
Thank you.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.000
Oh?

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:39.680
Aren't you gonna drink with me?

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:42.160
I'm not much of a drinker.

00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:44.400
Did you forget

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.520
that you used to be a heavyweight?

00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:50.000
Now that you mention it,

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:51.400
I'm getting thirsty.

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.420
Just kidding.

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:54.600
It's okay if you don't drink.

00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:56.400
No, that's impossible!

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.560
To our friendship.

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.240
Mm.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:01.960
I'll get a glass, then.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.000
Sure.

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:09.840
Come on.

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.280
Let's cheers.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.560
To our friendship, right?

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.160
Cheers!

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:17.840
Cheers.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.440
That is awesome!

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.550
You can open your own bar with this.

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.960
I'm not that good.

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.160
It really is awesome!

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.240
I just tossed things...

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:41.280
Huh?

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:42.320
I mean,

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.000
I just did it casually.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.200
Oh...

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.160
Alright, it's nice to meet you.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.280
Yi, are you alright?

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:01.800
Hey! Yi!

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:04.680
Yi!

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.120
Yi, what's wrong?!

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.040
Are you okay?

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:08.480
Can anyone help us down here?

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.120
- Yi... Please help!
- Yi!

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:10.960
Yi!

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.580
Dear, what's wrong?!

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:14.680
What did you do to him, huh?

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:15.440
Ya!

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:16.920
- Come see him!
- Yi, what's the matter?

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:17.960
What happened?

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:19.280
Apo...

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.000
Yi...

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:21.600
Ya.

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.600
Yes?

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.200
Stay with me!

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.080
It's peach.
There's some peach in this glass.

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:32.760
He's allergic to peaches.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:34.440
Take this.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.360
I didn't put any peach in this.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:38.560
You!

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:39.960
You poisoned Yi, didn't you?

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.440
Calm down, Mother...

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.120
Apo really didn't know...

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.360
And when Apo made us drinks,

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.600
I didn't tell him about this...

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.080
It's my fault...

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.080
It's okay, Yi, you don't have to talk.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:54.200
Ya,

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.960
give him his meds for the allergy.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000
- Go!
- Of course.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:57.880
Come on, Yi.

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.120
- Get up.
- Can you, dear?

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.080
Just a bit more.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.480
Breathe.

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:22.880
Hey.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:24.920
Hey!

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.400
What are you doing here by yourself?

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.160
I looked for you everywhere.

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:32.920
You're still following me?

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.240
You're afraid I'll get in between
Apo and your brother, right?

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:39.960
No worries.

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.680
I won't steal your brother's fiancé.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.280
Who said I followed you...

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.880
for that reason?

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.360
I was scared you might jump
into that pool and not make it out.

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:15.280
Are you feeling better?

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.200
Yeah.

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:19.120
Thank you so much, Ya.

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:22.560
And...

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.920
Do you remember that time
we went to a bar in the U.S.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.560
and I had an allergic reaction?

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.920
It was so late
that no rides were available,

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:34.760
and you carried me on your back
to the hospital.

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:36.640
Yeah, I do.

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:38.960
I also remember
that after you got better,

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.800
my back hurt for a week,

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.720
and you ended up taking care of me.

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.680
I...

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.480
I'm sorry, Ya,

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.960
that I broke up with you.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.760
Honestly, I was a jerk.

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.040
I never thought

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.480
one sentence would be
the reason I never saw you again.

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.880
By the time we met again,

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.400
you were already engaged to Apo.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.560
As for this anniversary gift...

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.000
I don't think it's for me anymore.

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.120
I'd better give it back to you.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.320
I already gave it to you,

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.080
so please keep it.

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.640
Thank you, Ya.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.520
I'll keep it safe.

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:40.260
So...

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.720
just no more peaches, alright?

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.880
- Hey! Po?
- Tor!

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.520
Why are you here this late?

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.040
Drink with me!

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.240
Right now?!

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:02.440
Hey, Po!

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:03.840
Shit, slow down, Po!

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:04.720
- Easy!
- Chill!

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.120
Po, Po, Po!

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.000
Po!

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:08.720
Take it easy!

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.120
- Are you gonna finish the whole bottle?
- Leave me alone!

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.200
- Jeez!
- Stop!

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.160
Stop it!

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.280
Easy!

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.640
You can't do that. It's harmful!

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.440
- That's unhealthy!
- Po, that's pure liquor!

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.360
Here, Your Excellency.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.720
You can see for yourself.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:26.920
Thanks.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.640
I'll handle it from here.

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:36.480
Please don't bother.

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:50.440
Who's this?!

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.120
Let go of me...

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:56.480
Ow!

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:57.960
Who are you?

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.400
Tor, let go of me!

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.560
Best of luck, then.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.080
Hey, don't move.

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:11.440
Ow...

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:14.840
Who's this?

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:17.600
Oh!

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:24.200
It's Mr. Fiancé!

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.480
My fiancé...

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.440
But...

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.920
he's just Mr. Phony Fiancé.

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.160
Damn,

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.600
I thought I got reincarnated

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.680
as the main character,

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.800
but it turns out I'm the villain.

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.280
You watched way too many dramas.

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.640
The main character or the villain?

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:54.800
There was no such thing.

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.360
Come on, go wash up.

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.120
No!

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.280
Why do you care?

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.320
Go take care of your main one.

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.080
If, by that, you mean Yi,

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.200
I don't have feelings for him anymore.

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:16.640
No way!

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:17.680
No way!

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.320
No way! No way!

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:21.440
No way, no way, no way!

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:26.640
I know

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.560
that your mind

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.440
and your heart

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:37.360
only have room for Yi.

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.720
Yi, Yi

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:42.120
Yi, Yi, Yi,

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:43.080
Yi...

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:11.040
Sometimes...

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.120
I really wish you could read minds,

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:17.760
so you'd know what I think.

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:24.920
Did he just kiss me?

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.120
No... No, he didn't.

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:30.240
It was just a touch of the lips.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.840
Kiss me again if you dare.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:42.880
Please tell me

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.680
you don't still have feelings for him.

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:27.880
Can we kiss again?

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.480
Please?

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:31.680
Please, please, please?
