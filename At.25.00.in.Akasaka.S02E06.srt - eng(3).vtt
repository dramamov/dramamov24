WEBVTT

00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.710
I... skipped the final audition today.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.040
I dropped out.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.750
So you chose the movie?

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.130
Since he needs me so much...

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.540
and has such high hopes for me...

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.540
I want to live up to those expectations.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.170
What about your in-house separation?

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.630
Is it over?

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.880
It's over.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.670
The audition results are out.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:19.630
Asami-san?

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.460
I... got the part.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.290
Congratulations.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.710
Shirasaki.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.210
We have to celebrate.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.500
(Rain and Confession)

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.750
Okay.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.790
Good morning.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.330
Asami-san.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.790
You have time for a coffee, don't you?

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.130
I do.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.210
Today's the first day of rehearsals, right?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.580
Break a leg.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.130
Thank you.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.830
I'm a little nervous.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.670
Rain and Confession.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.420
Let's make it the best it can be.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.290
Right.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.500
It's also Asami-san's
first meeting today, isn't it?

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.290
Yeah.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.000
Good luck.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.790
Thanks.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.500
Morning.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.710
Morning.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.960
Morning.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.710
Good morning.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.750
Congratulations on landing the role of Muroga.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.670
Thank you.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.080
I got the part of Mitarai.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.750
I look forward to working with you.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.290
You too.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.330
Best friends, huh?

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.210
Huh?

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.460
Muroga and Mitarai.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:20.790
That's right.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.880
Then from now on, we're best friends.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.290
I won't hold back when we're acting.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.420
Whoa, them's fightin' words.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.960
Let's all just get along, okay?

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.540
Sakuma-san.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.580
Hello, I'm Sakuma. I'll be playing the villain, Fukuyama.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.750
I'll do my best to keep up.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.250
Morning.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.460
I'm Kuroki, playing Mitarai.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.790
It's a pleasure.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.250
Hey, leading man.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.630
Yes.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.460
Glad to see you know it.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.170
I'm glad we get to act together again.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.790
Me too.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.000
It's great to have you here, Sakuma-san.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.130
Just thinking about being in
one of Aoyama-san's productions...

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.460
gives me the jitters.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.920
I heard that Aoyama-san...

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.330
if you don't perform well in rehearsals...

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.170
he'll recast your part.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.630
What?

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.420
Well, about that...

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.540
I think the expert on that is about to arrive.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.290
Good morning, everyone.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.250
See? Speak of the devil.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.290
Sakuma, what was that supposed to mean?

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.580
I'm Fujioka, and I'll be playing Goto.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.580
Fujioka-san is a regular in Director Aoyama's work.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.960
I'm Shirasaki.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.500
It's a pleasure.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.130
Aoyama-san, good morning.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.920
Morning.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.670
Morning.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.880
I look forward to working with all of you.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.580
Looking forward to it.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.540
"At 25:00, in Akasaka" Season 2
(Episode 6)

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.750
Sorry for keeping you all after the meeting.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.040
Not at all.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.420
Um... before we start filming...

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.130
I wanted to have a chat with all of you.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.750
I believe we've assembled the best possible cast for this.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.750
We have Hayama-san in the lead...

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.170
Ishikawa-san as his love interest...

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.000
and Asano-san as his mother.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.170
It's a pleasure to be working with you.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.000
I really can't wait to start filming.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.130
I'm absolutely thrilled.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.290
I'm confident that with all of you...

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.210
we can create a masterpiece.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.130
This film, Last Note...

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.500
not only has an incredible director...

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.290
but also a veteran actress...

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.750
like Asano Kyoko.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.670
If you can hold your own against her
and truly embody this role...

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.580
as an actor...

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.580
you'll definitely reach a whole new level.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.880
Hayama.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.040
You can do this.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.210
This time...

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.000
I don't want to be strictly bound by the script.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.040
Instead, I want to discuss things with all of you...

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.790
and create this piece together.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.790
Discuss?

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.210
Yes.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.670
Of course, the script is important.

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.960
But ultimately, it's just something
I created in my own head.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.130
I want all of you to bring your own experiences...

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.960
your memories, and your emotions...

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.960
and pour them into your roles.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.670
The unique qualities that each of you possess...

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.630
will become the flesh and blood of your characters.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.080
I told you, it's nothing.

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:50.580
Don't lie to me.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.170
We've been together for two years.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.460
I know you.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.710
What do you know about me?

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.290
Ever since that outsider disappeared...

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.710
you haven't been yourself.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.630
Something happened, didn't it?

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.960
I'm telling you, I didn't do anything.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.000
Can't you just believe me?

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.250
Alright, that's a wrap. Thanks, everyone.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.670
Hmm.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.880
Okay, Mitarai, that was good.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.540
Thank you, director.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.250
Tell me something.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.250
For Mitarai to say something like that...

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.500
just how much does he really suspect Muroga?

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.250
Well...

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.380
Personally, I think...

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.630
even though Mitarai comes down hard on Muroga...

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.330
deep down, he actually believes he's innocent.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.920
After all, nobody wants to suspect their own best friend.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:48.710
Good work.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.750
Hayama-san.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.420
May I ask one more question?

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:01.170
Of course.

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:04.630
The main character is estranged from his mother.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.380
When they finally reunite after a long time...

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.210
he learns she has Alzheimer's, correct?

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.500
That's right.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.580
If you, Hayama-san,
also had an estranged parent,

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.000
and you were faced with them
gradually losing their memories,

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.420
what kind of emotions do you think you would feel?

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:22.500
And what would you do?

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.040
That's what I want to know.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.790
For this movie, I'm asking you

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.460
to take all your own emotions, Hayama-san,

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.750
and unleash them on set.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.460
My own...?

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.540
Shirasaki...

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.330
Shirasaki.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.080
It's about time to go.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.670
Okay.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.170
Do you guys have anything after this?

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:53.830
An interview for a TV drama.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.880
The one that Shirasaki and I were in,
Daydream.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.290
Oh...

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.540
That's the drama that made
Shirasaki-san a star, right?

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.000
That's right. It's the special episode.

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:05.710
It's been a while since we all got together.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.290
I'm really looking forward to it.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.630
I see.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.830
You guys are in high demand.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.630
Well, we'll be going then.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:13.920
See you.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.080
- See you.
- Take care, you two.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:17.920
Okay.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:27.040
It's been a little while since you wrapped
the special episode of Daydream.

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:30.500
Has it been a long time since you all saw each other?

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.420
It has.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:34.210
No.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:35.540
- Not really.
- Right.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.830
We see each other pretty often.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.750
Sometimes we run into each other on different sets.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.540
And... we sometimes go out to eat together.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.710
You get together on your own time?

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:44.420
Yes.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.250
That's wonderful news for the fans.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.130
The four of us just went for barbecue the other day.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:51.880
Hey, Yamase.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.250
Can you stop ordering only chicken breast?

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.540
Hey, I can't help it. I'm training.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:57.420
Right?

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.420
Fair enough.

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:02.250
Shirasaki-san, how did you find this shoot?

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.580
It was a lot of fun.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.080
Ah, well...

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.880
being able to become Takumi again after so long...

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.750
and see Ryoji...

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I think this is a series...

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.540
that really changed me.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.330
Speaking of which...

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.130
Hayama-san and Shirasaki-san, in college,

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.500
weren't you a senior and junior in the same club?

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:30.210
Huh?

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.460
Is that true?

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:33.670
I had no idea.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:37.960
Actually, Shirasaki was two years
my junior in the film club.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:39.250
But...

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.380
we hardly ever spoke.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.420
No one ever thought
you'd end up acting together like this.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.710
It's quite a surprise.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:45.880
Yeah.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:49.290
I never imagined I'd get to work with him.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:51.500
It's like a dream come true.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.250
The feeling's mutual.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.710
This is fantastic.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:00.960
I'm looking forward to seeing you all
in the "Daydream" special.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.380
I can't wait.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.670
What are you doing after this?

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:05.960
Want to grab a drink?

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.580
Ah... sorry.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:08.580
Not today.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:09.290
Huh?

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.710
Shirasaki and I have rehearsal tomorrow too.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:13.710
And Hayama, you have to prep for your movie, right?

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.210
Yeah.

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:16.710
It's a shame.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:18.750
But we'll have to take a rain check.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.830
I guess this is what it means to be in demand.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.460
Don't you want to make it big?

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.790
No, I do.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.460
Let's grab a meal again soon.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.290
Well then...

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.170
Shirasaki, see you tomorrow.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:36.040
Okay.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:37.040
Great work, everyone.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:39.500
- Take care.
- I'm definitely gonna make it big.

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.290
You're already a star.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:43.830
Well then...

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.750
Shall we go?

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.420
Okay.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:57.920
Would you like something to drink?

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.250
Oh, I'll get it.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.080
Is tea okay?

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:02.670
Thanks.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.460
I made some tea...

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:47.790
Huh?

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.500
You were awake this whole time?

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:54.170
I can't believe you caught me off guard.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:58.670
What? I wasn't trying to sneak up on you.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.250
Shirasaki.

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.210
You kiss me in my sleep sometimes, don't you?

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.830
Huh? You noticed?

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.130
Well... why didn't you say anything then?

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.030
What are you doing?

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.630
- Wait.
- You're terrible.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:17.960
Hayama-san.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.630
I'm sorry.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.210
You're just so cute.

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:23.170
That tickles...

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.000
Hayama-san, that tickles...

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.330
It's because you're so cute.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:27.830
What did you say?

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.540
I won't. I won't do it again.

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:30.790
No, I'll still do it.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.000
I'm really sorry.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:33.710
Um...

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:39.920
You and Muroga are rivals, right?

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.880
No.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.170
It's not like that.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:48.500
Muroga is always one step ahead of you.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:51.750
So you always saw him as a threat.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:57.580
You're sick of him, but you also envy him.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.460
You even want him dead.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.750
No, I never thought that.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.040
You're not gentle at all.

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:08.250
You're actually a cunning, cold, and despicable person.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.710
That's why...

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:13.210
You killed him and took his place, isn't it?

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.170
You too?

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.000
Are you also here to get in my way?

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.000
If that's the case...

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.380
Lights dim.

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.170
Okay, thank you.

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:27.920
Thank you.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.420
Okay.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:31.130
Hmm...

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:34.250
- Fukuyama.
- Yes?

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:35.330
That was pretty good.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:36.920
Like a snake.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.250
I just feel...

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.460
How should I put this?

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:44.080
Uh...

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:51.080
I want to see more of this man's pathetic side.

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:52.130
Ah...

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.000
I understand.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:54.460
Yeah.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:56.750
Right. But still, it was good.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.960
Muroga.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.290
Yes?

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.500
I couldn't feel that you've killed someone.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:06.540
Huh?

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:10.330
It's true that at this point, Muroga
is hiding his true self.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.960
But that doesn't mean you can play it so plainly.

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:18.880
You.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.960
You've killed a man.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:27.960
Okay, let's go again.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.630
From the top.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:30.790
Yes, sir.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:36.920
Alright, let's take that last scene
again from the top.

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.080
What does "like a snake" even mean...?

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:49.750
The spotlight isn't on me much.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.540
I can't go on like this.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.580
But...

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.330
the look of a killer...

00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.580
How am I supposed to portray that?

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.250
Welcome home.

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:36.130
What's wrong?

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:42.290
Did something happen?

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.630
Was rehearsal tough?

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:54.580
Sorry.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.420
You must be tired too, Asami-san.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.790
Let me take care of you.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.290
Although I do love how you always
try to handle things on your own.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:25.250
I want to stand on equal footing with the person I admire.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.580
But it just doesn't feel like it's going well.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.420
If there's anything you want to eat, just say the word.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.170
Anything you want.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.210
Anything?

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.130
Mhm.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:05.580
Am I on the menu too?

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.420
Don't talk.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.540
I was thinking it'd be fun
if you put it on, Asami-san.

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:21.330
It looks amazing on you, just as I thought.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.830
Thanks.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.790
(Last Note)
Huh?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.210
Were you just reading your script?

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:35.630
Wait.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.380
Um...

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.130
It's okay. You don't have to keep me company.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.250
Is that so?

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.040
I thought this is what you wanted.

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:49.580
No, I mean, I do.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.790
So you do want to.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:53.670
But...

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.830
I don't want to bother you, Asami-san.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.040
I want to be pampered by him.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:06.420
I just want you to hold me, Asami-san.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:09.540
I want you to tell me, "It's going to be okay."

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.920
Are you sure it's okay?

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:17.670
It's fine.

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.790
I kind of... don't like myself today.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.960
I feel like I'm about to hate myself.

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:32.170
That part of you...

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:33.750
I really like it.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:36.170
It's going to be okay.

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:38.710
Don't rush.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:47.920
Stop it...

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:56.540
In the end, I still ended up needing him to comfort me.

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:04.250
Am I really being good company
for Asami-san like this?

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:19.290
If you, Hayama-san,
also had an estranged parent...

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:26.040
(To Asami)

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:44.630
What do you know about me?

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:46.630
Ever since that outsider disappeared,

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:48.830
you haven't seemed right.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.750
Something must have happened, right?

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:55.670
I told you I didn't do anything.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:57.830
Just believe me.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.750
Okay, thank you.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.380
Okay.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:04.380
Shirasaki.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.830
Yes?

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.540
You need to be more aware

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:12.210
of conveying your emotions to the audience.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.790
Yes, uh...

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:16.540
Again.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:18.000
Right.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:20.250
Something must have happened, right?

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.290
I told you I didn't do anything.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.250
Just believe me.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.710
Okay, great work.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:28.040
Right.

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:30.380
Shirasaki.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:31.750
Yes.

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:34.580
You need to listen to your scene partner's lines more.

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.080
- Sorry.
- And react.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:38.000
Let them affect you.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.290
I'm sorry.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:42.540
Again.

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:46.960
Something must have happened, right?

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.040
I told you I didn't do anything.

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:51.250
Just believe me.

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:55.580
Okay, great work.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.130
Right.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:02.170
Hmm...

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:06.420
Kuroki.

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:07.290
Yes?

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.500
Can you try playing Muroga for a bit?

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:11.750
Huh?

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.500
Oh, okay.

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:15.630
Shirasaki, just watch from the side for now.

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:16.330
Fujioka.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.250
Yes?

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.670
You play Mitarai.

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:19.330
Got it.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:20.210
Sorry about this.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:21.500
Not at all.

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.710
Do you have Muroga's lines memorized?

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:32.040
- I do.
- You do?

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:36.130
Alright, let's take it from the top.

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:39.710
Are you ready?

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:41.080
Ready.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:43.080
Okay then.

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:44.960
Action.

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:46.710
Ugh...

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:52.580
I told you, it's nothing.

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.170
Don't lie to me.

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:56.250
We've been together for two years.

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:57.960
I know you.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:03.960
What do you know about me?

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:06.330
Ever since that outsider disappeared,

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.540
you haven't been yourself.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:10.920
Something must have happened, right?

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:20.420
No, it's nothing.

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:23.170
Just trust me, okay?

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.380
Okay.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.080
Thank you, both.

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:35.250
Kuroki, your take on Muroga is very interesting.

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.630
Thank you.

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:44.210
(This is a work of fiction.)

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:46.140
(Next Episode)
Mom...

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:47.500
You haven't been coming home.

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:48.630
I've been worried about you.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:50.080
You can come back now.

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:52.790
I gave it my all, but things just aren't working out.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.040
I love Shirasaki's acting.

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:56.500
Please give me some advice.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:59.750
The one who takes me
the most seriously... is Kuroki.
