00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.760
- (Previously on "Player")
- Ever since I found out about Ploy Pitcha,

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.920
I figured you were talking to her
to dig up something about Phe.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.120
How did you even know
that my birthday’s coming up?

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.240
It’s because I pay attention.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.080
I also want to know
about your first kiss.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.400
11th grade, in a science classroom.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.240
My TV channel is having
a sports day event next week.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.160
Want some tickets?

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.400
Will you marry me, Prang?

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.040
Don’t think just because you’ve dated
the producer, you can do whatever you like.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.840
- Ploy!
- Ploy!

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.480
Did you see the girl
who got in the ambulance with Ploy?

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.440
I think her name’s Dream.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.800
She’s the daughter of the producer.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.400
Probably around the same age as Ploy, too.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.800
If you’d gotten that out of her,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.520
we’d have found him ages ago.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.760
I just hope you’re happy
with your Ploy Pitcha.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.640
“So, the new player”

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.920
“has arrived.”

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.000
Here you go.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.240
Your name’s Ploy, right?

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.720
I’m Dream.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.480
I brought this for you.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.720
You did really well today.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.840
Thanks.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.600
Want me to open it for you?

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.320
(sighs) I’m so tired.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.680
You smell so good, Ploy.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.440
Are you wearing perfume?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.720
Hey!

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.600
I put some on too.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.720
Smells nice, right?

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.560
Mhm.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.000
(sighs)

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.360
But it still doesn’t smell as good as you.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.079
Is this right?

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.600
Then you’re taken by me.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.320
Are you done with your stuff?

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.320
“Not yet, Ploy. I’ll catch up with you.”

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:17.519
“Be right there.”

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.160
Okay.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.159
Oh, Ploy…

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.400
How did you end up here?

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.640
♫ You act so calm and cool
as you’re stepping close to me ♫

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.320
♫ You come around so endlessly,
I know what’s on your mind, you see ♫

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.840
♫ You play it off each time our eyes collide ♫

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.720
♫ But your gaze betrays the truth you try to hide ♫

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.040
♫ The closer we become ♫

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.200
♫ The more my heart’s undone ♫

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.200
♫ It trembles more each time we meet as one ♫

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.800
♫ Game for your love ♫

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.480
♫ But I’m a pro player, baby ♫

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.600
♫ I wish you’d slip and show your heart to me ♫

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.920
♫ But somehow, I can always see it clearly ♫

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:08.200
♫ I try so hard to hold my heart inside
But in the end, I can’t stop loving you so right ♫

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.680
♫ Game Over ♫

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.440
This girl...

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.160
Is she your friend, Ploy?

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.680
Okay, let’s get you sitting down

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.920
Easy now.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.080
So,

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.080
is she your friend, then?

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.720
Pun.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.840
This is Dream, my friend.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.320
Dream.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.640
This is Pun, Prang’s younger sister.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.880
Hi,

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.320
Dream.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.320
Hi.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.760
Prang’s sister? Prang Pannapat, right?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.480
Ever thought about acting?

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.160
You’ve got such a pretty face.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.960
I could help you get started.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.640
No, thank you.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:38.880
Mhm?

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.520
Yeah.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.320
Prang and Jay

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:44.720
will drop by later tonight.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.200
Would you like some water?

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.840
This one’s Ploy’s favorite.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:05.920
Thanks.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.400
Ji told you, didn’t she

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.640
that I’m staying to watch over you tonight?

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.320
Then,

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.640
let me help you with your bath.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:24.680
Okay?

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.440
You do know the reason

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.000
why I end up here, don’t you?

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:35.520
Ploy,

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.440
let me handle this.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.840
I can sort it out at the root.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:42.280
Don’t drag me into this.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.960
Can you even deal with your own people, Dream?

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.920
I just want to work.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.120
Please, Ploy.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.440
Dream, you should head home.
I’m really worn out.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.360
And I’ve already got someone looking after me.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:07.560
Ploy...

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.960
Don’t be so cold, please.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.480
Just give me one week.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.560
I’ll prove it to you. I promise.
Please.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.480
Go home, Dream.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.600
Okay.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.200
I’ll get going, then.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.160
Take care of yourself, yeah?

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.120
See you later.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.400
Okay.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.240
Are you angry with me?

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.800
Do I have the right to be?

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.280
Hey.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.200
Come a bit closer.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.840
No.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.680
Your leg, Ploy...

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.560
Doesn’t it hurt?

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:36.880
It does.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.920
And why did you let her hold you just now?

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.280
Ugh.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.080
Could you stay still for a bit?

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.040
Let go of me.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.080
I feel better standing like this

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.160
than lying on the bed.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.680
But I still don’t get it

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.320
about your leg.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.840
Do you know what showbiz is like, Pun?

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.360
You’re such a cheeky one.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.200
Where did she kiss you just now?

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.600
Come here.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:18.760
Mm.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.800
Mhm.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.440
Ugh.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.600
Can’t reach… Sit still.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.240
Don’t move.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.440
Muah, muah, muah.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.520
No one else is allowed to kiss you again.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.720
“What kind of person…”

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.080
“looks that beautiful even when she’s asleep?”

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.920
The company in New York?

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.280
Hello.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.080
Miss Punnakorn.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.240
We are interested…

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.200
Damn!

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.320
I’ve packed everything.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.240
Let’s go home.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.440
I don’t feel like going home yet.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.200
Looks like I’m still not fully recovered.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.000
You look better now.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.440
The doctor even said you could go home.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.560
Really?

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.720
I think...

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.680
I might need another check-up.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.040
In that case,

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.000
I’ll do the check-up myself.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.360
But you still have to go home today.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.720
I can’t look after you all day.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.120
I’m afraid some devil might show up
and make me sin again.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.280
Okay.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.600
Alright. Let’s go.
Can you stand up?

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.520
- Could you carry me?
- (laughs)

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.920
Prang, have you heard the news?

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.520
What news?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.240
Annie’s been dropped from the show.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.200
- Huh?
- Seriously, Jay?

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.720
Yeah, they’re saying Annie

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.200
hurt Ploy on purpose.
The higher-ups are furious.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.680
And then what happened?

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.120
The one who got the role instead of Annie

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.600
was me!

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.320
(sighs)

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.400
Congrats, Jay.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.160
What for, Ploy?

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.640
It’s Jae Ang who’s happy, not me.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:24.520
She never consults me before taking any job.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:26.840
(sighs)

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:29.840
Ahem.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.400
Um, everyone.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.200
Prang and I

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.000
have a shoot coming up in Pattaya.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.840
We’d like to invite everyone to join.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.400
Anyone up for it?

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.400
When is it?

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.680
This Saturday.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.040
Hmm.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.760
Oh, I’m free then.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.520
Pun, would you like to come too?

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.640
Sure.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.520
But can I bring a friend along?

00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:59.600
Of course.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.880
🎵 You’re my Love Game
Only you can make me feel the same 🎵

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.960
Will you marry me?

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.440
🎵 Don’t you know my heart’s gone wild inside? 🎵

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.160
I will.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.640
🎵 All I want is you here by my side 🎵

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.480
- 🎵 Forever, is that fine? 🎵
- The ring is on!

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.360
🎵 Cuz you’re my Love Game 🎵

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.120
🎵 Cuz you’re my Love Game 🎵

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.400
🎵 Cuz you’re my Love Game 🎵

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.160
Jay.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.240
Jay.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.680
Jay!

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.120
(laughs)

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.040
What’s up with you? Smiling to yourself like that.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.720
With a grin like that,
you must be thinking something naughty.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.760
No way, Ploy.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.320
I was just thinking about something nice.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.880
- Really?
- Aha!

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.480
Don't lie to me.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.120
Everyone, eat up.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.040
- You were thinking something naughty, weren’t you?
- (laughs)

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.760
Not at all.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:25.600
Okay, okay.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.760
What made you so sleepy?

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.440
Where have you been, Ploy?

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.040
Just got off the jet ski.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.480
You were still asleep.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.200
So...

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.640
Did you put sunscreen on yet?

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.200
Uh-huh.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.240
You look so gorgeous, Ploy.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.560
I’m getting jealous.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.600
But I’d never ask you to be any less beautiful.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.080
You talk too much.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.120
Anyway, they’ve docked at the island,
so I came to wake you

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.280
in case you wanted to join them.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.000
Hmm.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.040
Let the others go down first.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.880
That way, we can have the yacht
all to ourselves.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.480
🎵 Tuh-tuh-tuhhh 🎵

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.800
🎵 Tuh-duh-duh-duh-duhh-duh-duhh 🎵

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.600
I’m the king of the world!

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.880
Why do I have to be Jack?

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:16.400
Because I’m the gorgeous long-haired one,
so obviously I’m Rose.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.760
Fine, I’ll be Jack in this scene.
You can be Jack in the next one.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.600
- Which scene?
- The one where they’re floating in the sea.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.200
You can float there and die.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.480
Watch your mouth!

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.200
Hey, stop it, you two.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.440
You’re ruining the vibe.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.440
And don’t forget to thank Goy
for letting us come aboard.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.880
- Thank you.
- That’s fine.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.120
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.360
A little something to repay the yacht fee.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.520
So, Ploy, are you Jack or Rose?

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.640
Neither. Thanks. I’m afraid it might be bad luck.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.960
Hello, I’m Prang.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.480
Hi, I’m Jay.

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.760
We’re here today
at Underwater World.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.360
We’re about to watch a very special show.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.000
Let’s check it out!

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:19.880
Cut!

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.600
Thank you.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.880
Mmm, that was beautiful.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.680
Okay, let’s take a short break.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.720
Next, we’ll be watching the fish show.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:36.120
I’ll just need about half an hour.
See you then.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.880
Dream’s producing this project too?
I didn’t know that.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.200
Well, seeing all this, I’d say yes.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.840
She’s heading this way, Prang.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:45.960
Prang.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.800
Don’t act suspicious, Jay.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.800
She’s coming right up to us, Prang.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:52.560
Hello.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.000
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:57.320
Tired?

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.800
Oh, not at all.
Everyone’s been taking great care of us.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.560
That’s good to hear. Get some rest,
you’ve got half an hour.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.040
Okay.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:10.800
Oh, by the way,

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.400
I heard that after the shoot,

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.840
you both we’ll go on a trip, right?

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.840
Uh… oh, yeah.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:21.960
That’s right.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.040
Have fun, then.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.360
Oh, thank you.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.360
Why’d you tell her that?

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.960
How was I supposed to know?

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.760
I nudged you.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.720
I thought you wanted me to say it.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.720
Not to say it!

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.240
I don’t know.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.480
Oh my god.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:45.600
I’m sorry.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.520
Jay.

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.400
“Honey, what’s wrong?”

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.280
Jay, are you alright?

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.240
“Hey, are you okay?”

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.560
Oh, my heart hurts.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.240
- (”Marry me?”)
- Will you marry me?

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.640
What’s wrong?

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.400
Aren’t you happy for them?

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.040
I was just thinking.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:30.600
Thinking what?

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.120
Thinking the gods must really hate me.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:35.880
Huh?

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.800
But honestly,

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.480
if it were me,

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.480
I wouldn’t be thrilled about
a proposal like that.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.160
Why not?

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.200
Well…

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.600
Making everyone worry like that?
That’s not right.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.920
And proposing in an aquarium, of all places?

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.520
What, did he want the fish
to be witnesses to their love?

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.160
Jae Ang!

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.320
Can I just say I’m sorry?

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.920
I really am, Jae Ang.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.960
Go apologize to the crew.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.240
Everyone’s exhausted.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.640
And in the end, it still fell apart anyway.

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.800
Alright, fine, fine.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:36.760
You’re forgiven.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.960
I really am sorry.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.000
Guys, I’m really sorry too.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.720
Sorry, everyone.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.080
Go go go.

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.280
- Yeah.
- Let’s go.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:00.560
Um…

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.200
- This way.
- Exit’s over here.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.320
Come on, Prang.

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.280
♫ You act so calm and cool
as you’re stepping close to me ♫

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.960
♫ You come around so endlessly,
I know what’s on your mind, you see ♫

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.480
♫ You play it off each time our eyes collide ♫

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.360
♫ But your gaze betrays the truth you try to hide ♫

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.760
Taking photos of people without permission is illegal.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.680
Punishable by up to a year in prison,
a fine of three million baht,

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.520
or both.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.200
What if it’s both arresting and caressing?

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.520
Are you always this cheeky?

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.120
Cheeky? Not at all.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.120
I was just playing with words.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.480
See? Words can be fun
if you use them right.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.440
You’re the one who’s too much fun

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.760
and too much trouble.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.880
And cute, don’t you think?

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.320
I’m not telling.

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.800
That’s your punishment for taking my picture.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.040
A punishment that’s

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.240
soft,

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.160
sweet,

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.960
and smells lovely.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.680
With one like that,
I wouldn’t mind being punished more often.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.120
Ploy.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.120
Since we’re already here.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.080
How about we...

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.840
do something a bit thrilling?

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:03.960
Hey, everyone!

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.360
How’s it going? Getting tired yet?

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.120
How about we chill by the pool tonight?

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.120
Sure!

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:10.840
Just give me a sec.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.520
A good meal will sort you out.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:13.760
I’m knackered.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.240
Huh?

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.400
That car, isn’t that…

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.880
Hi, Ploy!

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.080
“Seriously?”

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.160
“Dream!”

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.320
“Here?”

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.520
“Now?”

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.160
(sighs)

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.400
Hello.

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.480
Are you here with your friends, Ploy?

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.120
What a coincidence!

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:40.920
Oh, Ploy...

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.280
“Ugh, that two-faced snake.”

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.000
“This is getting ridiculous.”

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.840
You never told me you were staying here.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.280
I’m staying here too.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:56.480
Ahem.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:57.880
I think

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.320
everyone’s probably tired from work.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.320
Why don’t we all go unpack and rest for a bit?

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.640
Good idea.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.720
In that case, Ploy...

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.800
take me to your room, will you?

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.560
“Oh, she’s shameless.”

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.000
“Try acting like a lady for once.”

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:19.360
Let’s go.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:21.280
Ahem.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.040
Ploy.

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:27.440
I remember you left something
on the yacht, didn’t you?

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.080
Maybe you should go and get it.

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.120
Alright.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.800
Mind if you come with me?

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.120
Sure.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.080
Ploy.

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:49.920
Let’s go.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.400
Ploy.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.600
Um, let’s head inside.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.800
- Yeah, come on.
- Let’s go in.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:00.560
I’m starving.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.920
- So hungry.
- Let’s go.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.240
Uno game!

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.720
We’re down to the last two players.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:18.720
Funny, isn’t it?

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.040
Back in the day, I used to beat Ploy every time.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.400
But now Ploy’s the one winning.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.360
She was really popular back then.

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.800
A drum major. Loads of admirers.

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.800
Oh, we were just close around that time.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.040
So,

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.400
how’s your series going, Dream?

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.040
Pretty good. Making decent money.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.160
Really?

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.600
I heard it’s about to flop.

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:03.360
Oh, I’m so sorry.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.160
I must’ve heard it from the news or something.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.240
Prang usually doesn’t talk much, does she?

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.680
But why are you so chatty?

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.040
I’d say...

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.440
you talk more than I do.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.640
Talk too much, really.

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.800
I was just reminiscing, that’s all.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.360
Uno.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.080
Your turn?

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.120
Uno.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.040
What color?

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.280
Yellow.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.600
Uno game!

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.120
Right.

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:38.960
Congratulations.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.480
I’ll go to the restroom.

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:44.600
Be right back.

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.600
Excuse me for a moment.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.520
- Prang.
- Hm?

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.160
Do people in showbiz often date secretly?

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:00.800
Mhm.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:02.880
Ask Jay.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.920
She’s been around the whole industry.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.200
(coughs)

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.960
Prang, what are you saying?

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.360
I’ve never been involved with anyone.

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.440
Oh, everyone in the industry knows.

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:19.840
Oh, come on. You just believe gossip.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.360
You never ask me.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:25.000
Everyone around me is just jealous.

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:27.560
And...

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.480
what about Kimmy

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.000
from Channel One?

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.240
That was the past. We broke up ages ago.

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.800
But now I’m completely clean.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.080
Not even rumors

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.360
can stain me.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:45.960
Didn’t you say

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.960
you couldn’t move on after that breakup?

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.680
Yet you managed to sleep your way
through half the industry?

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.400
I was really heartbroken back then.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.040
I lost my way.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:01.080
But now, I only love you, Prang.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.240
Get back to the game!

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.080
Yeah!

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.320
Ploy.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.280
You’re still waiting for me, aren’t you?
That’s why you’re still single.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.000
You just believe what you want to believe.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.320
Ploy, don’t deny it.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.080
Why make things harder than they are?

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.640
I already cleared things up with Annie.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:34.880
She’s not bothering us anymore.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.480
When I told you to sort it out at the root,

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.560
I meant stop getting involved with me,

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.360
not to dump Annie.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.320
Anyway, I don’t want to talk about this anymore.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:54.160
You like that girl, Pun, don’t you?

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:08.719
Hello!

00:34:09.239 --> 00:34:11.400
Pun, this is me Catherine.

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:14.040
Oh. Hi. Catherine.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.040
Is everything okay?

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.199
Yeah, everything’s fine.

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:20.960
I just wanted to ask you about the company.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.600
You’ve already got the email, right?

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.840
Yeah, I’ve got it.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.199
Was that you?

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.440
No, Pun.

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.679
I was just proposing you to Sam

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.920
and they looked so interested.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.800
I think you should try again this time.

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.560
We’ll help you with the visa, don’t worry.

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.719
I promise I will think about it.

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:44.440
But I really have to go right now.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.320
Call you back later. Bye.

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.040
“You like that girl, Pun, don’t you?”

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:01.840
“Answer me.”

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.080
Ploy...

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.000
Let’s get back together.

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:21.320
Dream...

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:23.520
Ugh!

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.040
(screams)

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:29.920
Ow!

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:31.520
Ouch!

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.560
What the heck is this?

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.000
(screams)

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.040
Ploy!

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.200
Ploy, help!

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.160
Give that to me!

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:02.320
What the hell’s wrong with you?

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.040
- Grr!
- (screams)

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.320
My nose!

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.880
Do you know how much that costs to fix?

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:21.520
Ploy?

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:49.880
Yeah?

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:52.360
Ploy.

00:36:58.480 --> 00:36:59.520
What is it, Pun?

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.120
(screams)

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.720
(screams)

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:22.480
(sighs)

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.200
Jieab!

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.800
It’s just a dream.

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.240
Why are you out swimming this late, Ploy?

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.600
And why are you out walking this late, Pun?

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.000
Ploy...

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.040
Have you ever felt jealous

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.920
when I talk to someone else?

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.560
And who’ve you been talking to, then?

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.280
I get jealous when you’re with Dream.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.520
Sorry for being silly.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.240
But I just hate it

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.680
when you’re around her.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.720
Want to swim with me?

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.360
Not in the mood?

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:37.680
Not really.

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:46.120
Oh!

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:53.480
Ploy.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.600
What did you ask me just now?

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:13.000
I asked if you’ve ever been jealous.

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.920
Have you?

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:53.760
Maybe just once?

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.520
You belong only to me, Pun.

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:46.240
Hello?

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.640
Pun. You’ve made up your mind, right?

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:49.000
Sorry,

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:50.920
I’ve decided

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:53.920
I’m not going back this time.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.240
- (Next episode)
- I’m starting to think

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:05.240
there’s definitely something going on
between Pun and Ploy.

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:06.920
We just ran into Phetai.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.120
Is something wrong?

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:09.280
It’s just...

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.760
I don’t like seeing someone else’s mark
on your neck.

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.200
And when you talk to other people,

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:15.760
do you ever care about how I feel?

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:19.440
You haven’t come to see me at all.
Is it because you’re angry with me?

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.040
