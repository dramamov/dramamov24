Ms. Man Li.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.240
Why are you back so late again?

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.680
What are you looking at?

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.720
Isn't this Ms. Rose of Night Shanghai?

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.200
Thanks for your hard work.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.200
I am giving this to you, just take it.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.360
Why so much talk?

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.240
That's embarrassing.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.760
Is this your friend?

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.640
Talks too much.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.120
Ms. Man Li, come out soon.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.180
Don't make it hard for me.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.440
Take it.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.120
I'll wait for you here.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.280
You go in first.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.880
Okay.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.000
Why are you here?

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.480
Who?

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.320
Who brought you here?

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.680
Musheng.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.800
What happened to you?

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.880
It's fine.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.360
I'm tough.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.120
I won't die.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.640
You've lost weight.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.840
No, I haven't.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.640
I still eat and sleep well.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.320
Still being stubborn.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.320
Don't try to get me out.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.160
I'll be out soon.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.080
Trust me.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.040
Musheng.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.280
Come back safely.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.880
Otherwise,

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.840
I won't forgive you.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.360
Promise me.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.280
Rose.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.680
Time to go.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.520
I miss you.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.280
I'll wait for you to come back.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.440
Don't cry.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.600
Let's go first.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.440
- Boss.
- Boss.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.400
That cut on Captain Luo's arm
is really strange.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.120
Hey, you think,

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.200
if it were a normal sneak attack,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.160
then it's possible.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.680
Ah forget it.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.840
We're just chatting.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.920
No other meaning.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.480
Boss.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.760
Here, give it to me.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.960
Boss.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.320
What Zhou Musheng said

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.120
are reasonable.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.560
I don't think Zhou Musheng
would betray you.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.520
After all, he took a bullet for you.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.920
Boss.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.760
Think about it.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.080
Really think about it.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.640
Release Zhou Musheng.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.400
Find a few tight-lipped men.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.960
Bring Luo Zhenyao back first.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.000
Keep it quiet.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.800
Boss.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.920
You mean...

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.960
Handle it secretly.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.800
Don't make it public.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.480
I don't want outsiders

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.840
to see the North City Chamber
of Commerce's joke.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.840
Understood.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.200
I'll handle it now.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.080
Oh wow.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.000
Yao, you're living large now.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.520
So comfortable.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.480
Drinking wine.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.040
Whoa.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.560
Nice!

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.400
What wine are you drinking?

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.640
Why are you here, Liu?

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.200
Come on.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.080
What's the meaning of this?

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.920
Yao.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.800
Don't make it hard on the brothers.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.760
We're just

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.640
following orders.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:50.840
Take him away.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.120
Du Hongyue.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.840
You rascal!

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.680
Musheng.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.400
Go back and see a doctor.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.580
Get checked properly, quickly.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.880
Thanks, Liu.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.000
Just wait, I'll get you.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.480
(This beating wasn't in vain.)
