(Tell me why.)

00:04:20.874 --> 00:04:21.795
I can't remember.

00:04:24.754 --> 00:04:25.675
What did you say?

00:04:28.915 --> 00:04:29.434
Nothing.

00:04:32.954 --> 00:04:33.634

00:05:09.754 --> 00:05:10.834

00:05:15.434 --> 00:05:15.874
Thank you.

00:05:20.035 --> 00:05:21.235
That beggar

00:05:21.235 --> 00:05:22.394
acted suspiciously.

00:05:22.795 --> 00:05:23.995
He reminded me of Gu Qianfu.

00:05:25.194 --> 00:05:26.874
Even that wacky vibe matches.

00:05:27.555 --> 00:05:29.514
Perhaps that was him indeed.

00:05:30.834 --> 00:05:31.595
Spare some change?

00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:34.074
Spare some change?

00:05:35.795 --> 00:05:36.795
Spare some change?

00:05:39.355 --> 00:05:40.235
Spare some change?

00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:42.995
Spare some change?

00:05:45.475 --> 00:05:47.115
I knew he wouldn't die easily.

00:05:48.634 --> 00:05:50.434
How do you know his mannerisms so well?

00:05:50.754 --> 00:05:51.715
I'm an agent.

00:05:52.555 --> 00:05:54.355
I'm good at memorizing people's

00:05:54.715 --> 00:05:55.355
features.

00:05:57.235 --> 00:05:57.795
Makes sense.

00:06:00.555 --> 00:06:01.235
Let me test him.

00:06:06.274 --> 00:06:07.874
Spare some change?

00:06:08.675 --> 00:06:10.314
Spare some change?

00:06:11.475 --> 00:06:11.954
Hey you.

00:06:12.595 --> 00:06:13.394
Are you Gu Qianfu?

00:06:14.314 --> 00:06:15.155
I'm Xue Hexu.

00:06:15.514 --> 00:06:16.194
Remember me?

00:06:20.035 --> 00:06:21.314
Y-You're mistaken.

00:06:22.314 --> 00:06:23.995
I'm not Gu Qianfu.

00:06:27.394 --> 00:06:29.355
If you are in trouble,

00:06:29.795 --> 00:06:30.834
feel free to tell me.

00:06:31.274 --> 00:06:33.475
Here. Have a pancake.

00:06:58.675 --> 00:07:00.155
I haven't eaten in three days!

00:07:13.074 --> 00:07:13.634
Fine, it's me.

00:07:14.115 --> 00:07:14.954
I am Gu Qianfu.

00:07:15.394 --> 00:07:16.434
No way.

00:07:16.954 --> 00:07:18.235
Mr. Gu wouldn't have been

00:07:18.434 --> 00:07:19.715
robbed by beggars.

00:07:20.715 --> 00:07:22.035
And you just denied it.

00:07:22.754 --> 00:07:23.434
W-Wait.

00:07:24.155 --> 00:07:25.754
I-I swear I am Gu Qianfu.

00:07:26.274 --> 00:07:27.834
Admitting it in public

00:07:27.915 --> 00:07:29.035
makes this even less

00:07:29.555 --> 00:07:30.314
convincing.

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:35.394
Come on.

00:07:35.555 --> 00:07:36.074
I-I...

00:07:36.194 --> 00:07:37.634
I swear I'm Gu Qianfu.

00:07:37.754 --> 00:07:38.795
Why won't you believe me?

00:07:38.954 --> 00:07:40.634
Listen... I undressed
your sister publicly.

00:07:41.194 --> 00:07:41.995
You make me sick.

00:07:42.514 --> 00:07:43.634
Why waste words?

00:07:45.995 --> 00:07:46.834
Stop teasing him.

00:07:47.434 --> 00:07:49.834
He opposed you and drugged you before.

00:07:51.434 --> 00:07:52.155
Childish.

00:07:55.394 --> 00:07:57.035
Acknowledge my presence!

00:07:57.475 --> 00:07:59.115
Am I part of your play?

00:08:00.194 --> 00:08:02.035
Why don't we live together as three?

00:08:02.555 --> 00:08:02.915
Stop.

00:08:04.634 --> 00:08:05.155
Spare me.

00:08:06.754 --> 00:08:07.155
Spare me.

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:09.274
Spare me.

00:08:18.754 --> 00:08:19.434
Gu Qianfu.

00:08:20.634 --> 00:08:21.715
What exactly happened?

00:08:26.874 --> 00:08:27.795
I tried hard to bring

00:08:27.915 --> 00:08:29.074
the former Crown Prince back

00:08:29.194 --> 00:08:30.394
under that monster's nose.

00:08:30.514 --> 00:08:31.355
To distract her,

00:08:31.555 --> 00:08:32.235
I even gave up

00:08:32.394 --> 00:08:33.955
the two pearls my mother left me.

00:08:34.235 --> 00:08:35.195
After all this effort,

00:08:35.394 --> 00:08:36.835
they still dock my salary

00:08:37.034 --> 00:08:38.315
for a lack of full attendance?

00:08:38.475 --> 00:08:39.794
I was hunting criminals

00:08:39.995 --> 00:08:40.914
out there.

00:08:57.595 --> 00:08:58.715
Why is he so sneaky?

00:09:24.554 --> 00:09:25.355
This will make up

00:09:26.315 --> 00:09:27.554
for my lost wages.

00:09:43.835 --> 00:09:45.394
(A secret passage in Jing'an Bureau?)

00:10:08.674 --> 00:10:09.514
Utterly foolish.

00:10:10.115 --> 00:10:11.634
How could you involve Gu Qianfu?

00:10:14.235 --> 00:10:16.435
I wanted to keep
Jing'an Bureau out of this,

00:10:17.315 --> 00:10:19.554
so I hired external assassins
at great cost.

00:10:20.154 --> 00:10:21.914
Yet you kept outsourcing the job

00:10:22.115 --> 00:10:23.595
until it reached Gu Qianfu.

00:10:24.154 --> 00:10:25.554
Anyone with half a brain

00:10:26.715 --> 00:10:27.554
could deduce

00:10:28.315 --> 00:10:29.835
who commissioned the hit.

00:10:30.835 --> 00:10:33.394
He might even uncover the hidden scheme.

00:10:34.715 --> 00:10:36.554
(Grand Tutor wanted Xue Hexu dead?)

00:10:38.674 --> 00:10:40.955
(He's after the former Crown Prince.)

00:10:41.274 --> 00:10:42.634
(Why targeted Xue Hexu?)

00:10:44.195 --> 00:10:45.075
(Unless...)

00:10:47.315 --> 00:10:48.634
(Unless Xue Hexu)

00:10:48.835 --> 00:10:51.394
(was having an affair
with the Grand Tutor's concubine?)

00:11:01.955 --> 00:11:02.955
(This rhythmic pattern)

00:11:03.475 --> 00:11:05.075
(resembles a secret code.)

00:11:09.034 --> 00:11:09.595
Secret code?

00:11:09.995 --> 00:11:10.955
There's no code.

00:11:11.754 --> 00:11:12.475
That's right.

00:11:13.754 --> 00:11:16.154
The code is "There's no code".

00:12:15.394 --> 00:12:16.595
We're basically colleagues.

00:12:17.115 --> 00:12:18.595
Do you have to

00:12:19.115 --> 00:12:20.914
be so brutal to kill me?

00:12:21.914 --> 00:12:23.715
Two people on this job?

00:12:24.235 --> 00:12:25.154
Who's more brutal?

00:12:25.435 --> 00:12:26.715
Look how you beat us.

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:28.394
If you really think of us

00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:29.274
as your colleagues,

00:12:29.435 --> 00:12:30.634
you shouldn't resist so much.

00:12:31.394 --> 00:12:32.754
Why give us a hard time?

00:12:33.195 --> 00:12:33.794
Besides,

00:12:34.195 --> 00:12:35.754
fight the one who wanted you dead.

00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:37.355
Kill him.

00:12:42.874 --> 00:12:43.715
Aim at him.

00:12:44.435 --> 00:12:45.514
Why did you target me?

00:12:45.874 --> 00:12:46.955
My fault.

00:12:47.874 --> 00:12:48.754
You dare dodge?

00:12:49.115 --> 00:12:49.595
Take this.

00:12:53.595 --> 00:12:54.195
Take him down.

00:13:06.355 --> 00:13:08.115
He's a fighter. Any last words?

00:13:08.235 --> 00:13:08.634
Come on.

00:13:08.674 --> 00:13:09.475
Spit it out now.

00:13:09.715 --> 00:13:10.514
No last words,

00:13:11.394 --> 00:13:12.315
just a question.

00:13:13.634 --> 00:13:15.835
How do you split the payment

00:13:16.674 --> 00:13:18.034
for a shared mission?

00:13:18.475 --> 00:13:19.435
Fifty-fifty, of course.

00:13:19.514 --> 00:13:21.274
Wrong.

00:13:21.955 --> 00:13:22.955
I'd say

00:13:23.754 --> 00:13:25.315
based on your skills,

00:13:26.315 --> 00:13:28.475
a 30-70 split makes sense.

00:13:28.754 --> 00:13:29.715
Stop sowing discord

00:13:29.914 --> 00:13:30.674
here.

00:13:31.154 --> 00:13:33.115
We're at best at a ratio of 60:40.

00:13:33.315 --> 00:13:34.154
Yeah, obviously...

00:13:35.874 --> 00:13:37.274
Why should I get 40 percent?

00:13:37.554 --> 00:13:38.874
Oh, you want 60 percent?

00:13:39.274 --> 00:13:40.315
This is ridiculous.

00:13:40.315 --> 00:13:41.115
- What?
- You get 60 percent?

00:13:41.115 --> 00:13:42.195
I make more money.

00:13:42.195 --> 00:13:42.955
Know your place.

00:13:42.955 --> 00:13:43.674
That's enough.

00:13:43.794 --> 00:13:44.315
Come on.

00:13:44.995 --> 00:13:45.595
You...

00:13:48.394 --> 00:13:49.034
Stop it.

00:13:49.355 --> 00:13:50.115
He got away.

00:13:50.235 --> 00:13:50.754
Where is he?

00:13:51.154 --> 00:13:51.595
Get him.

00:13:52.274 --> 00:13:52.634
Get him.

00:14:00.075 --> 00:14:00.715
Where'd he go?

00:14:02.034 --> 00:14:02.554
Pig.

00:14:02.955 --> 00:14:03.514
What...

00:14:03.634 --> 00:14:04.195
Be polite.

00:14:04.274 --> 00:14:05.115
It's not an insult.

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:07.394
Let's find a pig and get some blood

00:14:07.754 --> 00:14:08.914
to be done with it.

00:14:09.274 --> 00:14:10.794
It's too little pay to chase him.

00:14:13.315 --> 00:14:13.754
Let's go.

00:14:15.235 --> 00:14:15.674
This way.

00:14:16.274 --> 00:14:17.195
Y-You...

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:18.955
Wait for me.

00:14:33.435 --> 00:14:34.355
I've vowed

00:14:35.274 --> 00:14:37.995
to dedicate myself to the Jing'an Bureau

00:14:38.955 --> 00:14:40.274
until my last breath.

00:14:41.955 --> 00:14:42.674
But

00:14:43.995 --> 00:14:45.874
look what happened to me.

00:14:48.195 --> 00:14:49.154
They abandoned me.

00:14:50.435 --> 00:14:51.355
Fine.

00:14:55.955 --> 00:14:58.835
But why did they withhold my pension?

00:15:02.154 --> 00:15:03.115
This is absolutely

00:15:03.955 --> 00:15:05.075
unbearable.

00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:14.475
My 3000 liang pension.

00:15:17.674 --> 00:15:21.154
My 3000 liang pension.

00:15:21.154 --> 00:15:22.475
We can't let him keep howling.

00:15:22.874 --> 00:15:23.874
Let's take him away.

00:15:32.394 --> 00:15:36.554
My 3000 liang pension.

00:15:36.754 --> 00:15:38.715
My 3000 liang.

00:15:46.355 --> 00:15:47.595
My 3000 liang

00:15:48.794 --> 00:15:49.955
pension.

00:15:53.754 --> 00:15:54.674
Now I know why

00:15:54.995 --> 00:15:56.315
Grand Tutor Zhou wanted him dead.

00:15:56.435 --> 00:15:58.835
- My 3000 liang pension.
- Me too.

00:16:02.355 --> 00:16:03.995
Aren't you two the main protagonists?

00:16:04.595 --> 00:16:06.235
Can't you show some proper

00:16:06.394 --> 00:16:07.914
protagonist-worthy virtues?

00:16:08.355 --> 00:16:09.274
I'm a wreck.

00:16:10.235 --> 00:16:12.235
Considering our years of rivalry,

00:16:12.634 --> 00:16:13.634
I'll look after you.

00:16:14.315 --> 00:16:17.355
Since you've scrubbed my back before,
I'll look after you.

00:16:20.595 --> 00:16:21.514
Back-scrubbing

00:16:22.754 --> 00:16:23.754
partners forever.

00:16:26.794 --> 00:16:28.075
Jing'an Bureau tried to kill you

00:16:28.235 --> 00:16:29.274
and will try again.

00:16:30.674 --> 00:16:31.115
Listen.

00:16:31.715 --> 00:16:32.514
Our Xue family

00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:33.754
will take you in.

00:16:39.554 --> 00:16:41.514
I appreciate your offer.

00:16:42.874 --> 00:16:45.195
But I'd rather die than get humiliated.

00:16:49.674 --> 00:16:50.674
All my misfortunes

00:16:51.475 --> 00:16:53.034
originated from your Xue family.

00:16:53.715 --> 00:16:54.274
Therefore,

00:16:54.914 --> 00:16:56.595
I'll never accept your help.

00:17:00.075 --> 00:17:00.995
Besides,

00:17:04.594 --> 00:17:05.675
your hospitality

00:17:06.834 --> 00:17:10.514
is just a ploy to extract
Grand Tutor Zhou's secrets.

00:17:13.314 --> 00:17:15.395
I know you are smart.

00:17:15.554 --> 00:17:16.435
Forget it.

00:17:18.794 --> 00:17:19.915
I'll never talk.

00:17:22.034 --> 00:17:24.074
Maybe you should try.

00:17:26.834 --> 00:17:27.675
There's nothing

00:17:27.754 --> 00:17:28.675
to discuss with him.

00:17:29.274 --> 00:17:30.074
In our line of work,

00:17:30.235 --> 00:17:31.274
we have principles.

00:17:32.114 --> 00:17:34.074
We've been rivals since forever.

00:17:34.274 --> 00:17:34.995
Talk to me.

00:17:35.354 --> 00:17:36.715
I'll avenge you.

00:17:36.915 --> 00:17:37.875
Drop the act.

00:17:38.955 --> 00:17:40.715
You're birds of a feather.

00:17:42.114 --> 00:17:43.155
Educate yourself.

00:17:43.235 --> 00:17:44.034
Bullies!

00:17:45.955 --> 00:17:46.715
He ran away again.

00:17:47.675 --> 00:17:48.114
Let's

00:17:48.834 --> 00:17:49.354
split up.

00:17:50.314 --> 00:17:52.675
He knows
what Grand Tutor Zhou is scheming.

00:17:52.715 --> 00:17:54.155
That's why he fled.

00:17:54.754 --> 00:17:56.594
First to find him wins. Agreed?

00:17:56.915 --> 00:17:57.274
Deal.

00:17:57.915 --> 00:17:59.875
How about the winner kisses the loser?

00:18:00.074 --> 00:18:00.875
Filthy.

00:18:01.675 --> 00:18:02.995
The loser kisses the winner?

00:18:03.195 --> 00:18:04.034
Despicable.

00:18:06.274 --> 00:18:06.675
Listen.

00:18:07.235 --> 00:18:08.915
Hide for now.

00:18:09.475 --> 00:18:11.514
I must meet His Majesty in the morning.

00:18:11.995 --> 00:18:12.354
Alright.

00:18:13.034 --> 00:18:13.554
Stay safe.

00:18:30.875 --> 00:18:33.475
(At this hour, His Majesty
shouldn't be here.)

00:18:41.675 --> 00:18:42.354
Your Majesty,

00:18:42.715 --> 00:18:45.354
the Imperial Kitchen prepared
red date and longan congee

00:18:45.554 --> 00:18:47.794
with astragalus, angelica, longan,

00:18:47.915 --> 00:18:49.314
and red dates as key ingredients.

00:18:49.594 --> 00:18:51.635
This is to regulate your digestion

00:18:51.834 --> 00:18:53.114
and nourish your vitality.

00:18:53.554 --> 00:18:55.274
Though Your Majesty has recovered,

00:18:56.074 --> 00:18:56.754
your devotion

00:18:57.435 --> 00:18:58.754
to state affairs

00:18:59.754 --> 00:19:01.715
still takes a toll on your health.

00:19:02.675 --> 00:19:03.915
To strengthen your stamina,

00:19:04.635 --> 00:19:05.274
I present

00:19:05.875 --> 00:19:08.354
three Crimson Pills.

00:19:09.475 --> 00:19:09.995
Your Majesty,

00:19:10.554 --> 00:19:12.635
take one Crimson Pill every day

00:19:13.395 --> 00:19:15.435
for longevity.

00:19:15.915 --> 00:19:17.034
I appreciate it.

00:19:20.594 --> 00:19:22.195
(Why did he bring pills?)

00:19:22.715 --> 00:19:24.274
(We never mentioned it.)

00:21:25.354 --> 00:21:26.715
Just regular pills?

00:21:28.114 --> 00:21:29.274
What do you think they are?

00:21:46.354 --> 00:21:47.475
The Crimson Pills

00:21:48.475 --> 00:21:50.915
are made with rare herbs and gold foil,

00:21:51.435 --> 00:21:52.475
refined through heat.

00:21:53.675 --> 00:21:54.915
They strengthen the body,

00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:56.274
prolong life,

00:21:57.635 --> 00:21:59.834
and many nobles consume them.

00:22:04.875 --> 00:22:05.794
You think I poisoned

00:22:06.554 --> 00:22:07.274
the pills?

00:22:10.754 --> 00:22:11.875
You were fine yesterday.

00:22:12.955 --> 00:22:13.514
Has someone

00:22:14.834 --> 00:22:16.715
been whispering doubts

00:22:17.235 --> 00:22:18.074
to you?

00:22:21.314 --> 00:22:22.195
Not at all.

00:22:23.155 --> 00:22:24.314
I'm just curious

00:22:25.274 --> 00:22:27.955
why you would
present pills to His Majesty.

00:22:33.074 --> 00:22:33.554
Feng.

00:22:34.635 --> 00:22:35.794
I'm a charlatan.

00:22:36.594 --> 00:22:37.875
I need unconventional methods

00:22:38.395 --> 00:22:40.034
to earn Emperor Jia's trust.

00:22:41.314 --> 00:22:42.834
Having served by his side for years,

00:22:43.195 --> 00:22:45.514
how could you not know what he thinks?

00:22:47.675 --> 00:22:48.594
These pills

00:22:49.635 --> 00:22:51.274
merely provide him peace of mind.

00:22:55.314 --> 00:22:56.395
You could discuss

00:22:57.235 --> 00:22:58.554
anything with me.

00:22:59.514 --> 00:23:01.114
Why don't you just ask me directly?

00:23:02.235 --> 00:23:03.554
I've never questioned

00:23:04.155 --> 00:23:05.554
the remedies you gave me.

00:23:12.955 --> 00:23:13.594
I knew it.

00:23:15.195 --> 00:23:16.594
Time changes everything.

00:23:18.554 --> 00:23:19.955
We've been apart for too long.

00:23:20.915 --> 00:23:22.554
You've become his pawn.

00:23:23.715 --> 00:23:24.354
Emperor Jia

00:23:25.235 --> 00:23:26.875
also sees me as his greatest threat.

00:23:27.875 --> 00:23:28.675
Meanwhile,

00:23:29.754 --> 00:23:31.314
I feel exactly the same about him.

00:23:32.314 --> 00:23:33.354
I hadn't done anything.

00:23:33.675 --> 00:23:34.754
But even if I had,

00:23:35.475 --> 00:23:36.995
there would be just cause.

00:23:45.834 --> 00:23:47.195
Your integrity shines bright.

00:23:48.074 --> 00:23:50.794
You'd never commit such base acts.

00:23:57.675 --> 00:23:58.395
If...

00:23:59.794 --> 00:24:01.715
If I truly poisoned him,

00:24:03.074 --> 00:24:04.235
would you expose me?

00:24:07.155 --> 00:24:07.995
If you do so,

00:24:09.074 --> 00:24:10.754
Emperor Jia will promote you.

00:24:11.514 --> 00:24:12.475
I wouldn't blame you.

00:24:13.395 --> 00:24:14.475
If death comes,

00:24:15.635 --> 00:24:17.155
I'd rather die by your hand.

00:24:22.034 --> 00:24:23.435
I'd never do that.

00:24:28.554 --> 00:24:29.195
Feng.

00:24:31.955 --> 00:24:33.034
What I miss the most

00:24:34.314 --> 00:24:36.514
is the way you stood by my side.
