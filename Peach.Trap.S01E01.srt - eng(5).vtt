00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.460
Three years ago,

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.540
during what I thought was
my greatest slump in life,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.010
like a miracle...

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.950
I met my first love.

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:13.070
He's a bit taller than me...

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.560
And unbelievably affectionate.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.320
Wow.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.170
Did you see this email?

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.880
It was Yoo Doha.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:16.810
What's going on?

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.970
Look at this.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.450
The team leader is here.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:57.800
What are you doing?

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.490
-Morning, Mr. Jeon—
-The director wants to see you.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.470
Come in.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.820
It really wasn't me, Director.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.160
I got a tip-off that
they got it from you, Mr. Yoo Doha.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.079
Do you have any other evidence?

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.900
Tip-offs are baseless.
Anyone can say anything.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.780
Do you think I didn't look into it?

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.579
How can you believe that?

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.079
Only you and I have
this final draft proposal.

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.540
Are you saying I leaked it?

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.790
No... that's not what I meant.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.060
The advertiser has this proposal too.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.920
Are you saying we should
interrogate them about it?

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.900
If we want to keep this advertiser,

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.430
someone has to
take responsibility for this.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.710
Do you get the picture now, Mr. Yoo Doha?

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.970
But I just started work here...

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.410
Exactly ten months ago.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.530
Did Yoo Doha really leak it?

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.240
Isn't he the new employee?

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.960
I guess the rumors are true.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.210
I'll pay you two months' compensation.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.810
Let's wrap this up like this.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.010
I'll make sure it doesn't
affect you getting a new job.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:42.530
Doha.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.930
You left your employee badge.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.190
Going down.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.320
The elevator door is closing.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.320
Going down. The elevator door is closing.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:09.710
Mr. Jeon.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.340
Let's skip the goodbye pleasantries.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.690
But still, thank you for everything.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.590
Thank you for your hard work these months.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.880
The elevator door is closing.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.970
Didn't you say to
skip the goodbye pleasantries?

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:40.970
Today's fortune?

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:44.320
Pft. What fortune?

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.640
You'll meet your lucky star today.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.880
Identify your lucky star
by the color green.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.700
Did my lucky star
die before getting to me?

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.880
Who is it?

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.050
What did you ring the doorbell for?

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.190
Who else would come here other than me?

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.120
What were you doing?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.300
I was just resting.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:19.710
What about your dojo?

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.420
Today is Hanwool's shift.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.230
Oh, right.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.050
But...

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.610
something's off with you today.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.020
They say my lucky color today is green.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:32.800
Green?

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.070
And?

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.230
Do you want some soju?

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:42.240
Goodness!

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:44.200
Hey!

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.730
You can't hold your liquor.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:49.630
What happened?

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.430
What? And you just accepted it?

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.090
At least I got the compensation.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.820
That's not the issue right now.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:03.150
Didn't your team say anything?

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:04.630
Nothing?

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:17.840
Yes, Mr. Jeon.

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:20.140
Sorry?

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.900
U-Uh, no, you didn't have to...

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.780
What? What did he say?

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.080
He told me...
to come to the farewell party.

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.160
What party when you fired him?

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:43.100
Yes, that's it!

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:46.780
Drink up. You've worked hard.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.220
It's a pity to suddenly say goodbye.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:48.960
Yeah.

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:52.370
Here, cheers.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.120
Hey, drink with us too.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.650
-Cheers!
-Cheers.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.530
You've worked hard.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.230
Doha.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:05.960
Here, I'll pour you a drink too.

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:08.240
Forget everything.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.810
All kinds of absurd things happen in life.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:13.200
Cheers!

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.180
Everyone, bottoms up!

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:18.630
-Bottoms up!
-Cheers!

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:19.590
Mr. Jeon!

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.410
What the hell?

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.310
My farewell party is just an excuse
for them to drink.

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:31.740
Drink up.

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:36.970
Nice.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.470
Doha, well, is it true?

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:44.210
Sorry?

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:47.900
Hey, come on.
Doha's not that kind of person.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.820
Then would the director leak it?

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.950
Why'd he shoot himself in the foot?

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.380
Watch what you say.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:55.800
Doha isn't that kind of person.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.440
I...

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.720
But it doesn't make sense!

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.320
Who could've leaked it then?

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.270
Honestly,

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.470
I'm not the only one who's curious, am I?

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:06.890
That's enough.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.050
Hey...

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:26.810
Are you that curious about it?

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.370
What's with th-that glare?

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.750
You're no longer in the company,
but still...

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:34.810
Doha, I'm your senior.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.300
You don't care about manners a-anymore?

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.950
That's right.
I'm no longer in the company.

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:46.080
What seniority are you talking about?

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:47.960
Did I leak it?

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.130
No, I didn't! It wasn't me!

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:52.880
The company needed a fall guy...

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.820
so I, the pushover, was fired.

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.420
What farewell party is this?

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.600
Why did you even call me here?

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:07.430
I can't believe you guys.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.950
Good luck with your lives.

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:14.350
I'll take my leave.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.700
Doha...

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.170
Wait.

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:19.780
That's not what I meant.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.660
Gosh.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.140
I thought you were just one to take it.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.740
So you know how to fight back.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:52.680
Thank you.

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.120
Do you always cry a lot?

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.370
When did I cry?

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:02.600
You were just crying.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:07.390
And don't you remember that time?

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:09.050
You cried in the elevator too.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.300
I got it. Please stop.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.540
I know you're innocent.

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:41.680
Mr. Jeon.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.990
Why do you trust me?

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.480
Because I've been watching you.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.680
You were in my team.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.670
Drink slowly.

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:09.940
Mr. Jeon...

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.510
I thought you hated me.

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:18.280
You were always cold to me
and gave me one-word responses.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.450
You only talk more when you scold me.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.870
I scolded you
because I had high hopes for you.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.170
Finish this and go home.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.720
Right, I got fired.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.859
It's nice that I don't have to go to work.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:59.510
Please show some mercy, Master.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:04.090
You've improved a lot.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.850
This is Yoo Doha. Over.

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:28.560
You just woke up?

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.020
Yeah, why?

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.580
What do you mean "why"?

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:32.760
Did you not see

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.960
all my calls and texts since yesterday?

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:36.120
Calls and texts?

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.350
Are you home?

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.330
Where are you?

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:41.210
Are you drunk?

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.540
Yoo Doha, reply!

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:44.990
Over!

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.720
Hey.

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:48.150
Did you black out from all the drinking?

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:49.480
Call me when you wake up.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.380
Sorry, I just saw them.

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.110
Come exercise if you're awake.

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:58.480
Hey, my body's stuck to my bed right now.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.280
Already sounding so unemployed.

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:04.130
Exercising and sweating
is the best hangover cure.

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.590
Well, you wouldn't understand that anyway.

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:09.360
What? Unemployed? Just you wait.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:14.930
Wow, it's been ten years,
but he still reacts the same way.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.840
Hurting me and then healing my wound?

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:37.790
Anyway, thanks.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:49.530
I'm no longer in the company.
What seniority are you talking about?

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.370
No, I didn't! It wasn't me!

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:54.070
I thought you hated me.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:55.740
You were always cold to me
and gave me one-word responses.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.970
You only talk more when you scold me.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:10.340
Hello, Mr. Jeon.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:12.330
Yes.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.930
Sorry? Today?

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.920
Why isn't he here yet?

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.470
I'm sorry.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.660
I was drunk and offended you yesterday.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.670
I didn't call you here to scold you.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.230
Then why...

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:05.520
Are you going to stay standing?

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:06.470
Oh, right.

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:11.890
What do you want to drink?

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.010
Uh, no! I'll order it myself.

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:18.420
Ice latte, less ice. Am I right?

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.640
Today's drink is free.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:23.490
No, you shouldn't.

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:26.140
Oh, come on, just take it.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:29.210
Why haven't you been here for so long?

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:32.620
Thank you. I was busy...

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.330
This is my number.

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:50.920
I kind of missed you
when I didn't see you around.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.130
Sorry?

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.840
Can we be friends?

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:03.900
Oh... Okay, I'll contact you.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.660
Enjoy your drink.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:13.980
Oh?

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.860
Lucky color, green.

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:20.030
Are you close to him?

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.460
I came here often when I was working.

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:28.190
He's really friendly.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.240
He wasn't friendly to me.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.650
Anyway, I have an offer for you.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.190
What's taking him so long?

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:25.780
The number you've dialed
is not available...

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.780
I'll be right back.

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:33.790
Wait, I know that look of yours...

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:35.780
Pissed off mode.

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:40.150
For me?

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.920
Is there anyone else here I'm talking to?

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:47.410
Well, this is so sudden...

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.390
What I mean is...

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.150
If you're wondering why
I'm providing a job offer

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:56.670
to someone who was fired
for breaching company policy,

00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:59.210
I don't think you leaked the proposal,

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:02.920
and I'm confident in your competence.

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:22.870
Yoo Doha!

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:27.450
[Peach Trap]

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:09.540
Young man.

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:14.340
You were framed and fired, right?

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:21.000
Sorry?

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:31.220
With work,
things will work out in the end.

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.050
But...

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:36.850
work isn't your
greatest concern right now.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:40.870
What do you mean?

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:43.530
There's something else
you should worry about.

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:50.120
Heard about
the fortune of fatal attraction?

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.430
But I've been single all my life.

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:54.420
Exactly.

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:57.080
The peach tree of attraction
has blossomed now.

00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:05.350
Peach blossoms and sparks flying
everywhere.

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.330
Do you know what flowers attract?

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:15.670
Bees... or butterflies?

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:18.000
Sure, they attract bees and butterflies,

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.520
but they also attract pests.

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:25.340
Be careful.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.330
I'm not buying your fan.

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:44.810
It's about to be a sea of peach blossoms!

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:47.870
What a strange person.

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:59.830
It's about to be a sea of peach blossoms.
