DEAR X

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:55.722
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:57.432
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.828
- Thank you.
- Be careful.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:20.163
I will. Thank you.

00:01:23.374 --> 00:01:24.793
Are you all right, Mr. Choi?

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:27.545
Did you really ditch the shop
to go after that thief?

00:01:28.046 --> 00:01:29.047
That was so brave.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.757
Why do you keep going after
those guys?

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.760
- I'm fine. It was nothing.
- You should just become a cop.

00:01:33.843 --> 00:01:35.011
Don't be so dramatic.

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:36.221
Go. I'm fine.

00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:47.107
BASEBALL PRODIGY CHOI JUNG HO RETIRES
AFTER A STRING OF SETBACKS

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.943
FORMER BATTING TITLE CONTENDER
ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT

00:01:51.986 --> 00:01:53.530
I sometimes look back

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:57.200
on those moments just before
she opened the gates of hell.

00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:06.042
Was Ah Jin's encounter with that man
just a coincidence?

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:09.671
Or was it fate?

00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:12.882
- I'll see you next week.
- Take care.

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:16.302
I start work next week.

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:19.931
Isn't it a little too soon
to start a part-time job?

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:22.600
I just want to clear my head
for a while.

00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:30.650
I found you a place.
Here's the address and the door code.

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:36.406
It's too far from my school,
so I'll be staying with a friend.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.242
- The place is empty, so you can...
- No.

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:42.537
I'm going back to my place.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.831
But he knows where you live.

00:02:44.914 --> 00:02:47.792
He'll come looking for you again
and ask for money.

00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:49.752
I'm going to give him the money.

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:54.591
If I pay him regularly,
he won't beat me up.

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:57.927
That's the best I can do.

00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:07.729
Bye.

00:03:07.812 --> 00:03:09.230
You're moving out?

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:12.692
Why are you doing all this for her?

00:03:12.775 --> 00:03:14.027
Get a grip, Jun Seo.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.654
She's not part of your life anymore.

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:18.948
You're the one who did this.

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:22.744
You're the reason I can't let her go.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.454
What did I do?

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:26.122
When her dad tried to do
those awful things

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.457
you went along with it.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.042
After he went to prison

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:32.128
you threw her out on the streets
in the middle of winter.

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:34.339
You did that.

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:39.719
I did what I had to do.
I had to raise you.

00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:41.763
I was trying to take care of you.

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:47.810
Stop making excuses.

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.231
You were just another abuser to her.

00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:54.817
Jun Seo, don't do this to me.

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:57.445
Jun Seo.

00:03:58.446 --> 00:04:01.282
Jun Seo, I can't live without you!

00:04:02.992 --> 00:04:04.077
Jun Seo.

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:05.995
This is all because of her.

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:08.081
That devil.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.462
EPISODE 3: BREAKING THE SHACKLES

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:15.922
We begin with our top story.

00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:17.757
Random killings are on the rise

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.927
alongside a recent wave
of stalking-related crimes.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.804
In Nojeong-dong,
a string of murder victims

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:28.893
were all found to have suffered
ongoing stalking before their deaths.

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:30.603
Now for the weekend forecast.

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:33.648
Most regions will see daytime highs
approaching 30 degrees

00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:35.275
as the heat continues
through the week.

00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:51.249
If you've finished, turn it in,
and you're free to go.

00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:52.875
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:02.093
Did you see that girl at the cafe?

00:05:02.176 --> 00:05:03.886
- Yes, I saw her.
- She's gorgeous.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.847
I know, right? She's a knockout.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.932
- Do you want to go see her?
- Do you?

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:09.350
- Are you down?
- Let's go.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:13.521
Enjoy your drinks.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.899
Excuse me. Do you have a boyfriend?

00:05:17.775 --> 00:05:18.776
Yes, I do.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.278
How about trading him for this guy?

00:05:20.361 --> 00:05:22.739
- He's good-looking and he's tall.
- Stop it.

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:26.242
- Stand up. He's almost 190cm.
- Dude, what's wrong with you?

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:32.290
I'm really sorry,
but my boyfriend's better-looking.

00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:33.958
I see.

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:36.085
Okay.

00:05:37.962 --> 00:05:40.965
Thank you.
Let me know if you need anything.

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:42.050
Sure.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.057
How many times
have you been hit on today?

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.641
All the customers are guys.

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:52.643
"Do you have a boyfriend?"

00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:54.479
Oh, right.

00:05:55.646 --> 00:05:57.315
Your photos are on social media.

00:05:58.316 --> 00:05:59.942
They're all over the internet.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.671
SHE'S LITERALLY FLAWLESS
I'M SO JEALOUS

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:22.340
SHE'D OUTSHINE LE NA IF SHE DEBUTED

00:06:22.423 --> 00:06:24.008
WHY ISN'T SHE A CELEBRITY ALREADY?

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:25.176
SHE'S GORGEOUS

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:33.476
Do you remember her?

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:37.146
Wait, isn't she the one
who turned us down

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.732
when we tried to scout her
a few years ago?

00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:40.817
That's right.

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:42.860
Here she is again.

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:44.904
It looks like
she's not with an agency yet.

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:47.532
Check again, just in case.

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:51.285
Aren't you worried about your photos
spreading online?

00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:54.080
Should I ask them to take them down?

00:06:54.747 --> 00:06:57.792
Just leave it.
It's good publicity for the cafe.

00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:01.754
You're really pretty,
and you've got a great attitude.

00:07:02.463 --> 00:07:04.132
No wonder Mr. Choi likes you.

00:07:09.303 --> 00:07:11.889
By the way,
what is he always watching?

00:07:13.724 --> 00:07:14.976
You don't know?

00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:18.146
He was the legendary .400 hitter
and home run king.

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:21.482
One swing and it was over.
It was an automatic home run.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:23.901
That's right.

00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:25.653
"One swing and it was over"?

00:07:25.736 --> 00:07:26.737
Yes.

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:28.990
He was huge back then.

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:31.200
What's he doing here, then?

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.955
Kwak Eun Hyeok
went for a reckless slide

00:07:36.038 --> 00:07:38.082
and Mr. Choi broke his wrist
trying to tag him out.

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:39.876
Three surgeries
and a year of rehab later

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:41.252
he still couldn't make a comeback.

00:07:41.335 --> 00:07:42.545
That was the end of his career.

00:07:45.047 --> 00:07:49.051
He ended Mr. Choi's career,
but everyone still cheered for him.

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:54.557
If I were him,
I wouldn't be able to watch baseball.

00:07:55.057 --> 00:07:56.184
You'd think so, right?

00:07:56.809 --> 00:07:59.437
Proud of you, my friend. Good job.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.773
He roots for the guy who ruined
his career and calls him a friend.

00:08:04.108 --> 00:08:05.902
Who knows what he's thinking?

00:08:08.696 --> 00:08:09.739
Welcome.

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:11.449
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:14.994
- I come bearing good news.
- Hello.

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:19.624
Who's that?

00:08:19.707 --> 00:08:22.376
He's Im Seung Yong, CEO of PB Agency.

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:25.505
Just between us

00:08:26.255 --> 00:08:28.174
Mr. Choi might be signing
a new contract.

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:32.595
I really hope he makes a comeback.

00:08:38.893 --> 00:08:40.728
- You came a long way.
- Thank you.

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:43.314
He's a good man through and through.

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:47.443
Why do you think

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:51.197
I met someone like him
at this point in my life?

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:56.160
Maybe he's your guardian spirit.

00:08:58.913 --> 00:09:01.290
- My guardian spirit?
- Yes.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.212
Isn't it better to believe
guardian spirits exist?

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.717
If you think they're giving you
these trials for a greater purpose

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:15.096
it makes life a little easier.

00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:21.727
If they really exist, like you said,
I wonder what their intention is.

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:30.444
Hello, this is Xanadu Coffee.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.408
Did the girl working there
finish her shift?

00:09:36.492 --> 00:09:37.577
Who's calling?

00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:39.370
None of your business.

00:09:40.454 --> 00:09:42.707
Can I get her number?

00:09:44.458 --> 00:09:45.668
Excuse me.

00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:48.004
You need to tell me
who you are first.

00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:51.257
Also, I can't just give out
personal information...

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:58.556
Damn, what a lunatic.

00:09:58.639 --> 00:09:59.640
Who was that?

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:02.727
Just another guy
asking for Ah Jin's number.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.522
At least be polite
if you're going to ask.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:09.275
Ah Jin.

00:10:09.358 --> 00:10:11.986
Yoo Sik and I
will throw that out later.

00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:14.530
You should go home.
It's getting late.

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:16.157
It's okay. I can do it.

00:10:16.782 --> 00:10:18.409
What if you miss the last bus?

00:10:19.493 --> 00:10:21.120
Sir, we're closed.

00:10:22.246 --> 00:10:23.456
We're closed for the day.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.293
But your sign is still lit.

00:10:27.376 --> 00:10:30.796
Sorry. Please come back tomorrow.
We have to lock up soon.

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:35.760
But I want to see her.

00:10:35.843 --> 00:10:36.844
Where's Ah Jin?

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:39.305
- Has she gone home yet?
- Well...

00:10:39.388 --> 00:10:43.559
Sir, please step outside.
You can come back tomorrow.

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:44.810
Why are you pushing me?

00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:48.105
- We have to close up now.
- Can you tell Ah Jin that...

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:49.774
Sorry, sir.

00:10:49.857 --> 00:10:52.276
Please come again tomorrow morning.

00:10:52.943 --> 00:10:54.028
Sorry about that.

00:11:11.837 --> 00:11:13.464
Did you move out?

00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:16.300
I only helped since I didn't want you
living with your mother.

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:18.678
Don't expect me
to keep supporting you.

00:11:18.761 --> 00:11:22.723
When I die,
you won't get a single penny from me.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:25.393
I understand.

00:11:29.271 --> 00:11:31.148
Writers barely make any money.

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:34.193
How do you expect to make a living?

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.989
You still can't kill
a single ant, can you?

00:11:39.073 --> 00:11:42.159
Every living creature
has a reason to live.

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:45.413
You sound just like him.

00:11:47.456 --> 00:11:49.208
Did you just laugh?

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:54.338
I was just glad to hear
I take after my dad.

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.465
Who else would you take after?

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:18.881
JUN SEO

00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:41.946
Ah Jin?

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:43.531
Ah Jin.

00:13:55.417 --> 00:13:56.961
What took you so long?

00:13:58.504 --> 00:14:01.131
Do you know
what almost happened to me?

00:14:01.715 --> 00:14:02.925
Ah Jin.

00:14:09.306 --> 00:14:10.891
Are you okay?

00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:13.269
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:14.770
Are you hurt?

00:14:15.229 --> 00:14:16.438
Jun Seo.

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:17.523
Yes.

00:14:19.441 --> 00:14:22.111
How far would you go for me?

00:14:28.909 --> 00:14:29.952
Answer me.

00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:32.955
How far would you go for me?

00:14:33.622 --> 00:14:34.832
I'd do anything for you.

00:14:35.833 --> 00:14:37.626
As long as it doesn't involve
killing someone

00:14:38.002 --> 00:14:40.212
I'll do anything you ask me.

00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:45.634
So you're letting your conscience
decide where the line is?

00:14:47.261 --> 00:14:49.471
- That's not what I mean.
- Don't worry.

00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:52.099
I never expected you
to go that far in the first place.

00:14:56.645 --> 00:14:59.773
If you were brave enough
to kill a man for me

00:14:59.857 --> 00:15:02.443
I'd have asked you
to start with Baek Seon Gyu.

00:15:09.658 --> 00:15:12.453
You can kill anything
besides a man for me then, right?

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:22.630
Help...

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:24.381
Help me.

00:15:25.674 --> 00:15:27.176
Please.

00:15:30.554 --> 00:15:33.724
If you want to spare your life,
forget what happened tonight.

00:15:33.807 --> 00:15:37.770
If you promise
to keep your mouth shut

00:15:37.853 --> 00:15:39.855
I can call you an ambulance.

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.523
I won't say a word.

00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:42.608
I promise.

00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:45.152
There's a man injured
in the second alley

00:15:45.235 --> 00:15:46.570
behind the Nojeong-gu townhouses.

00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:49.740
It looks like a random assault.
He's losing a lot of blood.

00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:42.793
Did you put the money
under the second flowerpot?

00:16:55.472 --> 00:16:56.473
Hey.

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.519
She's easy on the eyes.

00:17:02.229 --> 00:17:04.148
Get me a contact.

00:17:04.773 --> 00:17:07.901
Put her in front of a camera
or ship her off to some island.

00:17:08.485 --> 00:17:10.362
Just make sure it pays top dollar.

00:17:14.074 --> 00:17:17.870
I might have to sell an organ
to pay off the interest.

00:17:18.787 --> 00:17:22.207
I'm her father.
It's the least she can do for me.

00:17:23.333 --> 00:17:25.919
I made that girl.
I brought her into this world.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.880
She belongs to me.

00:17:28.964 --> 00:17:31.425
I'll do whatever I want with her.
Got a problem with that?

00:17:33.427 --> 00:17:34.470
Ah Jin.

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:47.566
What?

00:17:48.484 --> 00:17:50.903
Were you going to push me off
this building?

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:53.697
Don't do anything stupid.

00:17:54.823 --> 00:17:57.868
If you kill me, you'll be ostracized.

00:17:58.577 --> 00:18:01.371
Your life will be over, you bitch.

00:18:11.965 --> 00:18:13.175
You're pathetic.

00:18:14.176 --> 00:18:16.678
I get you hate your old man,
but how dare you?

00:18:17.805 --> 00:18:19.807
I can see right through you, bitch.

00:18:24.728 --> 00:18:26.522
Next month, I want double the money.

00:19:33.463 --> 00:19:34.548
Hey.

00:19:35.257 --> 00:19:38.510
I'm saying this
out of old times' sake.

00:19:39.386 --> 00:19:40.971
Stay away from that girl.

00:19:41.805 --> 00:19:43.098
She's bad news.

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:46.435
Don't let her ruin your life, okay?

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:07.414
What did he do to you?

00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:15.422
Jun Seo.

00:20:17.007 --> 00:20:18.592
Can you hit me?

00:20:19.092 --> 00:20:20.093
What?

00:20:20.177 --> 00:20:21.929
It has to look like
a stalker attacked me.

00:20:23.263 --> 00:20:24.681
Just hit me a few times.

00:20:30.354 --> 00:20:31.730
No.

00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:33.649
I can't do that.

00:20:34.524 --> 00:20:35.651
I won't.

00:20:36.526 --> 00:20:37.527
You won't?

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.529
I won't.

00:20:40.864 --> 00:20:42.449
Are you serious?

00:20:42.532 --> 00:20:43.784
I should ask you that.

00:20:43.867 --> 00:20:47.496
Are you seriously asking me
to hit you?

00:20:47.579 --> 00:20:48.997
It's nothing new.

00:20:50.749 --> 00:20:52.793
You've seen me get hit before.

00:20:52.876 --> 00:20:55.837
That's exactly why I can't hit you.

00:20:55.921 --> 00:21:00.050
It tore me apart,
and it still haunts me.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.395
Fine.

00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:15.232
I won't force you to do it.

00:21:17.526 --> 00:21:18.610
Jun Seo.

00:21:20.696 --> 00:21:23.615
I don't care if you get hurt

00:21:24.199 --> 00:21:26.702
but I don't want to be the one
who hurts you.

00:21:27.744 --> 00:21:29.204
I don't want to lose you.

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:36.128
You know I don't treat you
like I treat everyone else.

00:21:45.929 --> 00:21:46.930
Ah Jin.

00:21:48.265 --> 00:21:50.225
Sometimes, you scare me.

00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:56.481
But I think it's because
you weren't loved growing up

00:21:57.524 --> 00:21:59.359
so I don't know what to do.

00:22:04.239 --> 00:22:05.532
Ah Jin.

00:22:09.411 --> 00:22:10.704
I'll handle this.

00:22:47.032 --> 00:22:48.742
Did something happen?

00:22:48.825 --> 00:22:49.826
Pardon?

00:22:51.119 --> 00:22:53.872
No, nothing happened.

00:22:53.955 --> 00:22:55.457
It's just a little scratch.

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.709
You know you can tell me anything.

00:22:58.585 --> 00:23:00.170
Don't bottle it up.

00:23:02.714 --> 00:23:04.758
Believe it or not, I'm pretty strong.

00:23:05.634 --> 00:23:08.095
I've never lost a fight before.

00:23:08.178 --> 00:23:09.221
Okay?

00:23:12.766 --> 00:23:14.142
You don't believe me?

00:23:14.851 --> 00:23:16.144
I do.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.189
I may be the boss

00:23:19.272 --> 00:23:22.109
but you and Yoo Sik
are like family to me.

00:23:23.527 --> 00:23:28.532
So whatever it is,
go ahead and use me, okay?

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.410
Use you?

00:23:34.538 --> 00:23:35.997
That's right. Whatever it is.

00:23:37.124 --> 00:23:39.418
But you're my boss.

00:23:40.544 --> 00:23:42.963
That's what bosses are for.

00:23:43.463 --> 00:23:47.050
Since Jun Seo has classes
late at night

00:23:47.134 --> 00:23:48.718
I worry about you going home alone.

00:23:48.802 --> 00:23:51.179
You said it's just you
and your father, right?

00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:54.516
Yes, but my father lives far away.

00:23:56.226 --> 00:24:00.063
I'd feel a lot more at ease
if your father lived close by.

00:24:00.814 --> 00:24:02.232
What does he do?

00:24:03.275 --> 00:24:05.068
He just works at a company.

00:24:05.152 --> 00:24:06.695
He works the night shift.

00:24:07.404 --> 00:24:10.282
WOMEN'S RESTROOM

00:24:16.746 --> 00:24:17.998
Shit.

00:24:47.611 --> 00:24:51.406
How much would we make
if we used an actress

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.492
instead of planting hidden cameras?

00:24:54.784 --> 00:24:56.870
She's drop-dead gorgeous.

00:24:58.705 --> 00:24:59.789
Yeah?

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:06.588
So I just need to drug her
and drop her off for a few hours?

00:25:09.216 --> 00:25:10.217
Shit.

00:25:14.721 --> 00:25:17.599
I found a hidden-camera offender.
I have proof, and I'm in pursuit.

00:25:37.327 --> 00:25:38.995
You little punk!

00:25:39.496 --> 00:25:43.083
If you hadn't called the cops
back then

00:25:43.166 --> 00:25:45.585
I wouldn't have gone to prison!

00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:50.840
My life is fucked up because of you!

00:25:52.259 --> 00:25:53.301
Baek Ah Jin.

00:25:54.302 --> 00:25:56.054
She's your daughter.

00:25:57.514 --> 00:26:01.893
I brought her into this world,
so I'll do what I want with her.

00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:04.604
Stay out of it.

00:26:17.826 --> 00:26:24.708
She belongs to me
until the day she dies, you bastard.

00:26:24.791 --> 00:26:27.168
Die!

00:27:20.347 --> 00:27:21.640
Police! Step away!

00:27:24.267 --> 00:27:25.894
You're under arrest for assault.

00:27:30.732 --> 00:27:31.733
Sir, are you okay?

00:27:32.567 --> 00:27:33.568
I think so.

00:27:37.781 --> 00:27:38.990
Can you stand?

00:27:42.494 --> 00:27:43.495
This way.

00:27:45.497 --> 00:27:48.958
YEONGDONG POLICE STATION

00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:51.336
So you two were step-siblings.

00:27:51.419 --> 00:27:55.882
After your parents split up,
you kept stalking Baek Ah Jin.

00:27:56.841 --> 00:28:00.679
And when her father found out,
you threatened to kill him?

00:28:02.138 --> 00:28:03.139
Ah Jin.

00:28:05.266 --> 00:28:07.560
Do you have proof
that he's been stalking you?

00:28:08.019 --> 00:28:09.020
Text messages, perhaps?

00:28:09.562 --> 00:28:13.066
A few days ago,
he was hiding at my place.

00:28:18.279 --> 00:28:19.531
And he did this to me.

00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:26.121
No, this man was the one
who did that to her.

00:28:26.204 --> 00:28:29.624
He collects hidden-camera footage
from restrooms and gambles illegally.

00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:33.545
I spoke with Detective Jin Dong Gyu
so I could hand over the evidence.

00:28:33.628 --> 00:28:36.715
He did reach out to us.
So do you have the evidence?

00:28:37.507 --> 00:28:38.842
I do.

00:28:41.094 --> 00:28:42.220
It's on my phone.

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:44.514
Looking for this?

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:22.635
Show me the evidence.

00:29:23.928 --> 00:29:25.430
You said it was on your phone.

00:29:26.681 --> 00:29:27.682
Show me.

00:29:28.641 --> 00:29:31.603
If you filed a false report,
the charges will be even heavier!

00:29:41.237 --> 00:29:43.031
I'll be coming into some money soon.

00:29:43.114 --> 00:29:45.867
I'll contact you,
so don't reach out to me until then.

00:29:46.868 --> 00:29:48.620
You're not bluffing, right?

00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:52.582
If I'm lying,
you can do whatever you want to me.

00:29:54.042 --> 00:29:57.670
You've grown up. You really have.

00:30:00.215 --> 00:30:01.216
Call me.

00:30:05.261 --> 00:30:07.138
Damn it.

00:30:16.105 --> 00:30:17.106
Detective.

00:30:19.234 --> 00:30:22.737
May I have a moment with Jun Seo?

00:30:23.279 --> 00:30:24.864
I'm afraid not.

00:30:24.948 --> 00:30:28.284
It's against protocol for the victim
and the offender to have contact.

00:30:28.785 --> 00:30:30.912
Before all this happened,
we were siblings.

00:30:31.579 --> 00:30:34.541
I only need a minute. Please.

00:30:43.383 --> 00:30:44.551
What are you doing?

00:30:46.427 --> 00:30:48.513
If we go with your plan
and pin him as a petty offender

00:30:48.596 --> 00:30:50.306
he'll be out in a few years.

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:52.350
It won't change a thing.

00:30:52.809 --> 00:30:55.395
Don't be reckless.
You can't beat him.

00:30:58.356 --> 00:30:59.858
I said I'd handle it.

00:30:59.941 --> 00:31:02.694
You should've smashed his head
with that brick.

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:04.779
But you hesitated.

00:31:06.072 --> 00:31:08.032
That's why you can't beat him.

00:31:08.825 --> 00:31:10.118
So stay out of it.

00:31:13.663 --> 00:31:15.832
Ah Jin.

00:31:16.499 --> 00:31:17.500
Ah Jin.

00:31:32.974 --> 00:31:34.809
Mr. Choi was
a professional athlete, right?

00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:37.186
One swing and it was over.
It was an automatic home run.

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:38.938
"One swing and it was over"?

00:31:39.022 --> 00:31:40.565
Don't do anything stupid.

00:31:41.232 --> 00:31:44.485
If you kill me, you'll be ostracized.

00:31:44.819 --> 00:31:48.156
You and Yoo Sik
are like family to me.

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:53.328
Whatever it is,
go ahead and use me, okay?

00:32:15.516 --> 00:32:17.393
- Hey, Ah Jin.
- Good morning.

00:32:18.311 --> 00:32:19.687
What happened to your face?

00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:21.606
I fell.

00:32:22.398 --> 00:32:25.652
You expect me to believe that?
That's not from a fall.

00:32:25.735 --> 00:32:27.070
I'm okay.

00:32:28.112 --> 00:32:31.491
Tell me the truth.
Who did this to you?

00:32:32.283 --> 00:32:33.910
And that scratch on your neck.

00:32:33.993 --> 00:32:36.079
Tell me what really happened.

00:32:36.162 --> 00:32:37.288
Well...

00:32:38.665 --> 00:32:40.416
The thing is...

00:32:41.125 --> 00:32:44.337
I didn't say anything
because I didn't want you to worry.

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:49.425
But some guy has been following me
for a few days now.

00:32:51.052 --> 00:32:53.763
We had a bit of a scuffle last night.

00:32:53.846 --> 00:32:55.056
Did you call the police?

00:32:55.515 --> 00:33:00.228
They said, unless he assaults me
or commits a crime

00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:03.481
there's not much they can do
if the stalker denies it.

00:33:06.067 --> 00:33:09.696
Jun Seo is staying with his grandpa
for a few days

00:33:09.779 --> 00:33:11.489
so I am a little worried.

00:33:17.412 --> 00:33:18.496
This won't do.

00:33:18.579 --> 00:33:20.081
- Yoo Sik.
- Yes?

00:33:20.164 --> 00:33:22.625
- Close up by yourself for now.
- What?

00:33:22.709 --> 00:33:24.585
I'll take her home
for the time being.

00:33:25.211 --> 00:33:27.547
- But...
- Thank you, Mr. Choi.

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:35.471
Take it.

00:33:36.639 --> 00:33:37.724
What's this?

00:33:38.474 --> 00:33:42.061
It's pepper spray. You might need it.

00:33:44.105 --> 00:33:47.025
Thank you for looking out for me.

00:33:49.235 --> 00:33:51.279
I hope you never have to use it.

00:33:53.364 --> 00:33:55.616
Do you ever regret it?

00:33:56.409 --> 00:33:58.786
Regret what?

00:34:01.247 --> 00:34:04.125
Helping someone
when it isn't really your problem.

00:34:05.418 --> 00:34:08.296
Sacrificing yourself for no gain.

00:34:09.172 --> 00:34:13.968
Forgiving and rooting for the friend
who ruined your career.

00:34:15.595 --> 00:34:18.014
I don't know.

00:34:18.765 --> 00:34:19.849
Do I regret it?

00:34:22.226 --> 00:34:23.311
Not really.

00:34:24.562 --> 00:34:26.856
I'm not the type to dwell on regrets.

00:34:28.232 --> 00:34:29.442
It's just how I am.

00:34:33.696 --> 00:34:37.700
What if it backfires
and you end up hurting yourself?

00:34:39.243 --> 00:34:41.871
I just follow my conscience.

00:34:42.789 --> 00:34:45.583
I can't get anything done
when my conscience feels heavy.

00:34:46.292 --> 00:34:51.047
Even if I end up getting hurt,
if that's the result of my choice

00:34:51.631 --> 00:34:53.049
then so be it.

00:34:58.763 --> 00:35:01.182
I hope you never change.

00:35:01.974 --> 00:35:04.227
It's better for you that way.

00:35:06.687 --> 00:35:10.399
You're a good person.

00:35:14.654 --> 00:35:16.364
Hey, kiddo.

00:35:17.406 --> 00:35:19.033
He's a good adult.

00:35:20.284 --> 00:35:23.246
He's driven by justice
and willing to help others.

00:35:23.329 --> 00:35:24.622
Is that a compliment?

00:35:24.705 --> 00:35:28.042
He's the kind of adult
I need right now.

00:35:42.765 --> 00:35:43.975
Thank you.

00:35:44.517 --> 00:35:46.018
You live here alone?

00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:53.192
I'll get you a studio near the cafe.

00:35:53.901 --> 00:35:55.111
You should move.

00:35:56.863 --> 00:35:58.865
You can't live here by yourself.

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:04.954
The rent might be higher,
but safety comes first.

00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:06.497
That's a bit...

00:36:07.415 --> 00:36:10.585
You don't need to worry
about the deposit.

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:14.547
Think of it as an advance
on your severance.

00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:19.844
I appreciate your concern.
I'll think it over.

00:36:21.554 --> 00:36:22.555
Okay.

00:36:23.514 --> 00:36:24.599
Get home safely.

00:36:36.652 --> 00:36:38.362
What's wrong? What is it?

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.323
Shoot.

00:36:41.657 --> 00:36:43.242
What kind of psycho...

00:36:46.204 --> 00:36:47.413
What's that?

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:49.290
YOU'RE NEXT

00:36:49.373 --> 00:36:50.416
"You're next"?

00:36:59.508 --> 00:37:00.551
Hey!

00:37:01.594 --> 00:37:03.638
Ah Jin, go inside and lock the door.

00:37:31.249 --> 00:37:32.833
Stop right there!

00:37:33.751 --> 00:37:34.835
Stop!

00:37:53.312 --> 00:37:55.690
What are you doing out here?

00:37:55.773 --> 00:37:57.566
I told you to go inside
and lock the door.

00:37:58.067 --> 00:38:01.696
You went after the stalker,
so I couldn't just sit still.

00:38:02.655 --> 00:38:03.656
Are you okay?

00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:05.491
I'm fine.

00:38:08.035 --> 00:38:09.537
But I lost him.

00:38:10.705 --> 00:38:12.581
It's getting late.
You should go home.

00:38:12.665 --> 00:38:15.543
I can't leave you here alone.

00:38:17.044 --> 00:38:19.297
Let me at least take you
to a sauna or...

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:20.423
I'm okay.

00:38:20.506 --> 00:38:23.509
I already asked a friend
to come over.

00:38:24.385 --> 00:38:25.594
Don't worry.

00:38:26.262 --> 00:38:28.556
You should go. I'll head in too.

00:38:29.598 --> 00:38:30.599
All right.

00:39:23.778 --> 00:39:25.321
I left a bat by your door.

00:39:25.404 --> 00:39:27.656
It's better to be safe than sorry.

00:39:28.074 --> 00:39:31.118
Everything has its use.

00:39:32.244 --> 00:39:38.501
Even small things, if used right,
can turn into an opportunity.

00:39:39.835 --> 00:39:41.670
How about some beer
and fried chicken?

00:39:41.754 --> 00:39:43.589
- I'm too full.
- What do you say?

00:39:43.672 --> 00:39:44.757
Come on, let's go.

00:39:47.426 --> 00:39:48.719
I need to buy cigarettes.

00:39:50.638 --> 00:39:51.931
Where are you going?

00:39:52.014 --> 00:39:54.225
Hey, it's Ah Jin.

00:40:06.028 --> 00:40:07.571
Where do you think you're going?

00:40:07.655 --> 00:40:09.865
- Wait, I know her.
- Let's hit the karaoke.

00:40:10.366 --> 00:40:12.159
- I know her. Get off me.
- Let's go.

00:40:13.285 --> 00:40:14.620
Come on.

00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:16.997
- What are you doing?
- I'm not going home.

00:40:17.832 --> 00:40:18.916
Hurry up.

00:40:18.999 --> 00:40:21.544
Where's Ah Jin?
Has she gone home yet?

00:40:21.627 --> 00:40:24.213
- Let's go!
- What's the holdup?

00:40:24.296 --> 00:40:26.340
- Hurry up.
- I'm coming.

00:40:26.424 --> 00:40:27.425
Let's go.

00:40:27.508 --> 00:40:29.718
- What are you looking at?
- Hurry up.

00:41:18.934 --> 00:41:22.688
I'll give you the money.
Be at my place by 8 p.m.

00:41:22.771 --> 00:41:26.817
People only come to their senses
when they're scared.

00:41:32.698 --> 00:41:36.869
"Fortune may turn into misfortune.
Tread carefully."

00:41:37.995 --> 00:41:40.080
What the hell? How annoying.

00:41:51.717 --> 00:41:52.718
Morning.

00:41:53.928 --> 00:41:56.347
Ah Jin, someone's looking for you.

00:41:59.225 --> 00:42:00.309
You know her?

00:42:09.443 --> 00:42:10.444
Hello.

00:42:12.738 --> 00:42:16.534
Ah Jin, are you sure
you don't want to give acting a try?

00:42:17.034 --> 00:42:18.494
Why me?

00:42:19.828 --> 00:42:22.540
Aren't there tons of people
desperate to be actors?

00:42:22.623 --> 00:42:25.626
You were born with something
others don't have.

00:42:26.877 --> 00:42:28.087
Be honest with me.

00:42:29.088 --> 00:42:31.215
You have thought about it,
haven't you?

00:42:31.298 --> 00:42:35.094
You're right. You've been on my mind.

00:42:37.137 --> 00:42:39.890
But I can't right now.
I have to take care of something.

00:42:39.974 --> 00:42:42.393
Can I ask you what that is?

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.105
It's a family matter.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:50.693
If you're looking after
a sick family member, we can help.

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:54.280
No, it's something
I have to do myself.

00:42:55.739 --> 00:42:56.740
Oh, well.

00:42:58.826 --> 00:43:00.661
That's a shame.

00:43:01.453 --> 00:43:04.164
But you seem set on your decision.

00:43:04.915 --> 00:43:06.709
If you ever change your mind

00:43:06.792 --> 00:43:09.336
promise you'll work with me,
not anyone else.

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:13.257
I'll treat you better
than any other agency.

00:43:14.133 --> 00:43:15.134
I appreciate it.

00:43:15.718 --> 00:43:18.554
All right, then. I'll see you around.

00:43:25.853 --> 00:43:27.479
- Thank you for coming.
- Goodbye.

00:43:31.233 --> 00:43:32.943
Should I get your autograph now?

00:43:34.236 --> 00:43:36.155
I turned it down.

00:43:36.238 --> 00:43:37.281
Why?

00:43:37.364 --> 00:43:39.742
You'll be famous and rich.
What's not to like?

00:43:40.409 --> 00:43:42.244
I just like the way it is now.

00:43:43.912 --> 00:43:46.040
Jun Seo better watch out.

00:43:47.041 --> 00:43:49.126
His girlfriend might become
a superstar.

00:43:49.209 --> 00:43:52.129
Girlfriend? I'm not his girlfriend.

00:43:54.089 --> 00:43:56.884
You're not? Then what's the deal?

00:44:01.138 --> 00:44:02.306
Still no guardian?

00:44:09.146 --> 00:44:11.315
Nothing happened last night, right?

00:44:13.817 --> 00:44:17.237
I was too scared,
so I spent the night at my friend's.

00:44:18.447 --> 00:44:22.534
But when I got home this morning,
my place was a mess.

00:44:22.618 --> 00:44:24.495
I think someone broke in.

00:44:30.167 --> 00:44:32.670
Does Jun Seo know about this?

00:44:33.754 --> 00:44:36.507
I didn't want him to worry,
so I didn't tell him.

00:44:37.257 --> 00:44:39.176
I'll tell him
when he gets back tomorrow.

00:44:39.259 --> 00:44:40.761
I'm also thinking of moving.

00:44:41.261 --> 00:44:43.514
- What about tonight?
- Tonight?

00:44:44.556 --> 00:44:46.225
I'll have to manage.

00:44:51.855 --> 00:44:52.856
Then...

00:44:54.358 --> 00:44:57.444
Let's do this.
Sleep at my place tonight.

00:44:59.321 --> 00:45:01.448
I'll sleep somewhere else.

00:45:02.616 --> 00:45:05.160
I can stay at my parents' house.

00:45:06.537 --> 00:45:08.622
No, it's okay.

00:45:09.915 --> 00:45:14.712
You don't seem to get it.
This could be really dangerous.

00:45:16.213 --> 00:45:19.425
Don't you have a meeting
with your agent tonight?

00:45:19.508 --> 00:45:20.509
I do.

00:45:20.592 --> 00:45:22.928
I'll go to my parents'
after the meeting.

00:45:24.012 --> 00:45:26.724
So stay at my place tonight.

00:45:28.892 --> 00:45:31.937
Jun Seo will be back tomorrow,
so just until then.

00:45:32.604 --> 00:45:37.192
You should also reconsider moving
to a studio that's near the cafe.

00:45:37.609 --> 00:45:39.319
I will, Mr. Choi.

00:45:50.122 --> 00:45:52.124
It's raining cats and dogs out there.

00:45:53.041 --> 00:45:55.753
In movies, bad things happen
when it rains like this.

00:45:56.336 --> 00:45:58.505
You watch too many movies.

00:46:06.346 --> 00:46:08.098
What's wrong?

00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:09.600
Nothing.

00:46:10.559 --> 00:46:11.810
What is it?

00:46:15.939 --> 00:46:19.109
I think I saw the stalker
in the beanie last night.

00:46:19.902 --> 00:46:20.903
Where?

00:46:22.404 --> 00:46:23.572
At a convenience store.

00:46:24.531 --> 00:46:26.700
And he was with...

00:46:28.786 --> 00:46:29.953
Who was he with?

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:46.261
What happened?

00:46:46.887 --> 00:46:49.640
I'm sorry.
I didn't sleep so well last night.

00:46:52.559 --> 00:46:54.311
Wait here. I'll grab some ointment.

00:47:02.611 --> 00:47:04.780
Didn't you say you had
a memorial service to get to?

00:47:05.489 --> 00:47:07.366
Shouldn't you be on your way?

00:47:08.325 --> 00:47:10.410
You're right. I should.

00:47:54.746 --> 00:47:55.956
To Gudeok-dong?

00:47:56.748 --> 00:47:57.749
Get in.

00:47:59.585 --> 00:48:01.545
It's Building A, Unit 504.

00:48:01.628 --> 00:48:04.298
I'll text you the door code.
Just punch that in and go inside.

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:06.550
Thank you.
Good luck with your meeting.

00:48:06.633 --> 00:48:08.260
Text me if you need anything.

00:48:08.343 --> 00:48:09.344
Okay.

00:48:27.279 --> 00:48:28.614
Sir.

00:48:28.697 --> 00:48:32.451
Could you take me to 13 Nojeong-dong
instead of Gudeok-dong?

00:48:43.712 --> 00:48:47.925
Mr. Choi, I need to stop by my place
to grab a few things.

00:48:53.639 --> 00:48:56.767
What? Right now?
Are you going to be okay?

00:48:56.850 --> 00:48:58.518
I would have gone with you, then.

00:49:04.524 --> 00:49:05.817
It'll only take a minute.

00:49:06.902 --> 00:49:09.404
I just need to grab my wallet and ID.

00:49:13.283 --> 00:49:15.953
Ask the driver to wait
in front of your place.

00:49:16.745 --> 00:49:18.497
Call me if anything happens.

00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:53.615
I thought you ran off.

00:49:53.699 --> 00:49:57.160
You told me to be here at this time.
What took you so long?

00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:01.415
You must be mad I kept you waiting.

00:50:02.749 --> 00:50:04.710
You weren't the only one
who had to wait.

00:50:04.793 --> 00:50:07.170
I've also been waiting
for this moment.

00:50:08.255 --> 00:50:10.173
Cut the crap and give me the money.

00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:12.676
I'll give you the money.

00:50:15.095 --> 00:50:16.638
But can you put this on first?

00:50:17.973 --> 00:50:19.099
What's this?

00:50:19.182 --> 00:50:20.392
It's a gift.

00:50:22.227 --> 00:50:24.563
Ever since I was little

00:50:26.023 --> 00:50:27.315
I used to wonder

00:50:28.108 --> 00:50:32.529
how nice it'd be if we got along
and had a good relationship.

00:50:35.699 --> 00:50:40.203
Now that I'm earning money,
I wanted to get you something nice.

00:50:41.872 --> 00:50:44.166
I'll give you the money,
so put this on.

00:50:44.249 --> 00:50:45.625
It's your birthday gift, Dad.

00:50:46.793 --> 00:50:48.003
You've lost your mind.

00:50:48.795 --> 00:50:50.255
Calling me "Dad"?

00:50:51.089 --> 00:50:52.883
What are you up to?

00:50:52.966 --> 00:50:54.718
Just try it on.

00:50:54.801 --> 00:50:57.220
It's not that difficult.

00:50:57.929 --> 00:51:00.682
Just put it on for me.

00:51:01.183 --> 00:51:03.351
If you do that,
I'll give you the money.

00:51:10.692 --> 00:51:12.027
Did you put poison on this?

00:51:12.736 --> 00:51:13.904
I'll put it on for you.

00:51:23.455 --> 00:51:24.456
Dad.

00:51:30.337 --> 00:51:31.797
You look so good.

00:51:34.424 --> 00:51:35.842
It really suits you.

00:51:51.441 --> 00:51:54.736
All right. I put it on.
Now, give me the money.

00:52:13.713 --> 00:52:15.090
You've changed.

00:52:15.423 --> 00:52:18.593
You used to be so spiteful.
Maybe you're finally growing up.

00:52:20.262 --> 00:52:22.389
You need to toughen up.

00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:25.892
You have to be ruthless to survive.

00:52:25.976 --> 00:52:28.186
It's a cruel world out there.

00:52:28.728 --> 00:52:32.065
It can turn on you in a second.

00:53:06.099 --> 00:53:07.893
You crazy bitch.

00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:18.028
Did you actually think
I'd give you the money?

00:53:18.111 --> 00:53:20.822
You'll just take the money and leave.

00:53:24.701 --> 00:53:29.748
But you know what?
I need you today, Dad.

00:53:30.707 --> 00:53:33.793
Tell me. Do you want to kill me now?

00:53:37.839 --> 00:53:40.842
If that's what you want,
I'll kill you.

00:53:40.926 --> 00:53:42.135
You little...

00:53:44.304 --> 00:53:45.597
Come here.

00:53:51.853 --> 00:53:53.480
Did you have fun?

00:53:54.439 --> 00:53:56.399
You should smile. This is fun, right?

00:53:57.025 --> 00:53:58.193
Stand up.

00:54:00.028 --> 00:54:02.364
- Hey, Ah Jin.
- I'm calling the police!

00:54:02.447 --> 00:54:04.324
Go ahead. Call them.

00:54:04.407 --> 00:54:06.785
- Help!
- Hello? Ah Jin?

00:54:07.869 --> 00:54:08.870
Ah Jin...

00:54:33.561 --> 00:54:36.481
The call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message...

00:54:36.982 --> 00:54:39.234
YEONGDONG POLICE STATION

00:54:41.152 --> 00:54:43.196
CALLING AH JIN

00:54:52.831 --> 00:54:53.915
Get over here.

00:54:54.958 --> 00:54:56.543
MR. CHOI

00:54:57.043 --> 00:54:58.044
Shit.

00:55:07.053 --> 00:55:09.973
- This is the police.
- There's been a break-in.

00:55:10.598 --> 00:55:11.808
What's the address?

00:55:11.891 --> 00:55:13.101
Nojeong-dong.

00:55:13.184 --> 00:55:14.561
Are you near Nojeong Station?

00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:17.314
No, not near the station.

00:55:17.897 --> 00:55:19.566
Could you give me the exact address?

00:55:20.025 --> 00:55:22.986
I don't know the exact address.

00:55:30.535 --> 00:55:32.078
I have to endure this.

00:55:32.162 --> 00:55:34.789
It takes ten minutes
to get here from the cafe.

00:55:36.791 --> 00:55:38.501
I just need to hold on
for ten minutes.

00:55:43.089 --> 00:55:44.090
Hey.

00:55:44.799 --> 00:55:47.177
Hey...hey!

00:55:50.764 --> 00:55:52.432
I won't let you die so easily.

00:55:53.183 --> 00:55:54.976
I don't have the money in my hands.

00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:57.062
Why did you have to piss me off?

00:56:01.483 --> 00:56:02.776
Damn it.

00:56:11.743 --> 00:56:14.996
What? Do you want some more of this?

00:56:18.875 --> 00:56:20.502
I'll give you the money!

00:56:41.189 --> 00:56:42.357
Shit.

00:56:57.205 --> 00:56:58.206
Shit.

00:57:01.709 --> 00:57:02.794
Damn it!

00:57:10.593 --> 00:57:11.594
Fuck.

00:57:12.554 --> 00:57:14.639
Fucking bitch!

00:57:35.827 --> 00:57:38.913
Do I have to break your hand
for you to be a good girl?

00:58:36.137 --> 00:58:39.641
You were pretty
even when you were a baby.

00:58:45.939 --> 00:58:47.023
Cry.

00:58:49.108 --> 00:58:50.485
Wah.

00:58:51.778 --> 00:58:52.779
Come on.

00:58:55.698 --> 00:58:57.492
Cry for me.

00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:03.831
That's it.

00:59:13.049 --> 00:59:14.425
That's what I'm talking about!

00:59:14.509 --> 00:59:18.721
Ah Jin wagered her life
in a gamble with God.

00:59:37.699 --> 00:59:39.576
You crazy bastard! Get off her!

00:59:44.956 --> 00:59:47.792
Ah Jin, are you okay?

00:59:49.752 --> 00:59:50.962
Fuck you!

00:59:59.971 --> 01:00:02.432
She's young enough
to be your daughter!

01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:09.981
Ah Jin, are you all right?

01:00:10.648 --> 01:00:12.400
Can you hear me?

01:00:13.151 --> 01:00:14.444
Look at you.

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:20.074
You son of a bitch!

01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:57.987
And in that wager

01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:01.741
God took her side.

01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:24.305
My dad...

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:29.435
Please come and help my dad.

01:01:30.728 --> 01:01:34.065
He's bleeding so much.

01:01:35.566 --> 01:01:37.110
My dad...

01:01:37.735 --> 01:01:39.821
It's 13 Nojeong-dong, Nojeong-gu.

01:01:41.072 --> 01:01:42.281
The rooftop house.

01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:46.202
Please save my dad's life.

01:01:50.456 --> 01:01:52.208
Please hurry.

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:21.988
And so, she offered up a sacrifice
and broke free from her shackles.

01:03:18.044 --> 01:03:22.465
DEAR X

01:05:42.563 --> 01:05:44.565
