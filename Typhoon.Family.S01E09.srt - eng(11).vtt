TYPHOON FAMILY

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:57.265
Ms. Oh!

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:03.730
-Mr. Go!
-Mr. Go!

00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:06.316
-My gosh, Mr. Go!
-Mr. Go!

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:07.817
-Mr. Go!
-Okay.

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.736
-What do we do?
-Okay.

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:11.571
-We get it.
-Ms. Oh! Please help…

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:12.864
Don't give up on me!

00:01:12.947 --> 00:01:14.407
-Let's go!
-Help me!

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:15.825
-Let's go!
-Wait…

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.452
I'm innocent!

00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:19.245
-Mr. Go…
-I'm not guilty!

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:56.324
Man, why are the roaches here so big?

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:03.998
-Do we have the number?
-Yes, I had it written down.

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:04.916
Where is it?

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:06.126
KOREAN EMBASSY

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:07.710
-Look, here.
-Is this it?

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.433
Hello, this is the Korean Embassy
in Thailand. How can I help you?

00:02:22.517 --> 00:02:26.187
Hello, we are a company
called Typhoon Trading from Korea.

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:28.940
One of my staff
is being held at the detention center.

00:02:29.023 --> 00:02:31.651
Okay, what was the reason
for their detention?

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.114
I hear it's for bribery,
but the sum was almost nothing.

00:02:36.197 --> 00:02:37.782
Did you bribe an official?

00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:41.536
I understand, but it's just $50.

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:44.372
Please contact the embassy
only in urgent situations.

00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:47.292
Yes, that's exactly
the kind of situation we're in.

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:50.295
If it was just $50,
they'll be released soon.

00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:51.504
A criminal offence…

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:55.758
Why did you hang up?

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.051
What did they say?

00:02:57.635 --> 00:03:00.054
-The cold hard truth.
-What?

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:09.939
Oh, gosh.

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:38.301
I shouldn't have given him that money.

00:03:50.813 --> 00:03:57.779
WE ARE OPEN

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:03.910
About my uncle.

00:04:04.702 --> 00:04:06.037
He's bald and bold.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.583
Can you believe he filled half that bag
with his care package for Ma-yong?

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:13.336
Mind you, that's a huge suitcase
expats use to travel.

00:04:18.716 --> 00:04:20.468
I'm back at my old company.

00:04:20.551 --> 00:04:21.761
I'm really determined…

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:25.056
to give it my all this time.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.643
So, don't you worry about me.

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:30.311
Okay, then.

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:35.525
I'll get going now.

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:38.528
What is it?

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:45.410
I can't believe it. Not again.

00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:46.536
Take it.

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:49.205
You'll have to treat Ma-yong
to a meal or something.

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.790
That's how you win goodwill.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.882
This is the first US dollar bill
I've ever held in my hand.

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:03.219
Thanks to you, son.

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:13.730
SHOE REPAIR SPECIALIST
OPEN DAILY FROM 7:00 A.M. TO 6:00 P.M.

00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:18.776
That bill meant so much to me.

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:24.157
You must be Korean.

00:05:24.782 --> 00:05:26.617
What was that?

00:05:27.618 --> 00:05:33.708
I worked in Korea for four years
in Gwangju, Gyeonggi-do.

00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:35.710
You seem like an upstanding guy.

00:05:35.793 --> 00:05:37.462
How did you end up here?

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:39.922
Well, I'm in for bribery.

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:41.466
You bribed someone?

00:05:43.092 --> 00:05:47.680
-Who?
-A customs officer at Lamchaya Port.

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:51.726
By the way, how old are you
to talk so casually to me?

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:54.645
I'm 48 years old. I'm old enough.

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.483
A customs officer at Lamchaya Port.

00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:07.742
What did he just say?

00:06:07.825 --> 00:06:11.162
-There will be a trial early tomorrow.
-A trial? All right.

00:06:11.245 --> 00:06:14.582
-It's for those who bribed a small amount.
-A small amount. Got it.

00:06:14.665 --> 00:06:17.376
As in any payments under $200.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.629
Under $200? Of course, I should've known.

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:24.509
It made no sense
to get dragged here for chump change.

00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:26.260
I'll be released tomorrow then.

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:31.682
What's your name? My name is Go Ma-jin.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:35.103
I'm Somchai. Somchai Saroon.

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:37.855
Somchai? Your name reminds me of som tam.

00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:42.777
Hang in there, all right?

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.614
I like your style.

00:06:46.697 --> 00:06:48.658
You think I've got style?

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:51.786
I guess you like my jacket.
This is my everyday look.

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:53.079
Anyway, it's a pleasure.

00:06:54.163 --> 00:06:58.167
Things will turn around,
so don't ever lose your spirit.

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:00.419
I can rest easy now.

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:03.631
I'm going to sleep.

00:07:03.714 --> 00:07:06.425
Jeez.

00:07:08.052 --> 00:07:09.345
I'm getting out.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:11.931
Gosh.

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:13.599
Tomorrow?

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:14.851
Thank goodness.

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:17.770
The newly elected governor
made a thorough sweep

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:21.149
to stamp out corruption
in the local government.

00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:24.777
Still, any bribe under 10,000 baht
is seen as a misdemeanor

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:26.696
and can receive a summary judgment.

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:29.031
He'll likely be released
with a fine at most.

00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:32.076
How much would the fine be?

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.830
Around 100,000 baht,
so about 3,000,000 won.

00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:40.084
By the way,

00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:44.630
what about the meeting with Nihakham Group
as our potential client?

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:48.676
I don't think you can
make a comeback from today's mishap.

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:49.635
-What?
-What?

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:53.598
You see, this incident made the headlines
of every newspaper and news show.

00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:56.392
What's more, Chairman Nihakham
is a stickler for rules.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.228
Oh, dear.

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:02.398
The whole thing has turned
into a pain in the neck, hasn't it?

00:08:09.947 --> 00:08:11.282
It's not so dire.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.911
Once Mr. Go is released
and we get our goods,

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:17.371
we can sell them, right?

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:20.917
-Bangkok has six million residents!
-That's true.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.502
We can sell our goods.

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:28.216
Are you okay?

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:30.885
Goodness.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:35.890
I'd say you seem pretty agitated.

00:08:35.973 --> 00:08:36.807
What?

00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:39.310
No, it was nothing. You can sit back down.

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:44.774
-Come on, it's hard to look up at you.
-Calm down and take a seat, Mr. Kang.

00:08:48.986 --> 00:08:50.196
Hey, I got it!

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:52.657
Five times one is five

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.283
Five times two is ten

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:55.618
Attaboy. Keep it going.

00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:57.370
Five times three is fifteen

00:08:57.453 --> 00:08:59.038
Five times four is twenty

00:09:00.414 --> 00:09:01.582
Five times five is…

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:04.293
What's five times five?

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:05.836
Five times five…

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.463
Five times five is 35!

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.382
From the top.

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:16.722
I thought the department store
doesn't open today.

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.767
Has your older sister given you a call…

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:20.851
I guess she hasn't.

00:09:24.605 --> 00:09:25.523
Well…

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:30.820
This is… You know, take them.

00:09:31.487 --> 00:09:33.864
What was that? I didn't catch that at all.

00:09:43.332 --> 00:09:45.751
-What are those?
-A present for me.

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:49.046
-Let me do it, ma'am.
-What?

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:51.382
Thanks.

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:56.053
Why did you bring out
the heavy comforters for winter?

00:09:56.137 --> 00:10:00.725
They're cotton-filled comforters
to keep my grandchildren warm.

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:07.440
I'm sure I still have a long time
to stay on this earth,

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.152
but I always feel like
I'm on a tight schedule.

00:10:13.195 --> 00:10:14.530
There we go.

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:15.948
Let's start.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:25.041
MOMO'S PUB

00:10:26.083 --> 00:10:27.084
Come on in.

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.091
Welcome.

00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:44.685
Here. Please take a seat.

00:10:56.238 --> 00:10:57.573
I brought a lunchbox.

00:11:02.703 --> 00:11:04.163
I've never done this before.

00:11:09.251 --> 00:11:11.796
-Is this for me?
-You can have it all.

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:14.507
Thank you.

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:21.138
The place looks different during the day.

00:11:23.057 --> 00:11:25.267
Didn't you say you run the place
with your mother?

00:11:25.976 --> 00:11:28.354
My dear Ms. Kim Eul-nyeo owns this place,

00:11:31.148 --> 00:11:32.900
but she's been away often lately.

00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:35.611
I guess she's busy.

00:11:36.445 --> 00:11:37.530
I can't say.

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:40.825
-How long do you work daily?
-Me?

00:11:41.784 --> 00:11:43.661
We keep the place open for ten hours.

00:11:43.744 --> 00:11:47.456
With ingredient prep and cleaning,
I work about 12 to 13 hours.

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:51.794
Business hasn't been so great,
so I might have to pick up other jobs.

00:11:52.753 --> 00:11:54.547
-Other jobs?
-Yes.

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:59.927
By the way, with a business of this size,
doesn't that mean the owner is well-off?

00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:03.597
Since this is your mother's place,
you're her heir.

00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:06.600
Hey, you're rich, Nam-mo.

00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:13.524
My dear Mi-ho, you'll probably swoon
if you meet an actually rich person.

00:12:13.607 --> 00:12:14.733
Don't be silly.

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:18.028
I've met plenty of rich people!

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:20.156
Really?

00:12:21.532 --> 00:12:22.616
You know what?

00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:24.785
You're so pretty.

00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:28.205
Give me a second.
I'll whip up a tasty snack.

00:12:34.712 --> 00:12:36.255
Where are his suitcases?

00:12:38.716 --> 00:12:41.635
Let's get him some clothes to change into
after his release tomorrow.

00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:44.388
He only had an undershirt
underneath the jacket.

00:12:44.472 --> 00:12:45.473
Okay.

00:12:47.057 --> 00:12:50.811
Hey, the collar is all stretched.

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:53.230
-That even has a hole.
-That too.

00:12:57.026 --> 00:12:58.986
Jeez, Mr. Go enjoyed a snack all alone.

00:12:59.069 --> 00:13:01.197
SPICY TUNA

00:13:04.867 --> 00:13:05.993
Mr. Kang.

00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:08.204
Look.

00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:12.583
KIMCHI RAMYUN, NEMO RAMYUN,
BRAVO TUNA, SPICY TUNA

00:13:12.666 --> 00:13:14.710
He packed more to share with us.

00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:18.714
He brought three items each.

00:13:21.342 --> 00:13:22.760
MIN BURI CRIMINAL COURT
MIN BURI CIVIL COURT

00:13:22.843 --> 00:13:23.719
I don't get it.

00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:27.014
-Why can't we go in?
-Be patient, Mr. Kang.

00:13:27.097 --> 00:13:29.058
We're looking into it.

00:13:29.141 --> 00:13:30.935
Hey, there's Ha-neul.

00:13:31.018 --> 00:13:32.394
Get over here.

00:13:32.478 --> 00:13:34.480
-Be careful.
-Let's see.

00:13:37.983 --> 00:13:39.235
"Ten thousand dollars"?

00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:42.446
It says you bribed $10,000, not $50.

00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:44.657
What? They think Mr. Go did that?

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.326
Wait, $10,000 equals over 15 million won.

00:13:47.409 --> 00:13:48.327
I don't get it, either.

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:51.080
That must be why Ma-jin
wasn't included in the trial.

00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:53.874
How did $50 turn into $10,000, anyway?

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.669
Look, the officer's testimony
is right here.

00:13:57.253 --> 00:14:00.214
"At 6:00 p.m. on April 27th,

00:14:00.297 --> 00:14:03.300
a Korean man gave me 10,000 dollars
on my way home after work."

00:14:03.384 --> 00:14:05.261
After work? But we were there in daytime.

00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:08.222
I saw it happen. This is not right.

00:14:08.305 --> 00:14:11.225
I'm telling you,
I saw him give the 50 dollars.

00:14:11.308 --> 00:14:13.686
This must be why Ma-jin
is getting a full trial.

00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:15.646
Ha-neul, when's his trial?

00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:18.566
It says "the day after tomorrow."

00:14:18.649 --> 00:14:20.109
Look, Mr. Kang.

00:14:20.192 --> 00:14:23.529
This must be why
we haven't received your helmets.

00:14:23.612 --> 00:14:26.615
The authorities have seized them
instead of clearing them.

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:27.950
What happens then?

00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:30.327
If you fail to explain,
they'll throw them out right away.

00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:32.079
They'll destroy them.

00:14:33.163 --> 00:14:36.375
-That means we have 48 hours.
-Why do you keep speaking English?

00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:39.128
So, what now? We've got to find a way out.

00:14:39.211 --> 00:14:41.297
Everything's gone downhill.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.840
Wait, that's Mr. Go's jacket.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.262
Where did you get this jacket?

00:14:55.102 --> 00:14:57.146
I'm asking where you got this jacket.

00:15:00.482 --> 00:15:02.109
I don't know any Korean guy.

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:07.364
-Hey!
-Stop!

00:15:07.448 --> 00:15:08.657
Hold on. Let me explain.

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:12.202
Something's fishy.
How did he know Mr. Go is a Korean?

00:15:12.286 --> 00:15:14.163
-Hey, no, you're a foreigner.
-Okay!

00:15:16.457 --> 00:15:17.791
-All right, but--
-Stop it!

00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:18.876
Listen, Mr. Kang.

00:15:30.095 --> 00:15:32.097
"Friends?" They've come to see me?

00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:36.018
I'm too ashamed to face them.

00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:39.688
What's going on with the helmets?

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:41.231
Hang on.

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:57.289
For just one minute.
Just for a second or one minute.

00:16:11.053 --> 00:16:14.598
What do we do
if Mr. Go ends up serving time?

00:16:16.183 --> 00:16:19.645
-I hear life in prison is brutal here.
-Let's wait it out, Mr. Kang.

00:16:19.728 --> 00:16:21.480
-Let's not go there just yet.
-Excuse me.

00:16:24.024 --> 00:16:25.234
Here, sir.

00:16:27.778 --> 00:16:28.821
Thank you.

00:16:32.116 --> 00:16:33.367
-Let's go.
-Hey, Mr. Kang.

00:16:43.127 --> 00:16:44.837
-Mr. Go!
-Where is he?

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.796
Where is he?

00:16:45.879 --> 00:16:47.464
-Hey, Mr. Go!
-There he is.

00:16:47.548 --> 00:16:48.757
-Where?
-Over there. Mr. Go!

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:51.468
Mr. Go! We're over here!

00:16:51.552 --> 00:16:53.012
-We're here.
-Mr. Go!

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:56.098
-Mr. Go!
-We're right here, Mr. Go!

00:16:56.181 --> 00:16:58.767
-Over here, Mr. Go!
-Ms. Oh!

00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:00.144
Mr. Kang!

00:17:00.227 --> 00:17:01.645
Mr. Go!

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:06.108
Where's your top?
I mean, what happened to your jacket?

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:07.901
I don't know. Someone must've stolen it.

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:10.696
I look awful, don't I?

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:14.700
No, you don't.

00:17:15.325 --> 00:17:17.661
You look like your usual self.
You seem fine.

00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:21.165
Hang in there, Mr. Go.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.168
Have you had anything to eat?

00:17:24.752 --> 00:17:26.670
I'm going to eat when I get released!

00:17:32.593 --> 00:17:35.929
We've only got five minutes left.
Reassure him or something, Mr. Kang.

00:17:36.013 --> 00:17:37.097
Mr. Go!

00:17:39.183 --> 00:17:40.726
We'll get you out of there!

00:17:42.352 --> 00:17:43.729
Don't worry about a thing.

00:17:45.189 --> 00:17:46.565
What about the deal?

00:17:46.648 --> 00:17:48.025
Don't stress about it!

00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:53.155
It's all going to be fine.

00:17:53.781 --> 00:17:55.491
Don't you worry about me.

00:17:55.574 --> 00:17:57.826
I served in the Marines, dang it!

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.746
All right. Don't you worry about us.

00:18:04.291 --> 00:18:05.959
We'll get you out no matter what.

00:18:06.043 --> 00:18:08.754
-I'll be fine here.
-Make sure to eat, okay?

00:18:08.837 --> 00:18:10.923
Don't forget to feed yourself!

00:18:11.006 --> 00:18:13.175
-Keep your belly full, okay?
-I'll be fine!

00:18:13.258 --> 00:18:14.426
Off you go.

00:18:16.804 --> 00:18:18.138
Hey, Mi-seon!

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.681
Ms. Oh!

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:21.767
-Why does he want me?
-Let's get over there.

00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:23.936
-I'm right here, Mr. Go.
-Ms. Oh!

00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:25.562
-What's wrong?
-Mi-seon!

00:18:25.646 --> 00:18:26.522
I'm here, Mr. Go.

00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:28.232
-Pick it up!
-Wait.

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:32.194
No! Off you go.

00:18:38.158 --> 00:18:39.910
I got it. Don't worry.

00:18:39.993 --> 00:18:41.120
All right. See you.

00:18:42.454 --> 00:18:45.874
Make sure to eat, okay?
Don't skip a meal. Sit tight.

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.293
-I'll keep this safe.
-Okay.

00:18:48.377 --> 00:18:50.003
Make sure to eat, Mr. Go.

00:18:50.087 --> 00:18:51.130
Okay.

00:18:51.213 --> 00:18:53.048
-Okay.
-Eat well!

00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:54.424
-Get out!
-Hang in there!

00:19:06.854 --> 00:19:09.314
MANAGE OUR CLIENTS, SALES
AND INVENTORY - YOUR SENIOR COLLEAGUE

00:19:14.695 --> 00:19:16.029
Manage…

00:19:18.615 --> 00:19:21.451
our clients, sales and inventory.

00:19:23.245 --> 00:19:24.371
Your senior colleague.

00:19:28.083 --> 00:19:30.669
"Clients, sales and inventory."

00:19:31.712 --> 00:19:34.506
Those are the basics of sales.

00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:36.675
The basics of sales?

00:19:43.432 --> 00:19:45.184
Does it make you that happy?

00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:49.730
It says "your senior colleague," Mr. Kang.

00:19:51.982 --> 00:19:55.068
I now have a colleague,
not just someone who bosses me around.

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.043
Ms. Oh.

00:20:11.585 --> 00:20:13.337
What are the basics of being a CEO?

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.755
Excuse me?

00:20:14.838 --> 00:20:18.592
You now have
the three basic items to manage.

00:20:19.593 --> 00:20:20.552
But for me,

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:23.764
I don't know what I should manage.

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:30.562
What would my father tell me to protect?

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:38.028
The company, of course.

00:20:43.742 --> 00:20:44.952
Mr. Kang!

00:20:45.035 --> 00:20:46.620
What about the deal?

00:20:46.703 --> 00:20:47.996
Don't stress about it!

00:20:51.541 --> 00:20:53.252
Don't you worry about me.

00:20:53.335 --> 00:20:56.213
I served in the Marines, dang it!

00:20:58.715 --> 00:20:59.841
Take care then.

00:21:03.804 --> 00:21:10.477
EPISODE 9
WALKING TO THE SKY

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:15.899
Mr. Go!

00:21:15.983 --> 00:21:19.820
Don't forget to feed yourself!
Keep your belly full, okay?

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.907
Are we still knee deep in the Korean War?
Why is she so hung up on food?

00:21:23.991 --> 00:21:25.367
Mr. Go!

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.286
We'll get you out of there!

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:30.289
Don't worry about a thing.

00:21:30.872 --> 00:21:32.874
That's the least I can do here.

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:34.543
I'm the one who messed up.

00:21:42.843 --> 00:21:46.471
You two are pretty chummy, aren't you?

00:21:56.148 --> 00:21:57.941
I get it, but let me share.

00:22:07.242 --> 00:22:09.703
Excuse me. Coming through.

00:22:09.786 --> 00:22:11.371
-Sorry.
-Come help me out later.

00:22:11.455 --> 00:22:13.081
Of course. I'll see you soon!

00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:15.042
Excuse me. Coming through.

00:22:15.125 --> 00:22:16.960
Oh, dear. Sorry about that.

00:22:17.044 --> 00:22:18.670
Please excuse me.

00:22:20.088 --> 00:22:21.381
Coming through.

00:22:21.465 --> 00:22:22.507
Hello, sir.

00:22:22.591 --> 00:22:24.259
-Hey, keep it up.
-Thank you.

00:22:57.459 --> 00:22:58.835
Excuse me. Coming through.

00:23:29.783 --> 00:23:31.201
Hey.

00:23:31.284 --> 00:23:32.661
I'm fine.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.874
All newbies flounder on their first day.
The work itself isn't hard.

00:23:37.958 --> 00:23:39.876
Everybody else works for a living too.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.628
Go easy, will you?

00:23:41.711 --> 00:23:43.588
Okay. I'll page you when I clock out.

00:23:43.672 --> 00:23:45.507
All right. Make sure to do that.

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.135
Mi-ho. Don't you worry about me.

00:23:48.218 --> 00:23:50.554
Me, worried? You got it all wrong.

00:23:51.972 --> 00:23:54.349
Sure. Just don't push yourself too far.

00:23:55.892 --> 00:23:57.936
All right. See you.

00:23:58.687 --> 00:23:59.688
Kisses.

00:24:06.153 --> 00:24:07.154
Hey, new guy.

00:24:07.237 --> 00:24:09.489
-Did you say you can ride a motorcycle?
-Yes.

00:24:09.573 --> 00:24:11.449
Do a quick delivery for me.

00:24:11.533 --> 00:24:12.701
Sure.

00:24:15.036 --> 00:24:17.289
Are you okay?

00:24:17.372 --> 00:24:19.875
Give me my money back.

00:24:22.586 --> 00:24:25.213
Who did this? What the hell is this?

00:24:25.297 --> 00:24:27.799
-What on earth…
-What a bunch of rascals.

00:24:27.883 --> 00:24:31.469
-I invested a heavy sum. What do I do now?
-Let's leave now.

00:24:33.305 --> 00:24:34.347
What do I do?

00:24:35.473 --> 00:24:37.142
How could this have happened?

00:24:37.225 --> 00:24:39.978
-I'm penniless now.
-I can't believe this.

00:24:41.396 --> 00:24:43.565
What do I do about the lost money?

00:24:44.191 --> 00:24:48.028
That money was my lifeline!

00:24:48.111 --> 00:24:50.989
Oh, dear. We're done for.

00:24:51.072 --> 00:24:54.284
-Get over here quickly.
-What I wouldn't do to those crooks!

00:24:54.367 --> 00:24:57.996
How could the heavens allow this?
Where would these bastards be holed up?

00:24:58.079 --> 00:25:02.209
-They took off with everything.
-That money was everything to me.

00:25:02.292 --> 00:25:06.129
How dare you take my precious money,
you rotten bastards?

00:25:08.048 --> 00:25:09.090
Those bastards…

00:25:09.174 --> 00:25:10.759
Those bastards…

00:25:10.842 --> 00:25:14.012
-How am I supposed to go on?
-What…

00:25:14.554 --> 00:25:17.682
My heart is breaking.
What should I do now?

00:25:19.601 --> 00:25:24.231
-Give me my money back.
-Oh, all my money…

00:25:29.653 --> 00:25:31.488
This can't be true!

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:46.670
-Drink some.
-I will.

00:26:18.868 --> 00:26:20.996
You offered my company
an invaluable opportunity.

00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:25.959
My foolishness almost caused
you and your company harm.

00:26:26.042 --> 00:26:27.377
My sincerest apologies.

00:26:37.262 --> 00:26:40.682
I'm glad you know of your foolishness.

00:26:41.516 --> 00:26:43.018
But I don't need your apology.

00:26:44.185 --> 00:26:46.229
In business,

00:26:46.313 --> 00:26:49.024
what you need is
not an apology, but money.

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:49.334
It's much better
to hold onto feces than a fart.

00:27:53.254 --> 00:27:55.965
The saying that it's better to be
holding onto something substantial,

00:27:56.049 --> 00:27:57.509
even if it may seem useless.

00:27:59.052 --> 00:28:00.804
I wanted to ask you something.

00:28:00.887 --> 00:28:02.305
Why Thailand?

00:28:06.184 --> 00:28:09.896
I've always wondered if a quality product
would have a universal appeal.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.066
Price concerns aside,
if the helmets sell here,

00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:15.652
I can look forward to future opportunities
in the Thai market.

00:28:30.667 --> 00:28:33.336
However, I can't work with a company
that's caused problems.

00:28:50.603 --> 00:28:51.813
Thanks for your efforts.

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:01.531
Tae-poong.

00:29:08.121 --> 00:29:09.456
Well, no.

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:06.137
Forget about opportunities and insights.
We're here to sell the helmets.

00:30:06.221 --> 00:30:08.932
-Go ask her to take some off our hands.
-What?

00:30:09.015 --> 00:30:13.520
It looks like she has a soft spot for you.
Go on and put your skills to good use.

00:30:13.603 --> 00:30:15.814
-My skills?
-You know what I'm talking about.

00:30:15.897 --> 00:30:18.942
Tell her she's pretty
and write "wish coupon" on her palm.

00:30:19.025 --> 00:30:21.778
Go and chat with her
before she leaves for her meal.

00:30:21.861 --> 00:30:24.322
This is it. She's on her way.
Where are you going?

00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:29.536
Come on, why are you leaving?

00:30:31.788 --> 00:30:34.499
-Get in here already.
-But still…

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:38.753
Fine.

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:49.347
I don't go around
telling people they're pretty.

00:30:57.897 --> 00:31:00.024
There we go. One, two.

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:05.071
What's that?

00:31:05.738 --> 00:31:07.115
-Is it a gift for me?
-Yes.

00:31:07.198 --> 00:31:09.993
Inside are items from the US
for potential future projects.

00:31:10.076 --> 00:31:11.119
Really?

00:31:14.664 --> 00:31:17.041
Hang on, who's Katherine Kang?

00:31:17.125 --> 00:31:19.127
Oh, that's Aunt Kang Suk-ja in LA.

00:31:26.175 --> 00:31:27.260
I can't wait.

00:31:32.974 --> 00:31:35.476
What's this? Does she take me
for a common peddler?

00:31:39.188 --> 00:31:42.567
Does she seriously
expect me to sell these?

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:43.943
All this common stuff?

00:31:45.528 --> 00:31:46.613
I can't believe this.

00:31:46.696 --> 00:31:48.114
What even is this mess?

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.327
A shirt.

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:54.412
How unsophisticated.

00:31:57.206 --> 00:31:58.207
Jeez.

00:31:59.208 --> 00:32:02.795
That aside, why did that idiot,
Tae-poong, fly to Thailand?

00:32:02.879 --> 00:32:06.507
Oh, he went to Thailand
to export Korean helmets.

00:32:08.635 --> 00:32:10.678
He sure loves safety gear and shit.

00:32:13.306 --> 00:32:14.849
Enough about him.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.768
What should I do?

00:32:18.478 --> 00:32:20.396
Why won't my dad make any investments?

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:24.400
Why did he have to kick up the dust
about buying those expensive ships?

00:32:24.484 --> 00:32:27.779
He drives me insane.

00:32:32.367 --> 00:32:34.285
Wait, Mr. Ha.

00:32:36.704 --> 00:32:39.666
What does my dad have
against Typhoon Trading?

00:32:42.126 --> 00:32:43.127
As for me,

00:32:43.211 --> 00:32:47.006
I want Tae-poong ruined for getting
in my way ever since we were eight.

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:49.008
I just don't understand it.

00:32:49.092 --> 00:32:50.218
Don't you find it odd?

00:32:52.512 --> 00:32:54.305
The company didn't have much.

00:32:56.683 --> 00:33:01.729
I wouldn't dare to presume
what your father might be thinking,

00:33:03.356 --> 00:33:05.233
but he has no interest
in such a trifling company.

00:33:07.068 --> 00:33:08.945
Goodness, it's late.
I should return to my office.

Your son has asked me
about the Typhoon Trading business.

Hyun-jun doesn't need to know, does he?

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.195
-Understood.
-Dad!

00:33:53.114 --> 00:33:55.158
I found it, Dad.

00:33:55.241 --> 00:33:56.826
I did it.

00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:02.540
Dad.

00:34:03.916 --> 00:34:05.752
Look.

00:34:06.461 --> 00:34:08.546
Why don't I try selling this?

00:34:15.928 --> 00:34:18.014
What do you think? Isn't it awesome?

00:34:20.475 --> 00:34:24.353
Have you given a thought
to how you would sell it?

00:34:24.437 --> 00:34:26.731
Why would I bother with that?

00:34:27.523 --> 00:34:30.693
You brought in eggheads
and pay them a fortune to sort that out.

00:34:31.277 --> 00:34:33.946
Even so,
the final call is your responsibility.

I have no appetite.

Have you called your family?

No.

00:35:10.566 --> 00:35:11.526
You know,

00:35:12.485 --> 00:35:13.653
Tae-poong…

00:35:17.657 --> 00:35:20.201
Are we finally on a first-name basis?

00:35:22.703 --> 00:35:23.663
Unbelievable.

00:35:28.793 --> 00:35:30.044
Are you still mad?

I'm sorry.

00:35:37.677 --> 00:35:44.642
I was too focused on securing a deal
as a sales representative.

00:35:47.937 --> 00:35:51.774
I wish you'd pay more attention
to how I'd feel.

00:35:56.529 --> 00:35:57.947
Wait a moment.

00:36:00.366 --> 00:36:01.576
Hello.

00:36:01.659 --> 00:36:03.953
Could I have two watermelon smoothies?

00:36:04.036 --> 00:36:05.913
Sure, just a moment.

00:36:11.752 --> 00:36:12.920
Here, drink this.

00:36:15.381 --> 00:36:18.467
This is watermelon juice.

00:36:22.471 --> 00:36:23.514
It's sweet.

00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:30.396
Even when we're worried sick,
we shouldn't skip a meal.

00:36:31.189 --> 00:36:32.732
Come on, I'm not worried sick.

00:36:42.241 --> 00:36:45.745
I didn't know you could make juice
out of watermelon.

00:36:45.828 --> 00:36:46.913
It's amazing.

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:54.670
Mi-ho loves watermelons.

00:36:58.633 --> 00:36:59.634
Do you miss her?

00:37:01.427 --> 00:37:04.513
You should give her a call.
Don't worry about the phone bill.

00:37:07.266 --> 00:37:08.476
Tell you what.

00:37:10.728 --> 00:37:14.232
I've never stayed apart
from my family before.

00:37:16.317 --> 00:37:19.445
So, I miss Beom dearly
and wonder how Mi-ho is doing.

00:37:19.528 --> 00:37:22.073
My grandmother has been on my mind too.

00:37:25.034 --> 00:37:26.702
But I actually find this freeing.

00:37:29.538 --> 00:37:32.667
Now that I'm alone, I feel like
a weight has been lifted off my chest.

00:37:35.419 --> 00:37:37.755
The idea of a business trip
excited me as well.

00:37:38.714 --> 00:37:42.593
Maybe that's why I insisted on coming,
even when I knew Mr. Go hated it.

00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:50.601
I'm a terrible person, aren't I?

00:37:52.186 --> 00:37:56.565
Sure, you're awful. What a surprise.

00:38:01.028 --> 00:38:02.196
Still, I like it.

00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:05.408
When you're being mean.

00:38:05.992 --> 00:38:09.120
Think about it.
A person can't be good all the time.

00:38:10.746 --> 00:38:13.124
Anyone would think
someone is a nice person

00:38:13.207 --> 00:38:16.043
if they are good 70% of the time
and bad 30% of the time.

00:38:16.127 --> 00:38:18.963
But you're mean only 10% of the time,

00:38:20.423 --> 00:38:21.590
which was on this trip.

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:31.017
You think I'm a wimp, don't you?

00:38:36.022 --> 00:38:37.189
You are…

00:38:38.691 --> 00:38:39.984
brilliant.

00:38:42.111 --> 00:38:43.821
Out of all the people I've met,

00:38:45.573 --> 00:38:47.033
you're the coolest…

00:38:50.036 --> 00:38:52.496
and the prettiest.

00:38:55.458 --> 00:38:57.626
Aren't you lucky
to have me crushing on you?

00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:29.033
Don't you want to?

00:39:48.302 --> 00:39:49.553
Come on, Mr. Kang!

00:39:49.637 --> 00:39:50.888
You're being silly.

00:39:50.971 --> 00:39:55.017
This isn't the time for this.

00:39:59.063 --> 00:40:00.398
What are you objecting to?

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:03.401
Don't get so up close and personal.

00:40:04.819 --> 00:40:07.405
-Why not?
-I don't feel comfortable.

00:40:08.614 --> 00:40:09.990
You don't feel comfortable?

00:40:11.575 --> 00:40:15.454
At any rate,
Mr. Go is facing possible jail time.

00:40:15.538 --> 00:40:19.083
We shouldn't be wasting our time
on our personal matters.

00:40:19.166 --> 00:40:20.918
We've got a serious situation here.

00:40:34.014 --> 00:40:38.310
By the way, why do you think
the customs officer falsely accused Mr. Go

00:40:39.145 --> 00:40:40.980
of paying him $10,000?

00:40:41.856 --> 00:40:44.358
He must've wanted
to get someone else off the hook.

00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:48.237
Mr. Go's bribe was only about $50.

00:40:49.405 --> 00:40:53.492
Could the officer have lied to get the man
with Mr. Go's jacket released?

00:40:54.118 --> 00:40:56.579
We don't know
how he got hold of that jacket,

00:40:58.414 --> 00:41:00.666
but he must've pretended to be Mr. Go.

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:05.880
Mr. Go's trial is tomorrow.

00:41:06.714 --> 00:41:09.258
I'll have to secure the money
to pay his bail.

00:41:09.842 --> 00:41:11.677
Do we have enough funds, though?

00:41:12.511 --> 00:41:16.599
I've called colleagues in Korea
to gather what funds they can.

00:41:18.476 --> 00:41:21.687
Let's do all we can
to get him out on bail tomorrow.

00:41:24.106 --> 00:41:27.318
I should've done more to stop him
instead of taking photos.

00:41:31.363 --> 00:41:34.200
Tell me. Did you really hate it?

00:41:34.909 --> 00:41:35.826
Right, the photos!

00:41:39.038 --> 00:41:40.039
Come on!

00:41:46.045 --> 00:41:47.213
Here they are.

00:41:48.047 --> 00:41:50.174
You finished two rolls of film
in that short time?

00:41:50.257 --> 00:41:51.175
Three rolls, actually.

00:41:51.258 --> 00:41:53.928
Each only had 24 shots, anyway.
We need the photos for our trip report.

00:41:54.512 --> 00:41:58.015
I recorded pretty much
all the events of the day.

00:41:58.098 --> 00:41:59.558
Records remain while memories fade.

00:41:59.642 --> 00:42:01.560
Hey, that's a cool line.

00:42:02.478 --> 00:42:04.188
It's what your father used to say.

00:42:07.399 --> 00:42:09.485
I think I photographed the incident.
No, I'm sure of it.

00:42:09.568 --> 00:42:13.197
Mr. Go handed over the cigarette packs
and slipped the 50-dollar bill inside.

00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:23.165
I can't believe you took photos of that.

00:42:25.125 --> 00:42:26.460
Why did you do it, though?

00:42:27.336 --> 00:42:28.796
Because he went against the company code.

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:32.341
I see.

00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:37.221
Where can we go to get these developed?
We can't wait around until tomorrow.

00:42:37.304 --> 00:42:38.806
It's 9:30 p.m.

00:42:39.431 --> 00:42:43.102
Mr. Go's trial is at 11:00 a.m. and
the helmets will be scrapped at 4:00 p.m.

00:42:43.185 --> 00:42:45.479
We have to clear Mr. Go's name
before that, no matter what.

00:42:45.563 --> 00:42:47.439
Let's go look for a photo studio.

00:42:47.523 --> 00:42:49.608
-All right.
-Let's go.

00:43:00.828 --> 00:43:03.664
-Where should we go?
-Over there, I suppose?

00:43:10.004 --> 00:43:11.714
Hi. Hello.

00:43:11.797 --> 00:43:14.758
-Well, photo…
-Photo… Print.

00:43:17.052 --> 00:43:18.387
-Okay.
-Okay, thank you.

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.435
Like so…

00:43:25.603 --> 00:43:26.562
Oh, no.

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:31.066
-We've got films here. We want photos.
-Photo films.

00:43:31.817 --> 00:43:33.110
-Okay, thank you.
-Okay.

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:35.654
Gosh.

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:37.781
Where can we…

00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:50.127
I don't see anything.

00:43:52.755 --> 00:43:55.049
-Let's ask him and call it a day.
-Okay.

00:43:58.552 --> 00:44:00.429
-Hi. Hello.
-Hello.

00:44:06.185 --> 00:44:08.187
-Yes, photo and film.
-Oh, photo.

00:44:11.732 --> 00:44:13.984
-Saphan? Bridge.
-Yes.

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.197
-Is there a studio?
-Just across the bridge.

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:21.492
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

00:44:33.879 --> 00:44:35.172
Hey, look over there!

00:44:35.255 --> 00:44:36.882
It says "photo."

00:44:36.965 --> 00:44:38.592
-Film… Look inside.
-Okay.

00:44:38.676 --> 00:44:40.469
-Excuse me!
-Excuse me!

00:44:40.552 --> 00:44:42.221
-Hello?
-Is anyone there?

00:44:43.055 --> 00:44:44.765
-Please!
-Help me!

00:44:44.848 --> 00:44:47.309
-I'm in a rush! Hello?
-Hello? Is no one there?

00:44:53.816 --> 00:44:55.025
-Hello.
-No.

00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:56.318
-Thank you.
-Wrong again.

00:44:56.402 --> 00:44:58.153
Excuse me.

00:44:58.237 --> 00:44:59.905
-Please.
-Excuse me.

00:44:59.988 --> 00:45:01.073
Could you call the owner…

00:45:01.156 --> 00:45:02.825
-Photo…
-I guess she doesn't run the studio.

00:45:02.908 --> 00:45:04.743
-Dang, what do we do now?
-I'm losing my mind.

00:45:04.827 --> 00:45:06.328
Maybe it's time for us to give up.

00:45:06.412 --> 00:45:07.996
What can we do
when there are no photo studios?

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:12.084
We need to cause a scene
to have people call the studio owner.

00:45:13.127 --> 00:45:14.670
-Shall I kick down the door?
-What?

00:45:15.587 --> 00:45:17.131
-I'll do it.
-Hold on.

00:45:17.214 --> 00:45:19.091
Let's think of another way. Don't.

00:45:19.174 --> 00:45:21.218
They'll open the shop
if the police get here.

00:45:22.553 --> 00:45:24.096
Don't do it. Give me a second.

00:45:25.431 --> 00:45:27.307
This isn't the way. My gosh!

00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:29.852
Seriously? Wait!

00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:36.316
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.985
-Good evening.
-Could you open the door?

00:46:00.966 --> 00:46:03.969
How long will it take?

00:46:05.846 --> 00:46:07.973
-Three.
-Three hours?

00:46:08.056 --> 00:46:10.184
-Three hours?
-Three hours? Then…

00:46:10.267 --> 00:46:12.186
That would be 2 a.m.

00:46:12.269 --> 00:46:13.437
Will it be done by 2 a.m.?

00:46:20.986 --> 00:46:22.070
-What did he say?
-No idea.

00:46:32.372 --> 00:46:33.790
MAY 2ND, 1998

00:46:33.874 --> 00:46:35.083
We have to wait until then?

00:46:35.167 --> 00:46:37.127
A whopping three days? Three days?

00:46:37.211 --> 00:46:38.212
Three days?

00:46:38.295 --> 00:46:39.713
-Yes.
-No.

00:46:39.796 --> 00:46:41.215
No, no.

00:46:41.298 --> 00:46:44.343
One, two, three.

00:46:54.269 --> 00:46:55.145
Forget it!

00:46:55.812 --> 00:46:59.858
-Wait, wait.
-Hang on.

00:46:59.942 --> 00:47:01.527
Okay.

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:03.403
Okay. So…

00:47:04.321 --> 00:47:05.405
How much do you want?

00:47:16.667 --> 00:47:17.876
We'll offer…

00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:19.962
-There. 1,000 baht.
-Okay.

00:47:20.796 --> 00:47:22.464
Thousand. 1,000 baht.

00:47:33.433 --> 00:47:35.018
What? He struck off a day?

00:47:38.272 --> 00:47:39.940
-There.
-Two thousand.

00:47:45.153 --> 00:47:46.446
I can't believe this. So?

00:47:50.492 --> 00:47:52.452
-Still not satisfied?
-Go, go, go, go.

00:47:52.995 --> 00:47:54.454
He's driving me crazy.

00:47:59.209 --> 00:48:01.920
What are you doing, Ms. Oh?
No, I can't lose this!

00:48:02.588 --> 00:48:04.172
How come? Was it your father's?

00:48:04.756 --> 00:48:06.008
I only brought one watch.

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:09.595
Take it off.
You know we haven't got time for this.

00:48:09.678 --> 00:48:11.013
-But it's…
-Hurry!

00:48:11.096 --> 00:48:13.807
Do we have a deal?
You can have this on top of 3,000 baht.

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:14.808
-Deal?
-Sure.

00:48:19.771 --> 00:48:20.939
All right, sure.

00:48:22.608 --> 00:48:23.567
Gosh, seriously?

00:48:26.778 --> 00:48:28.614
What's this? Has the power gone out?

00:48:29.239 --> 00:48:31.241
He turned the lights off
to get the photos developed.

00:48:32.117 --> 00:48:33.160
Oh, right.

00:48:35.203 --> 00:48:36.705
We're on the right track then.

00:48:40.834 --> 00:48:42.085
What time is it, anyway?

00:48:42.836 --> 00:48:44.338
I don't have my watch with me.

00:49:11.031 --> 00:49:12.949
BELLUA DEPARTMENT STORE

00:49:13.033 --> 00:49:16.453
CLEARANCE SALE

00:49:31.802 --> 00:49:33.303
I guess he's not coming today.

00:49:57.244 --> 00:49:58.787
Hey, you're here.

00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:04.251
My shift ended later than usual.

00:50:04.876 --> 00:50:07.045
I couldn't reach the department store
in time, so I came here.

00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:09.005
Sorry.

00:50:09.673 --> 00:50:11.216
Let's go. I'll walk you home.

00:50:12.217 --> 00:50:13.135
Okay.

00:50:43.081 --> 00:50:44.082
We're here already.

00:50:46.752 --> 00:50:48.754
You must be tired. Go in and rest.

00:50:56.094 --> 00:50:57.095
Hey.

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:04.060
-Yeah?
-What's the matter?

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:07.981
What's going on?

00:51:10.525 --> 00:51:12.444
Mi-ho, it's just that…

00:51:14.029 --> 00:51:16.448
This won't do.
Let me take a few more steps back.

00:51:22.579 --> 00:51:25.207
My family had to close down the pub today.

00:51:26.374 --> 00:51:28.585
Things somehow turned out that way.

00:51:29.294 --> 00:51:31.046
We had to put our place on sale…

00:51:35.717 --> 00:51:38.303
We'll probably have to crash
with my aunt for the time being.

00:51:40.013 --> 00:51:40.847
And?

00:51:41.681 --> 00:51:42.557
I just thought

00:51:43.475 --> 00:51:44.851
I should tell you.

00:51:46.269 --> 00:51:49.773
You're not supposed to keep a secret
from the person you're seeing.

00:51:56.404 --> 00:51:58.532
And why did you step away to tell me that?

00:52:01.493 --> 00:52:02.661
I didn't want my sorrow

00:52:04.788 --> 00:52:05.956
to taint you.

00:52:27.394 --> 00:52:28.395
You dummy.

00:52:29.479 --> 00:52:30.939
Cut out the melodrama.

00:52:31.022 --> 00:52:32.774
Just tell me it's rough for you.

00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:36.945
Be frank and ask me to stay by your side.

00:52:38.154 --> 00:52:39.155
Okay.

00:53:22.282 --> 00:53:23.450
Look at these.

00:53:23.533 --> 00:53:25.160
-Hey, we've got our photos.
-Yeah.

00:53:26.536 --> 00:53:27.537
Thank goodness.

00:53:27.621 --> 00:53:29.664
SAWADDEE

00:53:30.624 --> 00:53:32.500
They'll be ready soon.

00:53:33.168 --> 00:53:36.254
Meet me at the court.
I'll go get the money and the documents.

00:53:36.338 --> 00:53:37.297
The money?

00:53:38.214 --> 00:53:40.467
We don't know
how much the fine will be, so…

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:42.177
-Okay.
-Be careful on your way, all right?

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:44.512
-Sure. See you later.
-Okay.

00:55:22.777 --> 00:55:23.737
Thank you.

00:55:31.619 --> 00:55:33.997
MIN BURI CRIMINAL COURT
MIN BURI CIVIL COURT

00:55:40.253 --> 00:55:42.088
Hey, there comes Ma-jin.

00:55:48.928 --> 00:55:50.472
He looks better than I hoped.

00:56:16.247 --> 00:56:17.832
By the way, where is Ms. Oh?

00:56:19.375 --> 00:56:21.002
She should be here by now.

00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:29.511
All rise.

00:56:40.688 --> 00:56:42.023
You can sit back down now.

00:57:00.792 --> 00:57:03.002
What do I do? Oh, no!

00:57:04.629 --> 00:57:06.172
What should I do now?

00:57:07.132 --> 00:57:09.175
Damn, you've got to be kidding me.

00:57:16.683 --> 00:57:19.352
I deeply regret that,
as a foreign national,

00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:23.106
you have attempted
to undermine the laws of this country.

00:57:23.648 --> 00:57:27.277
While there is some dispute
regarding the amount of the bribe,

00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:32.991
The ruling is based on the $10,000
stated in the witness's testimony.

00:57:33.074 --> 00:57:34.534
So…

00:57:37.662 --> 00:57:38.913
I'll talk to her.

00:57:46.754 --> 00:57:48.256
"Evidence," so proof?

00:57:48.339 --> 00:57:50.508
I don't have such a big sum…

00:57:50.592 --> 00:57:53.344
Please ask her how I'm supposed
to prove that I'm broke.

00:57:53.428 --> 00:57:55.513
Then, I will deliver the verdict.

00:57:56.347 --> 00:57:57.390
We have evidence!

00:58:18.536 --> 00:58:19.621
Could you interpret for me?

00:58:23.625 --> 00:58:28.505
Even the total price of the helmets
we brought is nowhere near $10,000.

00:58:29.422 --> 00:58:31.549
Why would we use that much for a bribe?

00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:40.266
I also brought

00:58:41.976 --> 00:58:45.855
the import declaration form
and the quotation we've sent

00:58:45.939 --> 00:58:47.273
the Nihakham Group by fax.

00:58:47.357 --> 00:58:48.191
What's more,

00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:50.652
I have the purchase agreement.

00:59:12.799 --> 00:59:14.467
You have a point.

00:59:15.218 --> 00:59:19.222
But… this is insufficient
as direct evidence.

00:59:19.973 --> 00:59:22.559
You may have had…

00:59:22.642 --> 00:59:26.521
I think she's saying that the documents
don't qualify as conclusive proof.

00:59:32.485 --> 00:59:33.361
More… So…

00:59:34.362 --> 00:59:35.446
Well…

00:59:38.575 --> 00:59:39.742
We…

00:59:40.743 --> 00:59:41.911
How should I say this…

00:59:56.009 --> 00:59:57.760
-Are you okay?
-The photos…

00:59:57.844 --> 01:00:00.847
The photos fell under the bridge.

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:04.350
I tried to get them out of the water,
but all we've got are these films.

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:05.268
What do we do?

01:00:05.351 --> 01:00:06.978
I'm sorry. I don't know what to do.

01:00:07.061 --> 01:00:09.272
It's all good. You did a good job.

01:00:09.355 --> 01:00:11.733
-Are you unhurt?
-Yes, I'm good.

01:00:11.816 --> 01:00:13.318
What do we do? I'm so sorry.

01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:14.235
Don't apologize.

01:00:19.365 --> 01:00:21.075
We've got these, at least.

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:24.954
The film…

01:00:35.173 --> 01:00:37.884
Turn the lights off on my signal, okay?

01:00:38.551 --> 01:00:39.594
Okay.

01:01:04.369 --> 01:01:05.787
What on earth?

01:01:08.373 --> 01:01:10.458
I'd get 30 years, wouldn't I?

01:01:51.457 --> 01:01:58.423
WALKING TO THE SKY

01:02:30.538 --> 01:02:33.458
TYPHOON FAMILY

01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:36.794
Our helmets will be disposed of
if this case isn't closed by 4:00.

01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:40.006
It'll take at least an hour
to get to the port.

01:02:40.548 --> 01:02:41.799
I have something to tell you.

01:02:41.883 --> 01:02:42.800
Thank you.

01:02:42.884 --> 01:02:45.344
I thought about it
and realized I never said this.

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:46.846
I was just doing my job,

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:48.556
whenever I had to do it.
