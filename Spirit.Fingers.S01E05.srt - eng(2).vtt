Oh, well...

I can't make it then.

What?

I-I already watched it.

A couple of days ago,

Got it.

00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:23.767
Hey, Koo Seon Ho.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.533
Can't we just stay friends

without this guy-girl stuff?

Ah, let go!

Are you an idiot?

Oh, seriously...

Why are you sitting like that, looking so lost?

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.833
What?

00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:53.867
Forget it.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.700
Totally forgot.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.167
Need to return this.

Hey.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.900
Isn't that Seon Ho's?

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.967
Why do you still have that?

00:03:28.967 --> 00:03:31.267
Hey. Be honest with me.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.267
This looks better on me than on Seon Ho, right?

00:03:34.267 --> 00:03:36.000
Why are you wearing it? Take it off.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.133
Answer me and I'll give it back.
Who looks better...

What? No, I'll just give it to him.

I told you I'll do it!

00:03:48.267 --> 00:03:50.133

Hey, how long are you going to keep doing this?

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.633
I'll just take it to him.

00:04:07.633 --> 00:04:10.233
- I'll return it.
- No, give it to me.

What am I going to do about this?

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:28.933
It's not even yours, why did you wear it?

00:04:28.933 --> 00:04:32.233
What? Is Seon Ho's cardigan
more important than my head?

00:04:32.233 --> 00:04:33.333
Obviously.

You're more handsome!

00:05:13.433 --> 00:05:16.267
I'll erase him.

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:18.600

I'll erase him for sure.

00:05:43.967 --> 00:05:46.167
They looked perfect together.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.733
Yeah, to the point
where I don't even feel jealous.

00:05:51.367 --> 00:05:52.384
What will you do now?

00:05:53.167 --> 00:05:54.368
Are you going to give up on Seon Ho?

00:05:55.233 --> 00:05:58.144
Or will it turn into a love triangle with Geu Rin?

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.992
I know it's right for me to step back.

00:06:02.367 --> 00:06:05.433
I have eyes, and I'm aware of things.

00:06:05.433 --> 00:06:06.800
Get a grip.

If it were the old you,

you'd just give up, but now

00:06:16.733 --> 00:06:17.824
you've changed, haven't you?

00:06:18.533 --> 00:06:19.936
- Changed?
- Yeah!

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:21.700

When you want something, say it.

That shameless honesty is attractive.

00:06:32.633 --> 00:06:35.900
You always envied people like that, right?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.067
Oh, right.

00:06:54.067 --> 00:06:56.767
I unfollowed my work friend and we fought.

00:06:56.767 --> 00:06:58.800
She was like, 'Hasn't 'Legend' passed its prime?'

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.233
What? Is she insane?

00:07:00.233 --> 00:07:01.400
I know.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.633
So I got mad, and she was like,

00:07:02.633 --> 00:07:05.100
'It's just a joke, why are you getting serious?'

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.767
If it hurts someone, even as a joke,
it's not a joke anymore.

00:07:07.767 --> 00:07:08.767
Exactly.

00:07:08.767 --> 00:07:10.100
Hey, don't meet her.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.300
- We're not even close.
- Then why is she like that?

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.167
Even if it's a joke, if the listener gets hurt,
it's not a joke.

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:15.633
Why do you always talk to me that way?

00:07:15.633 --> 00:07:17.033
Do you know how hurt I feel every time?

00:07:17.033 --> 00:07:19.833
Just because I laughed it off
doesn't mean I wasn't hurt.

00:07:19.833 --> 00:07:21.967
I held back because I didn't
want to fight with my friend over this.

00:07:21.967 --> 00:07:23.833
You should've said something! Why endure?

00:07:23.833 --> 00:07:25.400
Because you're my friend.

00:07:35.333 --> 00:07:39.400
Actually, I almost called Mi Rae last night.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.767
Why?

00:07:40.767 --> 00:07:44.600
After seeing this,
I thought I should just apologize.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.267
Stay firm.

00:07:46.267 --> 00:07:48.367
If you apologize, it'll just
be the same all over again.

00:07:50.067 --> 00:07:51.200
Hey, friend!

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.867
Look, he's back again.

00:07:52.867 --> 00:07:54.367
Wow, he's ridiculously good-looking.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.733
Hey, why are you here again?

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.267
Guys, say hello.

Ah, no...

00:08:05.567 --> 00:08:08.100
She's my female friend, I mean.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.333
Hi.

00:08:09.333 --> 00:08:11.533
- She's pretty and adorable, right?
- You...

00:08:11.533 --> 00:08:12.544
Let's talk for a minute.

00:08:14.633 --> 00:08:17.067
Ah, why? Where are we going?

00:08:17.967 --> 00:08:20.967
What's wrong with you? Why do you keep
showing up at school without telling me?

00:08:21.933 --> 00:08:22.933
Here.

00:08:32.233 --> 00:08:33.367
You bought this?

00:08:33.367 --> 00:08:34.592
You think I found it on the street?

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.256
You are grateful, right?

00:08:37.367 --> 00:08:39.600
Yeah, thanks for this.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:42.933
But,

00:08:43.867 --> 00:08:45.533
I never said I'd give this to you.

00:08:45.533 --> 00:08:47.867
- What?
- I'll deliver it to Seon Ho for you.

00:08:49.167 --> 00:08:52.567
Then why come all the way here?
You could just text me.

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:56.733
Someone headbutted me yesterday.

00:08:56.733 --> 00:08:58.700
My head's been throbbing all day,

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.733
and I feel nauseous.

00:09:03.533 --> 00:09:06.133
Look, I even have a bruise.

00:09:06.133 --> 00:09:07.167
You seem fine to me.

00:09:07.167 --> 00:09:09.633
Fine? Come on, look closer. Closer.

00:09:09.633 --> 00:09:11.367
I said look closely, huh?

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.000
Miss Piggy,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.167
I'll give you a chance to apologize
to my handsome forehead.

00:09:20.233 --> 00:09:21.800
What?

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.800
Guys.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.167
My female friend is buying us a treat.

00:09:24.167 --> 00:09:25.333
Really? Let's go!

00:09:25.333 --> 00:09:26.367
Join us.

00:09:26.367 --> 00:09:27.533
What should we eat?

00:09:37.167 --> 00:09:38.567
Oh, come on, take it easy.

00:09:39.867 --> 00:09:42.500
Here, order away.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.200
I'll have Big Monster Truffle
Incredible Burger Combo.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.467
Then I'll have the Double BLT and
the Shrimptower Sweet Chili Onion Burger Combo.

00:09:48.467 --> 00:09:50.733
Add 2 slices of cheese and 2 slices of bacon,

00:09:50.733 --> 00:09:51.967
and make the drink a Diet Coke, please.

00:09:51.967 --> 00:09:53.433
- Same here.
- Hey, hey.

00:09:53.433 --> 00:09:55.267
Do you think that's going to be enough?

00:09:55.967 --> 00:09:58.333
Double Cheese Potato, Garlic Cheese Potato,

00:09:58.333 --> 00:10:02.300
Bacon Chili Potato, Coleslaw,
Onion Rings, Chicken Nuggets,

and finally, Hash Browns, please.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.233
Are you really paying for all this?

00:10:07.233 --> 00:10:10.000
Total's 48,700 won.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.033
Forty... how much?

00:10:13.033 --> 00:10:16.033
48,700 won, ma'am.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.500
Forty...

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.500
Let's split it.

00:10:32.233 --> 00:10:33.233
Wait!

00:10:34.433 --> 00:10:37.248
I'm behind you.

00:10:37.248 --> 00:10:38.667
Urgh.

00:10:38.667 --> 00:10:40.200
How much was it?

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.633
48,700 won, sir.

00:10:47.867 --> 00:10:49.967
- This.
- This can't be right.

00:10:49.967 --> 00:10:51.200
No, it's correct.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.167
Scoring over 100
on a name compatibility test is rare.

00:11:02.167 --> 00:11:05.267
You two are really meant to be,
just go ahead and date already.

00:11:07.433 --> 00:11:08.467
See?

00:11:08.467 --> 00:11:10.000
126 points.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.633
You and I are meant to be.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.800
She doubts this, huh?

00:11:25.167 --> 00:11:26.200
See this?

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.233
You need to calculate it once more here.

00:11:28.233 --> 00:11:31.300
1 plus 2 is 3, 2 plus 6 is 8,

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.167

See? Name tests are unreliable.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.600
Right, right, right.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.900
Let's try a scientific approach.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.000

and chopsticks with me,

Hey, that doesn't matter.

What do you mean, it doesn't matter?

You're not supposed to mix saliva
from different blood types.

- You're AB type, right?
- Yeah.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.067
AB can safely mix with both A and B types.

- Oh, really?
- You didn't even know that?

- Idiot.
- Probably all of them.

Why would I go to the gallery with you?

00:13:22.333 --> 00:13:24.167
You went with the cardigan's owner
to see paintings, right?

She said she can't come because of cram school.

Is she insane?

Just because she studies a bit,
she suddenly acts like a model student.

Remember that loser we met in the bathroom?

00:13:55.767 --> 00:13:57.633

Yeah, she said that.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.700
- Do your best.
- Fighting.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:21.833
Turn around.

00:21:21.833 --> 00:21:23.633
Ye Rim, do your best on your shoot!

00:21:29.133 --> 00:21:31.500
[Ye Rim, look! Big news]

00:21:36.367 --> 00:21:38.200
He's falling for this nobody?

Song.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.400
Song.

00:21:58.467 --> 00:22:01.133
I was wrong.

00:22:09.733 --> 00:22:11.300
This is embarrassing.

00:22:12.067 --> 00:22:16.900
Actually, I used to think
I was a bit better than you, Song.

00:22:17.667 --> 00:22:20.167
Yeom Se is a top student, pretty

00:22:21.033 --> 00:22:22.976
and popular, so she's
completely out of our league.

00:22:24.933 --> 00:22:28.400
But you joined SF, draw passionately,

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.367
and have a hot guy crushing on you.

00:22:32.033 --> 00:22:34.528
You keep improving while I stay the same.

00:22:36.667 --> 00:22:39.100
That's why I acted petty toward you.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.288
I'm sorry, Song.

00:22:46.167 --> 00:22:47.967
If I could,

00:22:47.967 --> 00:22:51.267
I'd punch my past self in the face.

00:22:51.267 --> 00:22:52.533
But Mi Rae,

00:22:54.467 --> 00:22:56.233
you were right to be confident.

00:22:57.133 --> 00:22:58.200
Huh?

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:02.267
You know what you love and overflow with passion.

00:23:03.567 --> 00:23:06.100
No matter what others say,
you're always true to your feelings.

00:23:08.367 --> 00:23:10.800
I've always envied that about you.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.800
Huh?

00:23:13.833 --> 00:23:15.700
Hey, what's there to envy?

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.433
Why envy something like that?

00:23:17.433 --> 00:23:18.900
Someone like me as a friend?

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.933
If it were me, I would've already cut ties.

00:23:21.767 --> 00:23:23.900
Hey, don't ever mention cutting ties.

00:23:24.667 --> 00:23:27.200
Okay, I won't.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.633
Not even on my deathbed.

00:23:31.233 --> 00:23:32.267
Oh, right.

What's going on with you and Poo-Gi?

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.900
Are you two dating?

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.467
No, why?

00:23:37.467 --> 00:23:40.467
Earlier it looked like he really likes you.

00:23:40.467 --> 00:23:41.500
Earlier?

00:23:42.133 --> 00:23:43.333
You saw everything?

00:23:43.333 --> 00:23:44.367
Huh?

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:46.833
Yeah.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:52.133
I actually followed you
around all day like a stalker.

00:23:52.133 --> 00:23:53.133
Mi Rae.

00:23:57.267 --> 00:23:59.008
I carried this around all day too.

00:24:00.067 --> 00:24:01.728

His beauty's no joke, right?

00:24:12.933 --> 00:24:14.633
Wanna raid the bookstore with me tomorrow?

Let's go.

If you knock, shouldn't you wait for a reply?

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.167
Ugh, knew this would happen.

00:24:31.167 --> 00:24:32.864
Did you get in trouble
for uploading pervy photos again?

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:34.800
Get lost.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.800
Luckily, you were wearing something.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.167
If you were naked, you'd be in trouble, idiot.

00:24:38.167 --> 00:24:39.667
Get out, seriously!

00:24:39.667 --> 00:24:41.632
How dare you yell here?

00:24:42.333 --> 00:24:43.500
Oh yeah, this.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.333
Why'd you leave this here?

00:24:45.333 --> 00:24:46.933
I'm borrowing this.

00:24:46.933 --> 00:24:49.000
Why borrow my shirt? Leave it!

Sorry, my guy friend,
you've been waiting long, right?

Not really.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.733
You look great in that outfit today.

00:25:33.733 --> 00:25:34.733
Huh?

00:25:35.767 --> 00:25:37.867
It's Gi Jeong's shirt. Look good?

00:25:37.867 --> 00:25:40.333
I think I look good in men's clothes.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.200
Seems so.

No, you have to.

- Ow, hot.
- Hey!

- You're really...
- Your boyfriend told you to be careful.

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:16.967
Darn exams are finally over!

00:42:22.368 --> 00:42:25.000
Not long ago, it was all Seon Ho,

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.300
and now love's changed?

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:28.000
I told you, it's not like that.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.072
If walking around together
after exams isn't a date, then what is?

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:32.900
Academic research?

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:34.567
Wow, Song's so lucky.

00:42:34.567 --> 00:42:36.200
We'll get out of your way.

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.067
- Have a good date.
- Bye!

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.033
I said it's not like that.

00:42:41.033 --> 00:42:43.367
- So jealous, so jealous.
- Enjoy your date.

00:42:45.067 --> 00:42:46.533
It's really not like that.

00:42:47.767 --> 00:42:50.133
Hey, it's not like that!

00:42:51.867 --> 00:42:53.667
Do well on your exams.

00:42:53.667 --> 00:42:55.500
I'll pick you up when your exams end.

00:43:03.533 --> 00:43:04.933
Why isn't he coming?

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.792
- What?
- I was worried you didn't reply.

00:43:22.767 --> 00:43:24.200
Didn't you see my photos?

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:26.067
- Saw them.
- You okay?

00:43:26.067 --> 00:43:29.633
It's just a photo, but he totally
got hooked on that loser.

00:43:29.633 --> 00:43:33.533
We were all so pissed watching that,
so we were really worried about you.

00:43:33.533 --> 00:43:36.267
- Right?
- Yeah, true.

00:43:39.233 --> 00:43:41.767
So you want to help me?

00:43:41.767 --> 00:43:44.333
- Huh?
- What are you talking about?

00:43:44.333 --> 00:43:47.712
If you guys are stepping in for me,
I won't turn you down.

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:50.867
Thanks, guys.

00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:00.367
What's going on? The plan's gone wrong.

00:44:00.367 --> 00:44:04.033
You said if we send them over, Ahn Ye Rim
will get mad and confront her for us.

00:44:04.033 --> 00:44:05.632
She's really sly, isn't she?

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.000
Nah, forget it.

00:44:08.833 --> 00:44:11.167
We don't need to do what she says anymore.

00:44:11.167 --> 00:44:12.512
Ugh, whatever. Just do it.

00:44:13.467 --> 00:44:16.200
That loser deserves to be taken down anyway.

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:18.833
Let's do it,

00:44:18.833 --> 00:44:20.033
and if we get caught,

00:44:20.033 --> 00:44:21.312
let's say Ahn Ye Rim made us do it.

00:44:24.867 --> 00:44:28.000
[I'm done now. Where are you? Coming?]

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.633
Nam Gi Jeong, what's wrong with you?

00:44:30.633 --> 00:44:31.800
Did I tell him to come pick me up?

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:32.928
Did I ask him to go see the paintings?

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:35.700
He's really making a fool of me.

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:41.500
Did something happen to him?

00:44:50.367 --> 00:44:54.733
[Miss Piggy]

What the heck? What?

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:41.933
What the heck!

[Date approaching for those who wait, D-DAY]

00:45:47.367 --> 00:45:48.633
What the heck!

00:45:48.633 --> 00:45:49.667
That crazy punk.

00:45:49.667 --> 00:45:51.367
Why didn't that punk wake me up?

00:45:54.633 --> 00:45:56.033
Oh no.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.216
Sir, I didn't bring my wallet.
Can I pay you later?

00:46:10.467 --> 00:46:11.600
Bank transfer, bank transfer.

00:46:17.568 --> 00:46:18.944
Shoot.

00:46:26.233 --> 00:46:28.167
So? He didn't come?

00:46:28.167 --> 00:46:29.833
- Yeah.
- Wow, ridiculous.

00:46:29.833 --> 00:46:30.900
Got stood up?

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:32.333
What's up with that guy?

00:46:32.333 --> 00:46:33.867
He kept begging to meet up!

00:46:33.867 --> 00:46:36.567
But he's not the type to do this.

00:46:36.567 --> 00:46:37.967
What do you mean 'not the type'?

00:46:37.967 --> 00:46:39.900
At best, he just forgot.

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:40.992
That's just as bad, punk.

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:43.648
He promised to pick me up.

00:46:44.533 --> 00:46:46.200
He wouldn't do this.

00:46:51.367 --> 00:46:52.467
Mi Rae,

00:46:52.467 --> 00:46:53.867
I think I need to go back.

Why? They said it'll rain today.

00:46:56.667 --> 00:46:59.433
Just go home. Don't waste your time.

00:46:59.433 --> 00:47:00.767
I'll call you again.

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:03.400
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:47:07.467 --> 00:47:09.133
Hi, loser.

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:26.667
My phone!

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:29.533
Darn it.

00:47:37.267 --> 00:47:38.528
Where are you going?

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:41.000
We're not done yet.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.267
What business could I have with you?

00:47:44.267 --> 00:47:46.033
I said what I have to say last time.

00:47:47.133 --> 00:47:49.000
Told you to stop living like that.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.167
- You crazy.
- What's she saying?

00:47:51.167 --> 00:47:52.200
Ugh.

00:47:53.167 --> 00:47:56.200
You should've listened when I asked nicely.

00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:58.767
Come on, stop making a fuss.

00:47:58.767 --> 00:47:59.767
Get up.

00:48:01.167 --> 00:48:02.900
Hey, I said get up.

00:48:08.267 --> 00:48:10.533
Hey, let's go.

Thank you.

You didn't have to do this.

00:48:54.467 --> 00:48:56.067
I'm just sorry.

00:48:56.733 --> 00:48:59.700
Actually, I saw everything earlier.

00:49:00.767 --> 00:49:03.833
But I was too scared to stop it.

00:49:04.767 --> 00:49:08.767
They're notorious bullies at our school.

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:12.767
- I'm sorry.
- No, no.

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:18.496
Honestly, I'm a scaredy-cat too,
so I wouldn't have stopped them.

00:49:21.467 --> 00:49:24.096
I'm Ahn Ye Rim, first-year at Shinhwa High.

00:49:24.767 --> 00:49:27.467
I'm Song U Yeon, second-year at Haesol High.

00:49:27.467 --> 00:49:29.728
Then you're older. Please don't be so formal.

00:49:30.533 --> 00:49:31.648
But U Yeon,

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:35.200
you said you were scared,
but you were really brave earlier.

00:49:36.333 --> 00:49:37.333
You said everything you needed to.

00:49:37.333 --> 00:49:38.833
It's not that.

00:49:42.933 --> 00:49:46.464
I was just really pissed
because someone stood me up today.

00:49:48.733 --> 00:49:51.367
Stood up?

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:54.733
Your boyfriend?

00:49:54.733 --> 00:49:56.000
Huh?

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.267
No, no.

00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:02.433
Just a friend. A friend.

00:50:05.567 --> 00:50:06.900
A guy friend.

00:50:17.067 --> 00:50:18.240
Thanks for today.

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:22.100
If it weren't for you,
I'd have been pretty miserable.

00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:23.300
And it was raining.

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:25.733
Not at all.

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:29.856
Can I get your number?

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:34.300
- Huh?
- Think it'd be fun to chat sometimes.

00:50:36.267 --> 00:50:38.464
This is embarrassing,

00:50:39.633 --> 00:50:41.933
but I don't have close friends to talk to.

00:50:45.067 --> 00:50:46.100
Give it to me.

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.133
Save it.

00:50:54.133 --> 00:50:55.567
Of course.

00:50:55.567 --> 00:50:57.300
I'll text you sometimes then.

00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:58.467
See you around, U Yeon.

00:50:58.467 --> 00:50:59.767
- Bye.
- See you.

00:51:50.176 --> 00:51:51.500
Well...

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:54.567
- I'm sorry.
- You okay?

00:51:54.567 --> 00:51:55.733
Huh?

00:51:55.733 --> 00:51:57.100
What happened to you?

00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:58.367
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:51:59.067 --> 00:52:00.933
You've been standing in the rain?

00:52:00.933 --> 00:52:02.267
Don't you have an umbrella?

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.267
No umbrella,

00:52:06.267 --> 00:52:09.344
no money, no phone.

00:52:09.344 --> 00:52:10.667
Are you crying?

00:52:10.667 --> 00:52:11.900
I'm sorry.

00:52:14.112 --> 00:52:19.033
I was so excited thinking about dating you
that I stayed up for three days,

00:52:19.733 --> 00:52:21.533
so I passed out a bit.

00:52:21.533 --> 00:52:25.367
My friends are so stupid like me.

00:52:25.367 --> 00:52:29.367
I told them to set my alarm for 8 AM,
but they set it to 8 PM.

00:52:29.367 --> 00:52:33.267
So I rushed over right after waking up
and even left my phone behind.

00:52:33.267 --> 00:52:35.233
And it was raining, but I didn't have an umbrella.

00:52:37.133 --> 00:52:38.267
I'm sorry.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.800
I only understood half of it, but it's okay.

00:52:43.433 --> 00:52:47.600
You're not... mad, are you?

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:49.567
I was angry at first,

00:52:49.567 --> 00:52:53.088
but then I thought about it, and you're
not the type to do that without saying anything.

00:52:54.033 --> 00:52:56.000
I was worried something happened to you.

00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:58.733
Worried?

00:52:58.733 --> 00:52:59.767
Yeah.

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:06.784
I was scared while waiting for you.

00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:09.767
I rushed over and you weren't here.

00:53:09.767 --> 00:53:12.100
Waited in front of your house, but you never came.

00:53:12.867 --> 00:53:16.767
I was trying to erase Seon Ho from your mind,
but I was afraid I'd be erased instead.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.800
You can't erase things that way.

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:21.033
Your presence is too strong to be erased.

00:53:21.033 --> 00:53:22.133
Really?

00:53:23.433 --> 00:53:25.267
I really can't be erased, right?

00:53:25.967 --> 00:53:26.967
You.

00:53:27.667 --> 00:53:31.567
If you spill tteokbokki sauce on your uniform,
does it wash off easily?

00:53:31.567 --> 00:53:33.400
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You're a Red.

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.067
- Gochujang-colored.
- Hey.

00:53:35.067 --> 00:53:36.700
What kind of metaphor is that?

00:53:39.233 --> 00:53:41.500
Hey, did you catch a cold?

00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:43.800
No, I don't get sick easily.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.567
Go home now, take some medicine, and sleep.

00:53:48.567 --> 00:53:50.367
- I don't want to.
- Come on, hurry.

00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:55.067
I'm not going home.

00:53:56.233 --> 00:53:57.376
Let's stay together a bit longer.

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:00.200
Okay?

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:15.600
Why do you even like me?

00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:17.733
What?

00:54:17.733 --> 00:54:20.900
Don't say nonsense like
'because your earlobes are pretty.'

00:54:22.133 --> 00:54:23.936
Honestly, it doesn't make sense for someone

00:54:24.733 --> 00:54:26.976
as amazing as you to like someone
as average as me.

00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:30.272
There's no special reason or anything.

00:54:31.667 --> 00:54:33.533
Who said you're average?

00:54:33.533 --> 00:54:35.300
You're super unique.

00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:38.400
Among all the girls I know,
there's no one like you.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.167
That kinda sounds like an insult?

00:54:43.167 --> 00:54:44.367
It's a compliment.

00:54:44.367 --> 00:54:45.633
It's not.

00:54:45.633 --> 00:54:46.733
It is.

00:55:05.633 --> 00:55:06.667
I just like you.

00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:11.533
Just?

00:55:13.067 --> 00:55:16.600
When someone likes someone else,
does there have to be a reason?

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:19.933
Feelings just happen suddenly, that's all.

00:55:23.667 --> 00:55:24.667
Just...

00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:28.833
Are we still friends?

00:55:28.833 --> 00:55:29.867
Huh?

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.133
I don't know.

00:55:46.067 --> 00:55:47.133
Then...

00:55:48.033 --> 00:55:49.067
Huh?

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.300
Then...

00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:54.300
What?

00:56:02.133 --> 00:56:03.567
Should we try kissing?

00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:06.167
What?

00:56:06.167 --> 00:56:07.167
A kiss.

00:56:16.033 --> 00:56:20.300
♫ Tell me, you already know ♫

00:56:21.733 --> 00:56:26.528
♫ You know exactly what I'm trying to say ♫

00:56:27.168 --> 00:56:28.600
You were excited, no?

00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:30.600
Oh my god, you're insane, absolutely insane!

00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:32.833
Let's change tactics. It's time to stop chasing.

00:56:32.833 --> 00:56:34.400
Harley Quinn. The icon of vengeance.

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.633
Today's our date.

00:56:35.633 --> 00:56:36.967
Unless you're a stalker?

00:56:36.967 --> 00:56:38.500
I didn't do anything wrong.

00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:40.800
But because of you,
people call me ugly and a stalker.

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:42.233
It's a gift. Pretty, right?

00:56:42.233 --> 00:56:44.100
- Oh, you're matching.
- Matching, my foot!

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:45.400
- You look cute today.
- Don't be silly.

00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:47.168
What kind of pathetic club is that?

00:56:47.168 --> 00:56:49.700
Just because you don't like it
doesn't mean you should belittle it.

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:52.567
Pretending to be fine
and acting like nothing's wrong.

00:56:52.567 --> 00:56:54.233
Keeping a poker face is easier anyway.

00:56:54.233 --> 00:56:55.367
- Hey.
- You!

00:56:55.367 --> 00:56:56.567
I'll take full responsibility.

00:56:56.567 --> 00:56:57.967
You'll take responsibility?

00:57:03.033 --> 00:57:04.448
Hey, hey.

00:57:04.448 --> 00:57:06.400
- Why did I do that?
- Hey, what?

00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:09.033
- Why?
- Why's he like that?

00:57:09.033 --> 00:57:10.800
Why? Why?

00:57:11.467 --> 00:57:12.633
Why?

00:57:12.633 --> 00:57:14.600
Let's leave, let's get out.

00:57:15.767 --> 00:57:18.267
- Darn it.
- Let's go now.
