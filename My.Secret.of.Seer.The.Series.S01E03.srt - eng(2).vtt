00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.280
One, two, and three!

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.200
- Smile a bit more.
- Hey.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.616
Do I look good? Focus harder, dmn it.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.880
I know. Smile!

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.520
Hey.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.840
Can you help me take a photo?

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.000
Do you believe in destiny?

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.280
This was my first time

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.080
that I got to meet

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.080
Win.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.760
My grandpa called this encounter

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.480
"destiny."

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.040
However, I came to the conclusion

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.920
that it was just a coincidence.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.120
A love that spans every lifetime

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.440
is nonsense.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.960
There's no such thing.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.080
It's all just a massive coincidence,

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.280
just an occurrence.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.400
Things should've ended there

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.360
at our second coincidental encounter.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.800
This was our third encounter.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.600
I don't believe in merit and fortune.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.960
They're nonsensical to me.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.320
They're outside scientific boundaries.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.240
Yet, I couldn't find a way
to object to my grandpa's reading.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.760
Even though I tried
not to believe in destiny,

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.840
I couldn't just stand

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.920
to see the one in front of me in peril.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.560
You've got feelings for me, Master?

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.680
Who says that I have?

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.400
I just want to talk to you

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.240
about the work.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.480
Yes, the work.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.800
You were staring at me
for minutes, though.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.520
Well...

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.840
If you knew,
then why didn't you say anything?

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.360
I saw you staring down at my chest,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.440
and I was curious
about what you'd do next.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.800
Nuts!

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.520
You pervert. I wasn't doing that.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.600
I'm going to tell everyone
you stared at my chest.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.640
Hey!

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.200
Stop it, Phloeng.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.440
I didn't stare at your chest.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.560
Help!

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.920
This pervert of a seer
was staring at my chest!

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.680
I wasn't doing that!

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.760
What's with you?

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.040
Oh, Master?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.560
I've got something
to talk to Phloeng.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.600
Feel free.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.200
What is it?

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.320
It's nothing now.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.080
I'd like to talk to Master,

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.440
now that he's here.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.720
You can talk here.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.120
Aren't you supposed
to be on the podcast?

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.080
Of course.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.600
I'm going there with Master.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.800
Well...

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.440
Master, do you have time
for a meal with me?

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.840
He doesn't.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.720
He needs to have his makeup done.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.800
Have a meal in the changing room.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.440
Here you go.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.360
Whoa!

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.360
Our boss is so generous today.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.000
Is this due to a special occasion
or something?

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.520
I noticed you guys
were in a hurry for the show.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.200
I was worried
you might've to skip a meal.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.600
Sheesh.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.280
Our boss is both handsome

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.000
and generous, right?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.480
You two have amazing skin,

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.160
both Phloeng

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.360
and Master Win.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.120
What skincare product do you use?

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.760
I'll look for it the moment you tell me.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.520
I forgot its name, actually.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.600
Namo usually gets it for me.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.080
Once I'm home,
I'll send you photos of it, okay?

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.640
No problem.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.160
What about you, Phloeng?

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.520
Your complexion is very smooth.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.400
I simply wash it with water.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.480
Whoa!

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.200
What are you looking at?

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.560
Nothing.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.400
If you want to stare at my chest,

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.680
just ask.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.160
Here you go.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.200
This one is yours, Win.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.200
Thank you.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.800
What about mine?

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.560
Yours?

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.800
I've got none.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.160
The auspicious
Golden Dragon facial features...

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.800
Born with abundant fortune
and blessings...

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.320
The guest is here, Phloeng.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.200
Well...

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.720
I'll give you guys a quick briefing,

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.320
so Master is on the same page.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.920
Today's guest is Chai.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.440
Hello, Master.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.120
- Hello, Phloeng.
- Hello.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.080
Is...

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.600
Is he related to a royal family?

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.240
Oh, no, Master.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.080
Chai is his name, not "Prince" in Thai.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.680
You're quite comedic, aren't you?

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.280
Chai is going to share his experience

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.000
about his bad luck year.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.320
What about his bad luck year?

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.720
He'd been seeing ghosts
that entire year,

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.040
and he's going to talk about it today.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.320
That's it.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.480
Hey, you.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.520
Whoa!

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.480
Yes?

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.680
Visiting the building?

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.800
Yes, I am.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.960
Let me go in for a while.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.240
Go in?

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.600
Yes, I'm about to go in.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.160
Hey, what's up?

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.280
I've arrived and am about to go inside.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.400
Okay. Be seeing you.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.840
What the hell?

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.640
The seating should do the trick.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.320
As for the lighting, it's all good now.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.560
I think we're good to go.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.040
My apologies.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.200
- I think this is alright.
- I'm Win's friend.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.320
Right.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.360
Are we good?

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.960
- Yes, we're ready to roll.
- Go for it.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.560
Shall we start?

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.880
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.840
Okay, everybody.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.080
If you're ready, let's roll.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.560
Okay, speed!

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:38.720
Hello.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.880
You're watching 'Spooky Hellish Night, '

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.360
a fiery night haunted
by horrors of the unknown.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.240
I'm Phloengnathitorn,

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.000
and I'm joined by the White Knight Seer

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.960
and our guest for today's horror story,

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.280
Chai.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.776
Good to see you, Phloeng and Master.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.640
- Hello.
- Good to see you, too.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.800
Let's do this.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.400
I've heard that your horror story

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.840
is about your bad luck year?

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.080
That's right, Phloeng.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.720
It was when I turned exactly 25

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.520
that the bad luck year
manifested itself.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.720
How long has it been
since your bad luck year?

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.240
It's already been
quite a while, actually.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.560
I was tasked
to oversee a construction site.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.760
I was there
with my two engineering friends.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.360
Chai, I'm here.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.800
Chai, what the fuck are you looking at?

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.120
Guys,

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.360
I think it got me.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.800
What the hell are you on about?

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.520
I saw a charred woman.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.280
She was smiling at me.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.320
Are you insane?

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.440
Your brain's fried.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.560
Are you hammered or what?

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.200
- No.
- He's not drunk.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.680
Handsome, a misfortune
is coming your way.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.680
You're 25, aren't you?

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.920
Yes.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.000
You haven't been ordained
for your parents either?

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.200
I haven't.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.680
Then do so without delay.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.360
Your misfortune will be eased.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.520
Do it as soon as you can.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.160
At least, you should be ordained
for three months.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.360
Three months?

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.560
But I...

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.560
And...

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.920
Did you do it?

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.800
I didn't.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.160
If I chose to be ordained,

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.536
it'd take up three months of my life,

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.760
and that would affect my annual bonus.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.400
I see.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.440
That's understandable.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.640
Ordination costs
a lot of money, Phloeng.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.200
One example is my cousin.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.496
He was sent
to be ordained and to study,

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.720
but in the end,

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.176
he didn't finish his studies.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.560
After that, he became a troublemaker.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.880
He was jobless at the age of 30.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:39.920
Eventually,

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.400
his parents had to send
him a monthly allowance.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.640
Wouldn't it be better to get a job
and support them instead?

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.040
At any rate,

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.400
my bad luck year got me good.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.600
Hold on...

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.120
What happened?

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.520
Don't tell me that

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.440
you're sensing something?

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.480
Is the studio light

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.960
going to flicker again?

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.160
Uh...

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.240
Not that.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.680
I need to use the bathroom.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.560
I've been holding it for so long.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.760
I can't hold it any longer.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:08.600
Huh?

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:09.840
Huh?

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.160
I'm really sorry.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:12.880
Please excuse me.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.280
Oh, dear.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.960
Anybody there?

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.840
Can you pass me some toilet paper?

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.016
Win, why didn't you relieve yourself
before the session?

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.720
Everybody else is waiting for you.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.920
It's Tul's.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.480
Is he this kind to everyone?

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.320
Come on. I'll be done soon, Tong.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.280
Just a second, Tong.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.240
What the hell?

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.480
That was perfect timing, wasn't it?

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.080
It was.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.400
- Please sit tight.
- Sure, no problem.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.360
Uh...

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.480
I'm sorry.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.120
I'm truly sorry.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.000
I'm sorry for wasting everybody's time.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.640
It's nothing, Master.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.520
Now...

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.400
Please continue, Chai.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.960
Oh, sure.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.040
Where were we?

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.960
Master Win needed to use the toilet.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:54.640
Right!

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.880
Not that.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.640
Oh.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.200
You were suggested to be ordained.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.840
Oh, you're right.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.040
Here's the story, Phloeng.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.160
I see ordination as a belief.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.600
The term "bad luck year"
has only recently become a trendy word.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.120
I'm confused as to
why people are so scared by it.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.160
What about other religions,

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.280
such as Christianity?

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.160
Do I also have to be ordained
and make merit, like in Buddhism?

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.440
I think there's a gap in this logic.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.760
- I like your explanation, Chai.
- Thank you.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.240
Unfortunately, my story
didn't end there.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.080
Why is that?

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.880
Do you guys remember that I saw

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.840
a woman back there?

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.160
I met her again.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.280
Whoa...

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.480
Ow...

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.520
Hey, Chai!

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.960
- Chai! Are you alright?
- What's wrong?

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.160
- Ow...
- What happened?

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.640
Shit! Your leg is in rough shape.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.960
- Ouch...
- Call rescue services!

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.480
Call them now!

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.880
Easy, Chai.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.120
Stay still.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.040
Easy there.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.320
- He's stuck at a site in Min Buri.
- He's bleeding a lot.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.720
His leg got crushed by steel.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.480
Please come here immediately.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.320
You will not have a peaceful end,

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.720
and neither will you!

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.320
Why?

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.200
She won't leave you be, Chai.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.720
Your only way out

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.440
is to be ordained as soon as possible.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.320
Do so even with your broken leg.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.640
If you refuse,

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.760
you'll die at the age of 26.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:08.960
What?

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.320
26?

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.960
Stop reading cards.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.800
Use your sense

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.520
and find the Radiance of the Seven Gems.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.896
What are you
talking about, fortune teller?

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.440
And who is she?

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.640
She was your lover in your past life.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.360
Huh?

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.640
You shouldn't have promised her love
in every lifetime.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.680
My love from my past life?

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.440
In my past life,
I had to work in a different city.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.440
I didn't get to see her for years.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.840
So, I sought someone else.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.680
She was heartbroken when she found out

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.800
and died of grief.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.280
Before she died, she pledged

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.040
to relentlessly torment me
in every single lifetime.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.160
My only way out

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.920
was to be ordained
to sever the karmic ties.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.080
Whoa...

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.640
That's really horrifying.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:59.360
And...

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.840
Have you been ordained?

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.120
I ran out of options,

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.400
so I had to be ordained.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.120
I was ordained at a forest monastery.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.880
Nobody was allowed to visit me.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.200
Alms rounds were forbidden.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.960
I had to stay inside the living quarters
for three months.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.160
I also had to observe the precepts
just like a monk, about 200 of them.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.040
It felt like I was in literal hell.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.960
I was told

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.760
not to leave the living quarters
for three months.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.040
If I left,

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.920
she'd take my life,
and I'd be gone for good.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.840
Good job for pulling through.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.440
Thank you.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.960
There's something I still doubt, though.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.880
Is the ghost woman gone?

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:45.960
Well then...

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.360
Let me take care of your doubt.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.160
Thank you.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.680
The High Priestess

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.560
depicts two sides of emotions.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.960
However, in this case,
it might depict the ghost woman.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.280
As for the Nine of Wands,

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.240
a card depicting a man holding a wand,

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.880
looking at other wands behind him,

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.920
might represent
the concern and attachment.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.120
As for the last card,

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.680
the Judgment,

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.160
it signifies reckoning.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.320
With these three cards combined,
it signifies that

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.200
she's still there.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.120
She hasn't gone anywhere.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.560
She's there, waiting for you.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.800
So...

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.080
I guess there's nothing you can do

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.120
aside from making merit.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.200
If that doesn't work,

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.640
try...

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.920
making merit and dedicating it
to your guardian angel.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.160
This could possibly lift
some of the karma.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.440
It could also grant you protection

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.840
so that your guardian angel
could fight back.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:00.920
Right.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.960
Um...

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.880
Master, you said the same thing as a forest monk.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.720
The wording is exactly the same.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:07.760
Whoa.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.120
Your reading sure is accurate.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.856
- Thank you so much, Master Win.
- Thank you.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:11.936
Thank you very much, Phloeng.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:12.960
Thank you.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:17.880
For today's EP, a big thank you
goes to Master Win and Chai,

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.440
for sharing
a horrifying experience with us.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.960
We hope that

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.120
you'll be free from the karma soon.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.160
Sadhu.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.160
I want to be free
from this so bad myself.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.976
- I hope it happens soon.
- Sure.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.560
I'll put Master's suggestions to use.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.240
- I'll make merit.
- Sure.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.680
I've never seen anything like this.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.160
You're amazing.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.280
You've become more
of an extrovert, you know?

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.640
This is enough, Tong.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
It's exhausting.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.360
I never knew that
being a celebrity could be this tiring.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:54.600
Come on.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.080
It's for the money.

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.120
Keep that in mind.

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.840
Next up on the list,

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.640
you have a fortune reading session
for an influential tycoon.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:04.680
Hold up, Tong.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.960
If there's a problem,

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.040
feel free to inform me.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.080
Tul.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.680
Yes?

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.760
Please excuse me.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:22.960
Thank you.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.040
Yes, Master?

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.240
I'm giving this back to you.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.640
I even told Tong not to
tell you whose it is.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.240
He didn't tell me that.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.440
I'm Master Win after all.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.880
The podcast was such a treat.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.400
Uh...

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.560
What is it that you want
to talk to me about again?

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.920
Oh.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.376
It was about the podcast, actually.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.520
I really want you
to have a dedicated show.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.840
Having a channel would be great.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.080
Well...

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.800
I'm not that confident about the idea.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.160
I did it,
but it didn't have that many views.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:05.920
So I switched to doing
one-on-one fortune-telling sessions.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.400
You look cute
doing a livestream, though.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.800
Well, I mean...

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.400
How about you do livestreams
on your own channel?

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.400
Is it a good idea, Tul?

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:18.840
It is.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.640
If you jump to being a show host,
it'd feel a bit awkward.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.520
Sometimes, starting by doing livestreams

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.000
on your own

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.280
and finding your own style

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.520
is a great idea.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.960
The thing is that I've tried it,

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.640
but it's been on hold right now.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.720
I'll look into doing that later.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.840
Be confident, Master.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.880
I'll tune in.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.080
Right.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.640
Phloeng!

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.320
I'm heading home now.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.880
Look at me while talking to me.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.960
Why are you staring at my chest?

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.080
I'm not doing that.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.680
You didn't forget
to bring your cards today?

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.680
Not anymore.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:19.680
Hey, look out!

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.040
Master, watch out!

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.200
Master?

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.320
Are you alright?

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.040
Are you okay, Master?

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.040
Right.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.320
I'm good.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.800
Don't tell me that

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.640
the reckoning is upon me.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.440
I'll do it myself.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.040
It's too troubling for you to do it.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.360
I'll do it for you.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.520
Treat your own wound first.
You've got scratches, too.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.400
Here. Let me do it.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.080
No need. I'll do it.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.880
Please!

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.520
That's enough.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:30.640
That's it, correct?

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.280
Thank you, both of you.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.720
I have to get going now.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.240
Let's go, Tong.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:41.960
Let's head back to our place.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:56.800
Here.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.160
Treat your own wound.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:34.880
Namo.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.680
You wouldn't believe

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.240
what I've experienced.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:39.960
Why?

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.040
A chest?

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.680
Tong told me
you were talking to Phloeng.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.040
It was about his chest, right?

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.760
No, it wasn't me.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.800
It's not that!

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.040
Out of the blue,

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:54.040
a potted plant
almost dropped on my head.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.720
Fortunately,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.200
Phloeng and Tul saved me,

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.400
or else I would've kicked the bucket.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.600
I think...

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.320
It's coming for me,

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.120
my bad luck year.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.840
Bad luck year, my ass.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.600
For once, look at things
from a scientific perspective.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.520
Is someone
who is eager to see ghosts like you

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.000
really allowed to say that?

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.840
Ghosts are science-related!

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.000
It's just that they can't be proven yet.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:24.920
Do you know
the term "unverified assumption"?

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.480
Let's just say that, for now,

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.640
I want you guys to spend
a few nights with me.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.800
I've been seeing stuff lately.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.920
What stuff are you talking about?

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:40.880
I feel like I've been able
to connect to something.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.200
I don't know if it's true
or my imagination.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:46.800
You...

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.040
You've obtained another superpower?

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.000
I've heard that

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.520
people who will die soon

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.240
will have more powers.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.120
Is that so?

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.880
I've read it in a book.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.280
Right. Whatever.

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.520
Please come and spend your nights here.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.360
Come on.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.216
I've always been there with you so much

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.160
that my dad thinks I'm dating you.

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.200
Just tell him that you are.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:14.800
I'm a top.

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:15.880
Nope.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.920
I'm a top.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.720
We'll take turns. That's it.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:19.976
Tong will be a bottom, okay?

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.480
Gosh! This is disgusting!

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.880
Don't talk about this
anywhere else, okay?

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.960
People would misunderstand
the three of us.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.800
Make sure that the doors are locked

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.520
and that the yantras are intact.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.280
Chakart is also in her room.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.120
Knock on her door if you need anything.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.080
Let's just say she's your neighbor.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.400
There's nothing to be afraid of.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:46.880
- Shit!
- Fuck!

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:49.880
Shit!

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.400
- Is it a ghost?
- Tong!

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:54.920
Chakart!

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.680
A ghost!

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.040
Gosh!

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.680
Come on in!

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.160
What's going on?

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.840
It's like you're running from a ghost.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.200
Why am I just standing here?

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.520
Tell me what's on your mind.

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:33.560
And you...

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.760
Looks like you've got
something on your mind, too.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.000
I...

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:39.840
I have none.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.320
Neither do I.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.520
Right.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.680
I actually do.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:49.920
About what?

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:51.920
Do you think that

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.000
something weird is going on
at the office?

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.600
How exactly?

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.720
I'm still fine.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.400
No.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.040
Like...

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.080
There are just so many strange things.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.800
If you're talking about that...

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.240
Nokphaeng didn't mean it.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.400
Mm.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.400
I...

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.280
That's what I've also heard.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.440
But whatever.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.320
I know what you're trying
to do to Master.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:26.800
Do what?

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.400
I was just being sweet to him.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.160
He's at the office to work, no?

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.080
I also know

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.720
what you're trying to do.

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.360
I'm not.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.240
I'm simply

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.920
taking care of him as part of my job.

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.520
Righto.

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:45.880
I hope that is true.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.400
Right.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.320
You're the one who should keep your word.

00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:58.840
Hey, boys.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.200
Make yourselves at home, okay?

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.720
Don't be scared.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.440
Understood?

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.240
Thank you.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.680
Honestly...

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.480
Why didn't we chant incantations
to fight back?

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.360
Yeah.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
That would've gotten us
to sleep comfortably.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.760
You're right.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.520
I think

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.160
you're better than what you think.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.760
As for karmic creditors,

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.960
you can smash them, right?

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.480
He's right.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.040
Remember when you exorcised a ghost
at my brother's house?

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.200
That was just me being lucky.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.000
Still, thank you

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.640
for making my night better,

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.040
even though you want to see ghosts.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.200
If a ghost wants to claim your life,

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.440
why don't you do it to them first?

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.800
You're such a...

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.640
What a waste of your ghost experiences.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.920
Enough, guys.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.440
We have to prepare for tomorrow.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.080
Prepare for livestreaming?

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.080
Prepare to be sweaty.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:05.600
Gosh!

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.640
You have a really dirty mind, Namo!

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.600
A fortune-telling session

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.080
is like breaking a sweat.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.040
Let's see who will make you all sweaty.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.120
Stop it, Namo.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.480
Just get back to your funeral things.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:19.720
Come on!

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.240
You're...

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.600
Make sure your client is satisfied.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:26.480
Stop it already!

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.680
It's you again?

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.080
Why the hell
do you want to come after me so badly?

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.680
This time...

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.080
I'm coming for you,

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.400
my karmic creditor.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.920
Are you ready?

00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.480
Are you ready?!

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.040
Ready for fucking what?!

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.320
Phloeng?

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.680
What's going on?

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.600
Good question.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.680
Are we in a dream?

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.160
And...

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:21.720
Whose dream is this?

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000
It's mine.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.080
That means...

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.680
Hello, I'm Win, a seer.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.040
Today, I'm going to do
a personal card reading for you guys.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.120
(Fear: Hello, Master Win)

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.840
(SUM: Hello)

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.720
(Gib: Hi!)

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:28.960
(Tony: Please do mine)

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.800
(nana: Yay, you're live!)

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.000
So many viewers.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:43.320
(Gae: Yay! You're here!)

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:43.960
(OH: Yay! I'm so happy you're live)

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:44.480
(ZARA: Hello!!)

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:45.400
(BOB: Let me be your first one)

00:32:45.401 --> 00:32:46.416
(NOI: I wish Phloeng
were there with you)

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.440
(MA: Win, my boy!)

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:57.960
Goodness gracious!

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.440
3,000 viewers?!

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.400
I've never had this many viewers.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.680
Your personal card
is similar to your guardian angel.

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:11.080
There are over 70 different tarot cards.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.600
Each has unique characteristics.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:18.960
Your card, therefore, is distinct
and reflects your unique character.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.080
And I generally only reveal three cards.

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:26.040
(MA: Win, my boy!)

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.120
(MA: You're so cute)

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.600
(MA: You're the cutest fortune teller of all)

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.960
(MA: I want to squeeze
your cheeks so bad)

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.560
(NEW: I'm excited
to see you read the cards!)

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:41.360
Today, I'll be randomly picking viewers
for a card reading session.

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.840
(KAE: The way you said "cards"
is so adorable)

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.040
(Tachang: How does the lucky draw work?)

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.040
"How does the lucky draw work?"

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:51.920
That's a good question.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.640
I haven't thought about it.

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.920
(Tachang: How about picking a number?)

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.800
(Tachang: Then we'll try to guess it)

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:03.920
(Tachang: The first one to
correctly guess the number wins)

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.240
That's a very good idea.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.640
Thank you, Tachang.

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.920
The number I'm thinking of is

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.360
07.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.880
Our first lucky winner is Tachang,

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.120
one of my first fans.

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.560
Tachang, please concentrate.

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:47.120
May your guardian angel
reveal your destiny.

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:50.720
Then, I'd like to do a reading
of your personal card.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.720
Tachang,

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.840
you're such a hardworking individual.

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.680
You're good at your job.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.200
You're born to work.

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:03.560
You're the backbone of your family.

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.680
You're a reliable person

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.480
and have excellent leadership.

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.600
When your friends
or partner is in trouble,

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.480
it's usually you

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.880
who helps and supports them.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:18.040
This is your true self, Tachang.

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.240
Your personal card is...

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.040
Oh, by the way,

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.880
you seem to wander a lot.

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.400
(Tachang: Should I start
hitting on someone?)

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:39.600
Your reading suggests that you do it.

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:43.200
I think you
may already have met that person.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.000
So go for it.

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.440
I'm rooting for you.

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.520
Hello, Tong.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:03.880
Yes, Tul?

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.520
Can you check Master Win's schedule?

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:07.880
Why?

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.320
I'd like to discuss the show with him

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.800
and invite him to have dinner with me

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.480
as a celebration for hitting 1M views.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.280
Absolutely.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.320
As for the thing between us,

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:19.880
please let it end.

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.600
Let's not bring it up.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.320
Sure thing.

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.960
I also don't want to talk about it.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.280
Who should be the next person?

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:52.200
(Teng: Do one for Phloeng!)

00:36:52.240 --> 00:37:00.240
(Taksin: Yes, please do one for Phloeng)

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:09.080
(Ing: Please read Phloeng's card)

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:13.760
(Nutin: @pntt Phloengggg)

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.800
He's probably working on a show.

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.880
That's enough.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.400
Please don't tag Phloeng.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:30.200
You're going to disturb him.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.480
(Ing: OMG!! Phloeng!)

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.176
(Prae: Phloeng's watching Win's live?
Didn't expect that!)

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.840
(tanatorn: He's really here!)

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.480
(Tu: Phloeng is here?! I can't!)

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.440
(Pom: I've never seen
him watch anyone's live)

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.600
(Chor: Phloeng's
watching the live?! Ahh!!)

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.240
(Pop: I feel blessed)

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.680
Hello, Phloeng.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.120
Well...

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.560
Am I troubling you?

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.240
Well...

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.800
If I am, it's okay.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:15.640
(pntt: Kinda)

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:18.920
(pntt: But since you're like this,
I think I can stay for a while)

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.520
(Nadech: UGHHDHSGSG!)

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.000
(sutep: w-wwhat?)

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.320
(Pitha: Ships are sailing,
I don't mind going to hell.)

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.816
(Nuthin: Don't do thisss.
(I'm a shipper, i can't stop my mind)

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:33.680
(Hunsen: I canttt!
(My heart's skipping the beat))

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:36.200
(Tukky: #PloengWin?)

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:39.480
(Teng: my ghost ship's on)

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.840
If that's the case,

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.800
meditate and open your mind.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.480
May your guardian angel
reveal your destiny.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.200
I'll do a reading on your personal card.

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.520
(pntt: I'm getting ready)

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.776
(nam: Pls don't say so politely TT)

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.136
(Pro: My heart's meltin...
(How come you guys say Phloeng's hot?)

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.456
(Pro: Phloeng on the master's live
is 100x hotter!)

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:58.896
(Pita: Why are you so polite? I just can'ttt)

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.376
(Ing: Can u facetime him? Wanna see both!)

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.800
(Pita: Facetime himmmm)

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.280
(nammm: plsss ft him)

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.080
(Tukky: Facetime! Facetime!)

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.960
(Nuthin: Video calling him noww)

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.080
Well...

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:26.840
I do not accept either
audio or video calls during livestreams.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.400
No more shipping us.
(Ing: Ooh master's explanation is spot on!)

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:33.056
Phloengnathitorn and I are
(Tuu: Live's ending? I'm too late)

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:36.400
just working together
on 'Spooky Hellish Night.'

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.720
So please...

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.400
(pntt: Sweet dreams)

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.600
What?!

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.000
How did that happen?

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:46.880
I accidentally tapped it.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.320
Yes?

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.480
Well...

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:52.840
I guess we're doing a video call.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.960
Your cards are...

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.440
excellent.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.680
The Emperor represents power.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:23.640
The Sun represents prosperity.

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.560
With the two combined,

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:29.920
it means that you have a lot of patrons.

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.480
Death, however,

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.560
has two meanings.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.800
It represents two things.

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.480
The first one is...

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:39.640
You're having terrible luck.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:43.120
When paired with The Emperor

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:44.840
and The Sun,

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.000
it means that
your good fortune is resilient,

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.760
even more so
than Captain America's shield.

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:51.880
Is that it?

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:52.960
That's it.

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.000
Here's a question.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.040
Yes?

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:57.720
What's the point?

00:40:59.120 --> 00:40:59.960
Well...

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.640
Knowing what your personal card is...

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:04.640
It's like...

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.960
It's basically your significator card.

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.640
For your subsequent readings,

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:13.440
let's say The Sun
is your significator card...

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:17.280
Look at it
alongside the two accompanying cards,

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.320
and you'll be able to know

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:23.560
who, when, or what

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:26.040
will be coming your way.

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:30.600
To put it simply, here's an example.

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.760
Here's The Knight of Pentacles.

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:43.600
It represents investment and cycles.

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.480
The Sun represents you.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:50.320
The Eight of Pentacles
represents your unique skills.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.440
When the three are combined,
it means that

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:56.640
you have plans to start a business

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.800
that requires such skills.

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:00.960
The reading suggests you go for it.

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.280
That's it for me, guys.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.760
We've done quite a lot, haven't we?

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:15.200
(pntt: Sweet dreams)

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.520
I have to end the livestream now.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.720
Have a good one, guys.

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:20.960
Take care of yourselves

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.640
and don't stay up for too long.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:28.520
(pntt: Sweet dreams)

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:32.120
You look so natural,

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.320
and that's lovely.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.320
I'm no longer interested in you.

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:36.920
I'm going to claim Win as mine.

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:38.800
You're actually not that hot, you know?

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.280
She visited a fortune teller

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:43.096
and was told
to get an offering for the shrine.

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.040
These are for ghosts, I'm sure.

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.040
Don't think that
being with a highly virtuous soul

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:47.640
would protect you from me.

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:49.040
The ones around you

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:50.120
will be dead.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:50.960
Hey!

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000
Chakart!

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:55.296
Luck hasn't been on your side, has it?

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:56.616
If you're afraid of ghosts tonight,

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:57.640
stay in my room, okay?
