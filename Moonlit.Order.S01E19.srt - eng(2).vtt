Okay?

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.659
Okay.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.740
Gu Qianfu.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.659
How long do you plan to keep hiding?

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.180
Grand Tutor Zhou

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.060
made you a homeless cur,

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.099
hiding in fear

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:37.579
and wanted you dead.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.300
Don't you want to rebel?

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:41.859
Who's winning?

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:42.900
Probably me.

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:49.539
I already know you're a couple.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.139
Don't lovey-dovey here.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.659
Gu Qianfu.

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:57.579
What did Grand Tutor Zhou promise you

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.099
to earn such blind loyalty?

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:00.940
My relationship with him

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.379
is a secret.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:05.539
He will

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.699
summon me again.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.460
Summon you?

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.620
From your fake death until now,

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.460
you've been begging.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.819
He summoned you?

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:18.500
You survived last time,

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.940
but there might not be a next time.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.620
Have you ever heard of

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:24.259
any Grand Tutor Zhou's men

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:26.539
who met a good end?

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.300
How can you be so stubborn?

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:31.780
He's been cutting your salary.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.340
How much longer

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:34.379
can you endure?

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.020
Not only are you broke,

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:38.900
but you're begging here.

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:41.340
They even withheld your

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:42.220
3,000 liang pension.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.419
Pathetic!

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:44.020
Enough!

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:46.259
This wretched state I'm in

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:49.139
is all thanks to Grand Tutor Zhou.

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:51.259
I'll expose him.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.379
Mr. Immortal the Emperor trusts

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.259
is Xue Youshou.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.060
Can you share something

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.340
we don't know?

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:15.740
I first met Xue Youshou

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.660
at the Grand Tutor's Mansion

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.259
two years ago.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.459
Surprised, right?

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.139
Two years ago?

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.060
Why could he

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.699
know Grand Tutor Zhou?

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:32.180
Impossible.

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:34.459
He's never told me.

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:36.500
Two years ago

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.180
was when I first met Youshou.

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.379
Could he have already...

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.259
Let me finish.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.699
Two years ago,

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.379
Grand Tutor Zhou discovered

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.300
suspicious expenses
of 500 liang in the Xue Mansion.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.420
So,

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.060
he sent me south to investigate.

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:57.980
I tracked down

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:00.259
and found Xue Youshou.

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:02.540
He was

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.540
putting on

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:04.980
mystical airs.

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:07.620
No matter what,

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:09.180
I brought him back

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.459
for the Grand Tutor.

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.940
Soon after,

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:16.139
an immortal

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:18.740
appeared in the palace.

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:22.740
It's Xue Youshou himself.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.259
Before Grand Tutor Zhou
tried to kill you,

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.459
did he act strangely?

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.819
First,

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.980
he sent people after you.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:37.339
Second,

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:39.300
recently,

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:41.019
when Feng Zuoren went south

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:42.660
to find the former Crown Prince,

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.740
Grand Tutor Zhou sent me too.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.019
I discovered

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.620
it was Xue Youshou again.

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:03.180
So I brought him back
to the Grand Tutor.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.139
Guess what?

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:07.139
Grand Tutor Zhou

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.379
kept it secret.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.980
Third,

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:16.219
I saw

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:19.860
Xue Youshou visiting
the Grand Tutor Zhou,

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.540
saying something like,

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:24.860
"Proceed with the plan."

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:41.980
Proceed with the plan.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:46.259
Then,

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:49.300
I got hunted down.

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:54.019
Grand Tutor Zhou is colluding

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.540
with Young Master?

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.579
Are you just making up a story

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:01.819
as you hate Grand Tutor?

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.379
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:11.819
(Xue Youshou falsely claimed
to be Young Master,)

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:14.779
(now he's colluding
with Grand Tutor Zhou.)

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:16.579
(What's his real motive?)

00:07:20.459 --> 00:07:21.860
She obtained the elixirs I made.

00:07:24.579 --> 00:07:25.540
You're insane!

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.339
Do you know her relationship
with the Emperor?

00:07:29.459 --> 00:07:29.980
Grand Tutor.

00:07:31.019 --> 00:07:32.620
She has principles and boundaries.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.060
We lack

00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:36.339
these qualities.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.459
You're still defending her
at this point?

00:07:39.899 --> 00:07:41.180
Have you fallen for her?

00:07:41.459 --> 00:07:42.100
I'm not blind.

00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:43.620
Rest assured.

00:07:44.579 --> 00:07:45.860
Whether she's willing or not,

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.300
she'll help us.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:01.860
Your Majesty.

00:08:02.219 --> 00:08:04.860
This is red date congee
prepared by the imperial chefs.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.339
With astragalus, angelica,

00:08:07.459 --> 00:08:08.860
longan, and red dates.

00:08:09.139 --> 00:08:11.100
Formulated to regulate your digestion

00:08:11.379 --> 00:08:12.699
and nourish qi and blood.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.660
To strengthen your energy,

00:08:15.339 --> 00:08:18.660
I present three Crimson Pills.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.620
Your Majesty, please take one pill daily.

00:08:23.019 --> 00:08:25.139
They prolong life.

00:08:26.819 --> 00:08:29.420
The congee and Crimson Pills

00:08:30.019 --> 00:08:32.140
have opposing thermal properties,

00:08:32.619 --> 00:08:33.819
counteracting each other.

00:08:34.339 --> 00:08:36.339
Long-term combined use

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.380
will damage internal organs

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:40.619
and cause poisoning.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.819
(That's why they're not afraid
of me testing the pills.)

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.699
(Imperial chefs work for him.)

00:08:52.459 --> 00:08:54.579
Young Master and Grand Tutor Zhou

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.260
want to assassinate His Majesty?

00:08:58.780 --> 00:08:59.499
Good try.

00:09:03.499 --> 00:09:05.260
His elaborate schemes

00:09:05.579 --> 00:09:06.219
must be

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.499
for greater benefits.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:10.900
Makes sense.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:20.660
Feng Zuoren.

00:09:21.339 --> 00:09:22.180
Can't figure it out?

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.540
Ask yourself honestly,

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.060
if this

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.619
involved someone else,

00:09:31.459 --> 00:09:32.699
would you persist like this?

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:33.780
Exactly.

00:09:40.459 --> 00:09:40.940
Forget it.

00:09:41.579 --> 00:09:42.099
Never mind.

00:09:42.339 --> 00:09:43.060
You figure it out.

00:09:45.859 --> 00:09:46.499
Why leaving?

00:09:48.699 --> 00:09:49.940
Let's talk this through.

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.619
Investigate whether

00:09:58.579 --> 00:10:00.940
that person is truly dead.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:02.579
Otherwise,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.060
she wouldn't suspect me.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.940
My men aren't fools.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.020
Their work

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.260
is flawless.

00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:13.619
Good then.

00:10:15.004 --> 00:10:19.144
(Establish Highest Standards)

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.459
The Huaixi flood report

00:10:22.579 --> 00:10:23.819
took three days

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.140
to reach me.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:26.540
Three days!

00:10:26.739 --> 00:10:28.260
How many lives were lost in delay?

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.060
Even if I execute
all negligent officials now,

00:10:32.219 --> 00:10:33.260
it wouldn't ease

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.900
this rage in my mind.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:40.540
Listen.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.300
Huaixi's taxes next year

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.579
are fully exempt.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:49.900
Yes.

00:10:58.819 --> 00:10:59.940
Why would I be mad at her?

00:11:00.819 --> 00:11:03.020
She defends Young Master,
it means defends me.

00:11:03.459 --> 00:11:04.060
Why be jealous?

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:05.499
Nothing.

00:11:06.339 --> 00:11:06.819
I'm jealous?

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:07.900
I'm jealous?

00:11:08.339 --> 00:11:08.900
She's jealous?

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.420
Impossible!

00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:12.900
Young Master.

00:11:14.699 --> 00:11:15.579
The night is cold,

00:11:15.979 --> 00:11:16.819
wear more.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:17.979
No need.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.060
- Come on.
- Miss Hua.

00:11:19.499 --> 00:11:20.300
It's improper.

00:11:20.859 --> 00:11:21.739
Really.

00:11:21.819 --> 00:11:22.420
Put it on.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.420
Keep our distance.

00:11:27.699 --> 00:11:28.660
- No need.
- It's cold.

00:11:29.219 --> 00:11:30.060
- Young Master.
- No need.

00:11:30.099 --> 00:11:30.780
Put it on.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.219
(With great martial arts,)

00:11:32.339 --> 00:11:33.339
(being loyal)

00:11:33.339 --> 00:11:34.300
(and righteous,)

00:11:35.099 --> 00:11:36.699
(why would I remain single)

00:11:37.099 --> 00:11:38.420
(for years?)

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.819
While, this playboy

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:42.819
can enjoy

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.499
female company.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:45.699
What if you catch a cold?

00:11:46.619 --> 00:11:47.979
Outrageous!

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:49.660
No need!

00:11:50.739 --> 00:11:51.540
- No!
- Wear this.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:52.459
Mr. Gu!

00:11:53.739 --> 00:11:55.099
Mr. Gu, you finally came.

00:11:55.459 --> 00:11:55.859
Let's go.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:56.579
Wait.

00:11:57.699 --> 00:11:59.060
Miss Hua, Mr. Gu is weak.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.140
Put it on him.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:03.300
Look!

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:04.940
He is so frail.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:06.940
Are you insane?

00:12:09.499 --> 00:12:10.619
Just a coat...

00:12:10.979 --> 00:12:12.579
The weather isn't that cold.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.339
Wearing many makes you sweat.

00:12:14.739 --> 00:12:15.900
Who wants it?

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.540
As the Chief of Jing'an Bureau,

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.180
I get neither affection nor care,

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:24.140
even have to hide like a fugitive.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:26.339
This is unjust!

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.140
We're the same.

00:12:27.219 --> 00:12:29.020
I'm like the dead,
and also need to hide.

00:12:29.819 --> 00:12:31.219
You are not dead.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.339
The dead don't chatter.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:33.499
Stop!

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.060
I'm nothing like the dead.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:35.859
If I died,

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.140
I'd talk a lot more.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:39.140
Anyway,

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.979
as ones feigning death,

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.699
we share a peculiar fate.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.099
If you're so destined,

00:12:46.619 --> 00:12:47.859
why not just

00:12:48.099 --> 00:12:48.979
die together?

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.060
Mr. Gu, you're amazing!

00:12:59.180 --> 00:12:59.699
Get off me.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:00.459
You two!

00:13:00.619 --> 00:13:01.459
You act indecisively,

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.260
even during the matchmaking session.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:04.420
And you,

00:13:04.819 --> 00:13:06.540
so talkative, always chatting.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.420
I've wanted to kill you both.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.260
Your identity is fake?

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:11.180
I...

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.099
You've been bribed!

00:13:12.499 --> 00:13:12.780
He...

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:13.739
Enough talk!

00:13:14.739 --> 00:13:15.499
Mark my words.

00:13:15.619 --> 00:13:16.739
Today is your last day.

00:13:16.859 --> 00:13:17.859
What did you say?

00:13:18.099 --> 00:13:20.020
Daring to challenge me?

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.660
I don't scare

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:23.579
a two-liang assassin.

00:13:24.579 --> 00:13:25.459
You!

00:13:25.859 --> 00:13:26.940
Xue Hexu, you go first!

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:27.619
Don't mind me.

00:13:34.339 --> 00:13:34.940
You're leaving?

00:13:35.499 --> 00:13:36.579
At least pretend to stay.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:41.300
Good for you.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:41.979
I had to.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:46.140
One each.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:48.819
What's wrong?

00:14:00.219 --> 00:14:01.619
Old Zhang, you can speak.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.060
I only speak to the dead.

00:14:59.699 --> 00:15:01.420
Let me show you

00:15:01.979 --> 00:15:04.540
a two-liang assassin's true power.

00:15:10.219 --> 00:15:10.900
Help!

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:12.540
Xue Hexu!

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:13.819
Help!

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:23.900
Get up.

00:15:24.739 --> 00:15:25.140
Come.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.140
Are you hurt?

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:30.579
Jade pendant.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:31.699
I remember now.

00:15:32.099 --> 00:15:32.660
Xue Hexu.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.099
Xue Hexu stole my jade pendant.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:34.579
What?

00:15:34.579 --> 00:15:35.260
Xue Hexu...

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.300
Xue Hexu stole Xue Hexu's jade pendant?

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:50.300
Xue Hexu.

00:15:57.499 --> 00:15:58.060
Feng.

00:16:03.859 --> 00:16:04.459
Cherry...

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.499
The cherry trees bloom,

00:16:09.739 --> 00:16:10.739
yet I can't plant

00:16:11.739 --> 00:16:13.300
a cherry tree for you.

00:16:15.739 --> 00:16:16.300
All I can do

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.699
is to paint you blossoms...

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.739
Brew cherry blossom wine,

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:23.819
and

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.979
make cherry blossom cakes.

00:16:27.819 --> 00:16:28.979
I'll paint pink petals

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:30.140
on...

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.699
on the kite for you.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.339
When it soars high...

00:16:38.459 --> 00:16:39.739
- It's like cherry blossoms dancing.
- It's like cherry blossoms dancing.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.060
Why do you know my conversation

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:48.900
with Young Master?

00:16:49.459 --> 00:16:50.020
That year,

00:16:52.699 --> 00:16:54.180
we hid in the study.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:55.380
I

00:16:56.739 --> 00:16:57.699
told you to bite my hand

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.499
if you're scared.

00:17:07.499 --> 00:17:09.299
I'm scared.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.459
Bite my hand if you're scared.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.128
♪But never yourself♪

00:17:17.128 --> 00:17:20.751
♪I'll become an observer♪

00:17:21.113 --> 00:17:28.481
♪A nod brings death,
but a smile could revive♪

00:17:30.259 --> 00:17:32.380
The view outside is beautiful.

00:17:32.739 --> 00:17:33.979
Be careful, Feng.

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:35.900
Climb up, and we can

00:17:36.019 --> 00:17:37.180
see the view outside.

00:17:37.979 --> 00:17:38.580
Join me.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.779
Are you okay?

00:18:01.779 --> 00:18:02.580
It is all my fault

00:18:02.779 --> 00:18:03.900
for ruining the jade pendant

00:18:03.979 --> 00:18:06.420
your father left you.

00:18:07.219 --> 00:18:08.299
Just a jade pendant.

00:18:08.499 --> 00:18:09.059
Don't mind it.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:13.940
Keep this.

00:18:14.499 --> 00:18:15.140
Now we each

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:16.739
have one piece.

00:18:17.059 --> 00:18:18.952
If we separate, we could
recognize each other.

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.979
We'll never separate.

00:18:28.499 --> 00:18:31.900
(After Emperor Jia ascended the throne,
Mother moved to the secluded manor)

00:18:32.699 --> 00:18:33.340
(with me,)

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.580
(trying to reassure)

00:18:35.259 --> 00:18:36.219
(Emperor Jia.)

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:38.900
(She believed this)

00:18:39.299 --> 00:18:40.499
(could make him spare me.)

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.180
(Within those walls,)

00:18:42.779 --> 00:18:43.940
(you were my only friend.)

00:18:45.299 --> 00:18:47.219
(Yet Emperor Jia didn't let me off.)

00:18:47.699 --> 00:18:49.100
(Feng)
(He sent assassins)

00:18:49.499 --> 00:18:50.779
(to eliminate us all.)

00:19:06.499 --> 00:19:07.059
Release me!

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:08.940
How dare you!

00:19:12.259 --> 00:19:13.699
Behave, little prince.

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:17.499
Wait!

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:23.900
What now?

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:25.660
He's my catch.

00:19:26.019 --> 00:19:27.660
I captured him first.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:28.779
Come with me.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:30.140
Enough!

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:31.340
We should

00:19:31.459 --> 00:19:32.660
kill him for our reward first.

00:19:34.019 --> 00:19:34.420
Deal.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:38.219
Bro,

00:19:38.459 --> 00:19:39.459
you promised

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.219
to spare me if I told you

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:42.180
where the gold is.

00:19:42.299 --> 00:19:43.539
Now betraying your word?

00:19:44.699 --> 00:19:46.140
What? Where?

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.140
I don't know.

00:19:48.739 --> 00:19:49.739
He's lying.

00:19:49.979 --> 00:19:51.059
Playing you for a fool.

00:19:51.299 --> 00:19:52.180
I see.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.140
You want to keep it to yourself.

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:55.820
You can kill me,

00:19:55.979 --> 00:19:57.100
but can't lie to your buddy.

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:58.180
Nonsense!

00:19:58.539 --> 00:20:00.299
Even a child can
see through your schemes.

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:01.699
Where's the gold?

00:20:01.779 --> 00:20:04.019
I told you I don't know.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.180
Bro, I'll tell you

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:09.299
if you spare me.

00:20:10.219 --> 00:20:10.620
Come on.

00:20:14.779 --> 00:20:16.180
Okay. Now release me.

00:20:16.979 --> 00:20:17.779
What was that?

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:19.259
Didn't catch that.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:20.340
Wait.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.219
You didn't catch that

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.100
or pretended to not catch that?

00:20:25.539 --> 00:20:26.739
You traitor!

00:20:27.019 --> 00:20:28.580
You're the real traitor!

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.059
Tell me where the gold is.

00:20:30.259 --> 00:20:31.459
We're buddies,

00:20:31.699 --> 00:20:33.019
and you suspect me,

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.019
thinking I'd betray you?

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:35.620
I...

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.580
Don't kill each other.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:39.259
If one dies,

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.140
the survivor takes all gold.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.100
Gold...

00:20:42.699 --> 00:20:43.219
I...

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:46.739
Sorry, bro.

00:20:47.299 --> 00:20:47.779
You!

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:48.620
Stop it!

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:53.768
Your Highness.

00:20:56.299 --> 00:20:57.420
(Young Xue Fugui)
Sorry for being late.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:58.620
Follow me.

00:20:58.820 --> 00:20:59.219
No!

00:20:59.380 --> 00:20:59.860
Follow me.

00:21:00.459 --> 00:21:00.900
Go!

00:21:08.779 --> 00:21:11.580
Your Highness, from now on,

00:21:12.259 --> 00:21:13.180
you'll settle here

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:14.739
for now.

00:21:30.019 --> 00:21:30.739
I'm Jia Xun.

00:21:33.299 --> 00:21:34.380
I'm Hexu.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:36.459
Jia Xun,

00:21:37.059 --> 00:21:38.660
this jade pendant is beautiful.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:40.140
Can you give it to me?

00:21:41.019 --> 00:21:42.100
I can give you anything,

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:45.539
but not this. It's the token
between Feng and me.

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:47.499
Who's Feng?

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.340
Feng is my best friend,

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.019
but we got separated.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:56.900
I'm your best friend too.

00:21:57.059 --> 00:21:58.499
I play with you every day.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:21:59.499
Give me.

00:21:59.499 --> 00:22:00.580
No way. Give it back.

00:22:01.739 --> 00:22:02.699
Give me.

00:22:14.299 --> 00:22:14.860
How's it?

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:16.940
Are you okay?

00:22:19.019 --> 00:22:19.900
Who are you?

00:22:21.739 --> 00:22:22.699
Who am I?

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:24.779
Where am I?

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:31.720
(He lost his memories.)

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:39.539
You're my son,

00:22:40.299 --> 00:22:41.100
Xue Hexu.

00:22:42.299 --> 00:22:43.340
You fell into the water,

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:44.860
and we rescued you.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:45.699
Safe now.

00:22:47.459 --> 00:22:47.979
Father?

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.259
(From that day on,)

00:22:53.499 --> 00:22:54.860
(I became Xue Hexu,)

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.380
(while the real Xue Hexu)

00:22:58.979 --> 00:23:00.620
(was forced into shadows)

00:23:01.739 --> 00:23:02.499
(as Jia Xun.)

00:23:12.699 --> 00:23:13.219
I am

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.299
the real former Crown Prince,

00:23:16.739 --> 00:23:17.779
Jia Xun.

00:23:22.019 --> 00:23:23.219
The entire Xue family

00:23:24.059 --> 00:23:25.820
failed to recognize Xue Hexu.

00:23:27.059 --> 00:23:27.779
Remember?

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.340
When we checked the records,

00:23:29.499 --> 00:23:30.299
it said

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.820
Xue Hexu recuperated in the countryside

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:34.539
until age ten,

00:23:34.739 --> 00:23:36.259
before returning to Xue Mansion.

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:39.059
Dongyang's dementia made him oblivious.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.739
Xue Nuannuan was too young to notice.

00:23:42.779 --> 00:23:43.620
And Liu Jiaoqian

00:23:44.459 --> 00:23:45.820
married into the family later,

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:47.860
so she knew nothing of this.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:54.580
So...

00:23:58.380 --> 00:23:59.900
Even if we forgot each other,

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:01.180
fate

00:24:02.219 --> 00:24:03.580
would bring us together.

00:24:04.019 --> 00:24:04.900
and make us meet.
