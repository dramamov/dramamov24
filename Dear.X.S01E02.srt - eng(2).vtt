DEAR X

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:55.805
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.515
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:00.435
Mom.

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:01.895
I'm here to see you.

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:03.772
THE LATE LIM SUN YE

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:04.856
How is it up there?

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:06.608
Is it any better?

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:11.279
I'm doing just fine.

00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:16.493
This girl in my class
has been acting up.

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:18.703
She got on my nerves.

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:20.455
But it's fine.

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:25.043
I have something for you.

00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:26.336
Want to know what it is?

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:31.382
Was it at the start of the semester?

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.677
I had to turn in
an assignment for art class.

00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:37.931
I got the deadline wrong

00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:40.058
and had to turn it in incomplete.

00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:43.269
I went to my art teacher and said...

00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:45.063
"Sir.

00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:50.443
I was abused as a child.

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:52.904
I think my wrist is still weak.

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:57.075
I can't seem to finish my artwork.

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.411
I can't draw properly.

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:04.666
What should I do?"

00:02:07.168 --> 00:02:08.378
I mistakenly thought

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:12.215
he'd give me a good grade
if I said that.

00:02:13.174 --> 00:02:15.969
I'm not sure
if he really took pity on me

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:18.680
or if he saw through my lies.

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:20.723
He kept telling me
to see a psycholo--

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:21.808
Did you eat?

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:23.977
Hey.

00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:27.188
About what I said last time.

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:28.731
There's no pressure at all.

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.817
Just vent and release what's inside.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.193
TRUE LOVE COUNSELING CENTER

00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:33.278
Give them a call.

00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:38.074
He's an interesting guy.

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:45.957
I'll leave this here.

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:47.750
It's a gift.

00:02:48.793 --> 00:02:50.920
Get some counseling over in hell

00:02:52.046 --> 00:02:53.840
and be born again.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:55.967
Who knows?

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:57.510
In your next life

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:00.388
your daughter might save you.

00:03:01.472 --> 00:03:03.766
I won't ever live like you.

00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:08.521
I won't die like you, either.

00:03:10.398 --> 00:03:12.442
Watch from where you are

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:15.403
just how far I climb.

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:21.868
Then you'll feel less wronged
about how you died

00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:25.997
and your death will carry more value.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:39.719
JUNE 2007

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:47.018
GENERAL STORE

00:03:47.101 --> 00:03:48.102
Ah Jin.

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:51.940
Get me two bottles.

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:53.691
Go on.

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:16.047
You're the little thief
who's been stealing from me, right?

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:18.091
Where's your mom?

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:19.926
Goddamn it.

00:04:28.017 --> 00:04:29.018
Honey.

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.650
Are you taking me to an orphanage?

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.779
We'll live here from now on.

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:24.407
If you listen to your stepmom
and don't get in trouble

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.743
I'll let you stay here
until you grow up.

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:28.036
Will you really?

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:53.603
Hello.

00:06:04.113 --> 00:06:05.448
Jun Seo.

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:09.202
Say hello.

00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:11.329
He's your stepdad who just moved in.

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:12.789
Hi.

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:31.808
Hi.

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:33.476
I'm Baek Ah Jin.

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:36.479
Hi, I'm Yoon Jun Seo.

00:06:36.562 --> 00:06:38.773
All the assets that Jun Seo will get.

00:06:38.856 --> 00:06:41.317
I told the darned old man
I'd manage it all

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:44.320
but the old fool won't listen.

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:46.864
There are more mouths to feed.

00:06:48.282 --> 00:06:50.368
I won't make much
from selling this place.

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:52.453
Do you have any ideas?

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:06.342
Just you wait.

00:07:07.176 --> 00:07:09.595
We can make a fortune with the girl.

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:11.764
She's worth quite a bit.

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:14.809
Sell a few videos of her

00:07:15.768 --> 00:07:18.229
and we can move to a penthouse
overlooking the Hangang River.

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:20.982
That video you speak of.

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:24.777
We'll take a few
then ship her off to an orphanage.

00:07:25.486 --> 00:07:26.487
You bet.

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:31.492
You'll be better off
if you don't upset her.

00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:36.372
She has her dead mom's dirty temper.

00:07:37.915 --> 00:07:39.625
She'll just gnaw you to bits.

00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:43.629
I'm not some meat on the bone.
Why would she gnaw me?

00:07:54.140 --> 00:08:01.063
EPISODE 2:
THE MOMENT A HUMAN BECOMES A DEVIL

00:08:09.697 --> 00:08:10.698
Keep the rest.

00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:15.536
Oh, I haven't been here in a while.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.372
SINGWANG HIGH SCHOOL

00:08:20.708 --> 00:08:22.627
I said no.

00:08:23.002 --> 00:08:25.087
If people find out
you slept with my English teacher

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:27.548
I'll be too embarrassed
to stay in school!

00:08:29.258 --> 00:08:30.259
Whatever.

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:32.386
I'm dropping out, and that's that.

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:34.889
Hello?

00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:37.266
I'm looking for my daughter's school.

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:39.644
It must be somewhere here

00:08:39.727 --> 00:08:41.479
but I can't tell
because I don't know where she lives.

00:08:42.271 --> 00:08:44.357
I was thinking
of squeezing her for money.

00:08:46.817 --> 00:08:48.361
You remember my Ah Jin, right?

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:51.155
- Baek Ah Jin?
- She has one pretty face.

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:53.491
She takes after me, Baek Seon Gyu.

00:08:53.574 --> 00:08:54.867
It's in her blood.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:56.786
Excuse me.

00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:03.084
Did you just say
your daughter's Baek Ah Jin?

00:09:03.167 --> 00:09:04.627
I'll call you later.

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:07.338
Do you know Ah Jin?

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:08.756
I'm her dad.

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:11.717
Is she better off being an orphan?

00:09:13.761 --> 00:09:14.845
Why is she an orphan?

00:09:15.179 --> 00:09:16.180
It's Sim Sung Hee's notebook.

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:17.557
SIM SUNG HEE

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.894
She noted everyone's grades,
parents' jobs, and living standards.

00:09:22.603 --> 00:09:24.981
Everyone's graded
between A-plus and D.

00:09:26.315 --> 00:09:28.526
Anyone below B,
she scratched out in red.

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:36.576
It's insane.
The kids would kill her if they knew.

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:37.785
BAEK AH JIN, C-MINUS
YOON JUN SEO, A-PLUS

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:41.706
Hey, what's an "Un..."

00:09:41.789 --> 00:09:42.999
KIM JAE OH, D
AN UNTOUCHABLE

00:09:43.082 --> 00:09:44.083
"Untouchable?"

00:09:44.667 --> 00:09:45.710
What does that mean?

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:47.712
It sounds nasty.

00:09:55.094 --> 00:09:56.095
Hello?

00:09:56.178 --> 00:09:58.055
Ah Jin, your dad's here.

00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:00.600
- Who's here?
- Your dad.

00:10:00.683 --> 00:10:02.268
- He's here looking for you.
- Ah Jin!

00:10:02.351 --> 00:10:03.686
At the first floor
central staircase--

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:06.063
Where are you off to?

00:10:06.939 --> 00:10:07.940
Baek Ah Jin!

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.075
Where are you, Jae Oh? I'm scared.

00:10:18.492 --> 00:10:20.578
Dad keeps calling me Satan.

00:10:20.661 --> 00:10:21.662
Come home soon.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.833
Ah Jin!

00:10:27.084 --> 00:10:28.252
Baek Ah Jin!

00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:30.171
Dad's here!

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:33.007
Baek Ah Jin!

00:10:33.507 --> 00:10:35.051
Guys, did you see Baek Ah Jin?

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:40.431
Her father is looking for her.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.683
Well? You haven't seen her?

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:44.435
Didn't she say she was an orphan?

00:10:44.935 --> 00:10:46.520
He's so weird. What's up with him?

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:47.605
Dad.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.233
Who is this weirdo?

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:52.943
Dad, come with me.

00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:58.324
Hey, Jun Seo.

00:10:58.866 --> 00:11:02.411
You go to this school, too?
You're all grown up.

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:04.372
Where's Ah Jin?

00:11:04.872 --> 00:11:05.956
Let's head out, Dad.

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:08.793
- Where's Ah Jin, you punk?
- I'll give you cash.

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:13.214
I'll give you money.

00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:19.261
Mister!

00:11:20.012 --> 00:11:21.931
You're not Jun Seo's dad.

00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:26.602
Anyone who lived with me
under the same roof is my son.

00:11:29.605 --> 00:11:31.065
- How have you been?
- Mister!

00:11:31.148 --> 00:11:32.274
Mister!

00:11:33.567 --> 00:11:34.735
She's psycho.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.327
- What was that about?
- Darn it.

00:11:44.328 --> 00:11:45.329
What's this?

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:48.874
- What is this?
- It looks funny.

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.334
It has your name.

00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:52.461
What kind of bitch would...

00:12:13.482 --> 00:12:16.902
SEO MI RI
CEO OF LONGSTAR ENTERTAINMENT

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.176
You didn't have to.

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:44.096
The condition is
that you never appear

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.098
near our school
or in front of Ah Jin.

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:50.227
Don't call even if you're dying
of a terminal illness.

00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:51.771
She's my daughter.

00:12:52.062 --> 00:12:54.565
A dad wants to see his daughter.
What's wrong with that?

00:12:54.648 --> 00:12:58.402
When a dad's in a bind,
he can ask his daughter for help.

00:12:58.652 --> 00:13:00.863
You arrogant bastard.

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:04.950
We can't sever our ties
just because you say so.

00:13:13.667 --> 00:13:16.086
I thought you'd say that,
so I only got you half.

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:19.507
If you stay away from Ah Jin
until she graduates

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:20.925
I'll give you the other half.

00:13:21.008 --> 00:13:22.676
She takes after me.

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:24.386
She has a pretty face.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.223
I can get at least two large
if I sell her off to a bar.

00:13:28.724 --> 00:13:30.976
I hope you keep your word.

00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:36.816
Why would you go
to such lengths for her?

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:38.609
You're complete strangers.

00:13:39.401 --> 00:13:42.696
You might not be related,
but you were step-siblings once.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:45.741
It's so nice to see you
look out for each other.

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:47.868
You're pretty loyal, unlike your mom.

00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:50.329
Is that all you have to say?

00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:53.374
Don't you feel bad for Ah Jin at all?

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.251
What are you on about?

00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:06.470
See you around, girlie.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:34.623
Are you Baek Ah Jin?

00:14:37.334 --> 00:14:38.335
Who are you?

00:14:44.675 --> 00:14:46.760
I'm Seo Mi Ri
from Longstar Entertainment.

00:14:47.636 --> 00:14:49.305
Would you like to be a celebrity?

00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:53.851
SEO MI RI

00:14:53.934 --> 00:14:55.227
You've heard of us, right?

00:14:56.645 --> 00:14:58.647
I'd love to make you an actress.

00:14:59.982 --> 00:15:00.983
No, thanks.

00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:03.068
Sorry.

00:15:06.196 --> 00:15:07.197
Wait.

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:11.827
Are you in talks with another agency?

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:17.708
I'd like to know
why you said no outright.

00:15:17.791 --> 00:15:19.293
I won't do anything like that.

00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:33.432
Where are you, Jae Oh?

00:15:33.515 --> 00:15:35.351
Hurry up!

00:15:44.735 --> 00:15:45.736
Dad...

00:15:46.362 --> 00:15:47.571
Dad...

00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:48.989
Dad!

00:15:49.698 --> 00:15:50.699
Satan.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:54.620
You're scheming
so you can possess my son.

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:56.705
You evil devil.

00:15:57.456 --> 00:15:58.624
- Get out of--
- Stop!

00:16:01.752 --> 00:16:04.338
Are you crazy?
How can do this to a kid?

00:16:04.922 --> 00:16:07.383
Dad, take it out on me instead.

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:08.842
Get the fuck off me.

00:16:12.846 --> 00:16:14.515
Please stop!

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:18.978
You fool.

00:16:19.061 --> 00:16:20.980
Dad, please listen to me!

00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:22.690
- Dad!
-Leave me alone!

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:31.991
Jae Oh.

00:16:38.414 --> 00:16:39.415
Dad...

00:17:06.066 --> 00:17:07.109
Jae Oh.

00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:30.299
Ah Jin.

00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:34.386
Are you all right?

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:39.141
There's no need
to let the past get to you.

00:17:40.184 --> 00:17:41.435
He'll stay away for a while.

00:17:41.518 --> 00:17:44.146
He will. For a while.

00:17:45.272 --> 00:17:46.482
Don't worry too much.

00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:50.360
I'll do it all.

00:17:51.779 --> 00:17:54.114
I won't ever allow
another situation...

00:17:56.366 --> 00:17:57.868
in which I can't do anything.

00:17:58.452 --> 00:17:59.912
Don't worry about your dad.

00:18:00.829 --> 00:18:03.457
He'll do anything for money,
so he was easy to handle.

00:18:10.798 --> 00:18:12.091
About Sim Sung Hee.

00:18:13.133 --> 00:18:15.219
How did she manage
to bring your dad to our school?

00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:17.721
Now he knows where to find you.

00:18:17.805 --> 00:18:19.014
I took care of her.

00:18:33.237 --> 00:18:34.363
What are you doing?

00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:36.240
I'll give you money.

00:18:40.035 --> 00:18:41.870
Do you think
we're after your fucking money?

00:18:42.371 --> 00:18:43.413
What is this?

00:18:43.497 --> 00:18:45.040
You're still all up
in other people's business.

00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:47.334
We beat you up in middle school,
but that wasn't enough?

00:18:47.751 --> 00:18:50.170
Why am I an untouchable?

00:18:50.254 --> 00:18:52.840
Why ask? It means you're dirt poor.

00:18:52.923 --> 00:18:53.924
You bitch.

00:18:54.007 --> 00:18:56.135
This won't do.
I'll beat you to death.

00:18:56.218 --> 00:18:58.720
You might actually get sentenced
for assault.

00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:00.973
- What are you saying?
- You're over 14!

00:19:01.056 --> 00:19:03.016
Shut your mouth, bitch.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.644
I'll just kill you then kill myself.

00:19:05.727 --> 00:19:06.812
How about that?

00:19:06.895 --> 00:19:10.607
My family is dirt poor,
and I have no damn future anyway.

00:19:10.691 --> 00:19:13.110
- Let's all go to prison together.
- To prison!

00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:21.910
Yes, Auntie.

00:19:22.369 --> 00:19:23.370
Kim Jae Oh.

00:19:23.954 --> 00:19:26.915
You can't send your brother over
at this time of night.

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:29.459
The taxi fare came out to 60,000 won.

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:32.504
Do you know how surprised we were?

00:19:34.089 --> 00:19:35.883
And why is he such a mess?

00:19:35.966 --> 00:19:38.177
- I was so--
- Take him to a hospital.

00:19:40.512 --> 00:19:42.014
He needs a guardian.

00:19:43.932 --> 00:19:45.184
I can't be there for him.

00:19:45.642 --> 00:19:46.643
What's wrong?

00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:48.395
What's going on?

00:19:51.982 --> 00:19:52.983
Auntie.

00:19:55.652 --> 00:19:56.653
Jae Hun...

00:19:59.156 --> 00:20:01.867
Look after him for me.

00:20:03.911 --> 00:20:05.329
He was badly beaten

00:20:07.122 --> 00:20:09.041
and he saw something
he shouldn't have.

00:20:10.584 --> 00:20:11.627
He'll be in shock.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.463
- Gosh, did your dad do something?
- I'm sorry, Auntie.

00:20:15.839 --> 00:20:16.840
Don't forgive me.

00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:22.095
I promise to pay...

00:20:24.348 --> 00:20:25.599
for what I did.

00:20:26.767 --> 00:20:28.644
Jae Oh, what on earth--

00:20:48.872 --> 00:20:49.873
What's up?

00:20:50.832 --> 00:20:51.833
You picked up.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.670
I tried calling one last time.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.923
What do you mean, "last time"?

00:20:58.215 --> 00:20:59.549
I killed that punk.

00:21:00.717 --> 00:21:01.802
What?

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:05.681
I stabbed him.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:07.891
He's dead.

00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:11.770
What you just said.

00:21:12.396 --> 00:21:13.397
Is it true?

00:21:13.689 --> 00:21:14.773
Was there a witness?

00:21:17.025 --> 00:21:18.485
I'm in front of the police station.

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:20.821
I'm going to turn myself in.

00:21:22.197 --> 00:21:23.490
I don't regret it, though.

00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:25.784
Pretend to regret it.

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:28.620
So people will pity you.

00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:34.084
Why?

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:37.045
Does the future law student think

00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:39.715
I'll rot in prison for a long time?

00:21:40.841 --> 00:21:41.842
Kim Jae Oh.

00:21:48.348 --> 00:21:49.641
Even if you go to prison

00:21:50.392 --> 00:21:53.979
you'll still be free since you've cut
the chain that was tying you down.

00:21:54.896 --> 00:21:56.523
What's important
is what happens next.

00:21:57.691 --> 00:21:59.651
You were a victim
before you were an assailant.

00:22:00.527 --> 00:22:01.778
Appeal with that.

00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:05.324
Cry, wail, and tremble,
and pretend to be remorseful.

00:22:07.075 --> 00:22:08.076
Do you get that?

00:22:11.288 --> 00:22:12.456
Baek Ah Jin.

00:22:15.792 --> 00:22:17.044
You're so weird.

00:22:20.672 --> 00:22:22.049
Thanks, though.

00:22:24.301 --> 00:22:26.219
I don't know
if that was meant to be comforting

00:22:27.804 --> 00:22:28.930
but thanks.

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:32.267
For talking in my favor
instead of criticizing me

00:22:33.226 --> 00:22:34.227
for killing someone.

00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:37.647
You're wrong, though.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:45.781
I am trash.

00:22:49.534 --> 00:22:51.119
I should hang up now.

00:22:52.746 --> 00:22:53.747
Take care.

00:22:56.291 --> 00:22:57.292
You were

00:22:58.668 --> 00:23:00.545
the only person
who said I was useful.

00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:04.216
Thanks for that.

00:23:06.385 --> 00:23:07.511
Look after yourself...

00:23:08.762 --> 00:23:09.763
Baek Ah Jin.

00:23:32.911 --> 00:23:36.415
Sim Sung Hee did all she could
to drag down Ah Jin.

00:23:37.791 --> 00:23:40.127
She transferred schools
in a hurry as if to flee.

00:23:42.963 --> 00:23:46.049
As no one ever got on
Ah Jin's nerves again...

00:23:48.635 --> 00:23:49.636
we got to enjoy

00:23:51.054 --> 00:23:54.015
the ordinary kind of life
every other teenager did.

00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:06.820
We lived in peace
as if God smiled upon us

00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:09.823
and a few more seasons passed.

00:24:16.079 --> 00:24:17.080
Ah Jin...

00:24:17.164 --> 00:24:18.248
2018 ADMISSION RESULTS

00:24:18.832 --> 00:24:20.834
...got into Hankook University's
Department of Law.

00:24:20.917 --> 00:24:22.794
BAEK AH JIN, SINGWANG HIGH,
DEPARTMENT OF LAW

00:24:22.878 --> 00:24:24.379
CONGRATULATIONS

00:24:24.838 --> 00:24:26.506
You're in! Yes!

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:28.550
How did you get
into Hankook University?

00:24:28.633 --> 00:24:30.469
DECEMBER 2017, ADMITTED
TO HANKOOK UNIVERSITY'S DEPT OF LAW

00:24:32.512 --> 00:24:33.513
Also...

00:24:33.597 --> 00:24:34.598
NOJEONG-DONG PATRICIDE

00:24:34.681 --> 00:24:38.143
...the Nojeong-dong patricide
that everyone talked about

00:24:38.894 --> 00:24:40.020
was soon forgotten.

00:24:40.103 --> 00:24:41.104
DEFENDANT

00:24:41.188 --> 00:24:43.690
We'll consider the jury's decision...

00:24:43.773 --> 00:24:45.275
Will you really study law?

00:24:49.237 --> 00:24:50.280
Once we graduate

00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:53.116
I'll never see you again.

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:55.535
Why? Do you want to see me?

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:03.793
Then quit stealing stuff
and get your life back on track.

00:25:05.128 --> 00:25:07.339
If and when you become
more useful than you are now

00:25:07.422 --> 00:25:09.007
I might have a use for you.

00:25:09.841 --> 00:25:11.176
Then we could meet again.

00:25:13.094 --> 00:25:15.639
What Baek Ah Jin said to me that day.

00:25:16.473 --> 00:25:18.225
Why does it come to mind today?

00:25:18.308 --> 00:25:21.645
The defendant's parents
should've protected him, but...

00:25:21.728 --> 00:25:22.812
Jae Oh.

00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:24.814
You're not useless.

00:25:25.774 --> 00:25:26.900
At least, not to me.

00:25:28.401 --> 00:25:31.321
Will I even get another chance?

00:25:32.239 --> 00:25:36.785
We also accept the fact
that it was an accidental death

00:25:36.868 --> 00:25:38.203
caused during a struggle

00:25:38.828 --> 00:25:42.332
in which the defendant protected
his brother who was being abused.

00:25:42.415 --> 00:25:46.211
I sentence you
to three to five years in prison.

00:25:46.294 --> 00:25:52.801
NOJEONG-DONG PATRICIDE
SENTENCED TO 3 TO 5 YEARS

00:25:54.094 --> 00:25:55.595
I won this time.

00:25:55.679 --> 00:25:56.680
All in.

00:26:12.487 --> 00:26:13.530
Fuck this!

00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:29.045
Welcome.

00:26:31.965 --> 00:26:33.008
A pack of cigarettes.

00:26:33.758 --> 00:26:37.345
Students can print their tuition bill
at their university's website...

00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:38.805
4,500 won, please.

00:26:41.891 --> 00:26:45.895
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR ACCEPTANCE

00:26:55.572 --> 00:26:57.657
Baek Ah Jin, Yoon Jun Seo.

00:26:57.741 --> 00:26:58.825
YOON JUN SEO, ANAM UNIVERSITY

00:27:05.332 --> 00:27:06.791
You want a loan?

00:27:12.714 --> 00:27:13.882
She's a friend of mine.

00:27:14.966 --> 00:27:16.968
She doesn't have enough
for her tuition.

00:27:17.427 --> 00:27:19.220
I'm in no position to help her.

00:27:20.013 --> 00:27:23.183
So what? You know your grandpa's rich

00:27:23.266 --> 00:27:24.976
and you want to be benevolent?

00:27:25.685 --> 00:27:27.395
No, lend it to me.

00:27:27.854 --> 00:27:29.230
Since I have no collateral

00:27:29.814 --> 00:27:32.359
if you agree to give me a loan,
I'll pay you back every cent

00:27:32.442 --> 00:27:35.862
at a higher interest rate
than what you charge your clients.

00:27:36.237 --> 00:27:38.948
You’re using our blood ties
as collateral

00:27:39.032 --> 00:27:40.283
but offering a higher interest
in return?

00:27:42.035 --> 00:27:43.787
It'll be pretty steep, then.

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:45.288
Do you have a way to pay me back?

00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:47.624
Yes, I'll find students to tutor

00:27:47.707 --> 00:27:49.501
and I'm looking for a part-time job.

00:27:51.336 --> 00:27:53.505
You'll have no time left to study.

00:27:54.297 --> 00:27:58.009
You know I travel to Japan
every two months for treatment.

00:27:58.093 --> 00:27:59.678
If you tag along

00:27:59.761 --> 00:28:03.139
for three days and two nights
as my secretary and guardian

00:28:03.223 --> 00:28:06.476
I can waive the interest. How's that?

00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:11.064
Okay, as a debtor,
I'll pay you back with interest

00:28:11.731 --> 00:28:13.733
and as a grandson,
I'll be your guardian.

00:28:14.317 --> 00:28:16.611
I offered a deal,
and you're making a donation.

00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:19.864
You're such a softie.

00:28:21.825 --> 00:28:23.993
We leave tomorrow. Get packing.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.455
Okay. Thank you, Grandfather.

00:28:39.884 --> 00:28:42.345
I smell money on you.
You look nicer, too.

00:28:43.054 --> 00:28:44.389
How did you find me?

00:28:48.143 --> 00:28:49.519
I'm Baek Seon Gyu.

00:28:52.772 --> 00:28:53.773
Is Jun Seo well?

00:28:55.692 --> 00:28:56.735
What do you want?

00:28:57.902 --> 00:28:59.654
Be nice.

00:29:03.992 --> 00:29:05.201
Where does Ah Jin live?

00:29:06.411 --> 00:29:07.871
Why ask me about your daughter?

00:29:08.663 --> 00:29:11.207
That's why I asked
about your son first.

00:29:12.375 --> 00:29:14.002
You know where she lives, don't you?

00:29:14.669 --> 00:29:15.670
I don't.

00:29:16.629 --> 00:29:18.715
I kept her for a few years
after you went to prison.

00:29:19.507 --> 00:29:21.009
She left of her own accord.

00:29:21.968 --> 00:29:24.053
You left the young girl
on the street?

00:29:24.929 --> 00:29:27.307
I have no obligation
to look after your kid.

00:29:29.476 --> 00:29:31.728
Jun Seo must know where she lives.

00:29:32.312 --> 00:29:34.481
They used to be step-siblings.

00:29:34.939 --> 00:29:36.608
Leave Jun Seo alone.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:42.947
He got into Anam University.

00:29:57.837 --> 00:30:01.466
MS BANK, BAEK AH JIN
1,577,900 WON

00:30:16.272 --> 00:30:17.357
Did I make you wait?

00:30:20.527 --> 00:30:22.278
- Two gukbap, please.
- Okay.

00:30:23.655 --> 00:30:24.948
Congratulations, Ah Jin.

00:30:25.031 --> 00:30:26.658
You got a scholarship.

00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:28.493
What are you on about?

00:30:28.576 --> 00:30:31.913
I applied for a scholarship for you,
and you got it just like that.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.001
Ta-da.

00:30:38.795 --> 00:30:40.713
My grandfather decided

00:30:40.797 --> 00:30:43.424
to start giving scholarships
to students this year.

00:30:43.758 --> 00:30:45.802
I raised my hand right away.

00:30:45.885 --> 00:30:48.388
Baek Ah Jin,
you're the first recipient.

00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:50.557
Isn't it a huge honor?

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:57.397
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

00:30:59.899 --> 00:31:01.776
Did you ask your grandfather?

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:04.863
What did you agree to do in return?

00:31:04.946 --> 00:31:05.947
Be a good grandson.

00:31:06.739 --> 00:31:09.158
He regularly goes to Japan
for treatment.

00:31:09.576 --> 00:31:11.160
He asked me to tag along this time.

00:31:11.452 --> 00:31:14.789
I decided to be
the best grandson I can be.

00:31:16.291 --> 00:31:17.292
Jun Seo.

00:31:18.293 --> 00:31:20.086
Don't you think this is still...

00:31:20.169 --> 00:31:23.506
I know what you're thinking,
but your enrollment comes first.

00:31:23.882 --> 00:31:26.885
Let's think about the rest
when you achieve your dream.

00:31:27.176 --> 00:31:28.887
Wait until after that. Okay?

00:31:33.725 --> 00:31:35.727
Let's eat. This looks amazing.

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:10.511
Peekaboo.

00:32:11.012 --> 00:32:12.096
Dad's here.

00:32:13.264 --> 00:32:14.891
Get lost before I call the cops.

00:32:18.227 --> 00:32:20.813
It's not a crime for a dad
to visit his daughter.

00:32:22.732 --> 00:32:25.234
You want to study law
when you lack common knowledge?

00:32:25.318 --> 00:32:26.486
Give up.

00:32:29.155 --> 00:32:30.156
I need money.

00:32:32.533 --> 00:32:33.910
I don't have any.

00:32:33.993 --> 00:32:35.954
Where's the money you made
working day and night?

00:32:37.121 --> 00:32:38.539
You must have enough for tuition.

00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:40.208
It's not at home.

00:32:42.168 --> 00:32:43.419
Is it in there?

00:32:44.921 --> 00:32:46.381
It must be in here.

00:32:46.756 --> 00:32:47.757
Hand it over.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:48.841
Get away.

00:32:51.219 --> 00:32:52.345
This bitch.

00:32:58.851 --> 00:33:01.437
Are you crazy?
Have you lost your mind?

00:33:04.023 --> 00:33:05.149
You're insane.

00:33:06.109 --> 00:33:07.151
Damn it.

00:33:10.154 --> 00:33:12.991
It's not safe to carry cash around.

00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:16.327
Why, you...

00:33:23.418 --> 00:33:24.419
You're crazy.

00:33:24.961 --> 00:33:26.713
You're out of your mind.

00:33:26.796 --> 00:33:29.132
You're insane. Totally mad.

00:33:56.451 --> 00:33:57.618
Ah Jin.

00:34:00.204 --> 00:34:01.205
Ah Jin?

00:34:07.545 --> 00:34:08.546
Ah Jin.

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:17.680
What is it?

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:19.390
Is something wrong?

00:34:20.516 --> 00:34:22.351
I'm sick.

00:34:23.811 --> 00:34:25.521
I think I caught a cold.

00:34:26.939 --> 00:34:29.192
Tell your mom, then.

00:34:30.151 --> 00:34:31.569
I told her.

00:34:32.487 --> 00:34:33.738
But she told me to sleep.

00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:36.449
Go and lie in bed.

00:34:36.783 --> 00:34:38.618
I'll find you some medicine.

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.551
I couldn't find the medicine.

00:34:56.594 --> 00:34:59.138
But I'll stay with you
until you fall asleep.

00:35:01.182 --> 00:35:02.600
Thank you, Ah Jin.

00:35:03.768 --> 00:35:05.561
- Jun Seo.
- Yeah?

00:35:06.062 --> 00:35:09.232
You don't look like your mom at all.

00:35:09.315 --> 00:35:10.316
You're wrong.

00:35:11.234 --> 00:35:12.693
Hang on.

00:35:23.871 --> 00:35:26.124
Take a look. Don't we look alike?

00:35:26.916 --> 00:35:28.376
Who's this man here?

00:35:28.835 --> 00:35:30.878
That's Mr. Kang the chauffeur.

00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:34.924
He used to drive my dad around.

00:35:35.007 --> 00:35:38.719
He moved to another country
after Dad died.

00:35:39.512 --> 00:35:42.849
I cried so much because he left
without saying goodbye.

00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:52.400
Ah Jin.

00:35:52.775 --> 00:35:55.611
I have to take Jun Seo
to see a doctor.

00:35:55.695 --> 00:35:58.239
Will you take this to his mom
when she wakes up?

00:35:58.698 --> 00:35:59.907
- Okay.
- Thank you.

00:36:00.658 --> 00:36:01.659
Let's go.

00:36:18.551 --> 00:36:20.720
Jun Seo just left to see a doctor.

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:25.683
I'm saying
it's just you and me at home.

00:36:27.185 --> 00:36:28.352
What do you want?

00:36:29.312 --> 00:36:30.855
I didn't say you could come in.

00:36:32.648 --> 00:36:36.903
Last night, Jun Seo showed me
a photo of his dad.

00:36:39.572 --> 00:36:41.616
He must've missed him
because he didn't feel well.

00:36:43.659 --> 00:36:45.203
But Ms. Hwang.

00:36:45.995 --> 00:36:47.580
Jun Seo's real dad.

00:36:48.372 --> 00:36:50.708
Why did he move abroad
without saying goodbye?

00:36:59.467 --> 00:37:02.261
What did you just say?

00:37:03.137 --> 00:37:04.847
Jun Seo's real dad did what?

00:37:05.973 --> 00:37:06.974
Said who?

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.186
Did Jun Seo say so?

00:37:12.355 --> 00:37:16.025
It's funny to see you
get serious so suddenly.

00:37:16.943 --> 00:37:18.653
I was just joking.

00:37:19.779 --> 00:37:21.989
Jun Seo's real dad
didn't move abroad.

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.867
Mr. Kang the chauffeur did.

00:37:26.994 --> 00:37:27.995
Ms. Hwang.

00:37:29.163 --> 00:37:31.290
I just figured out your secret.

00:37:32.625 --> 00:37:34.168
Jun Seo doesn't know yet.

00:37:34.877 --> 00:37:38.381
But what would happen
if he were to find out?

00:37:39.507 --> 00:37:40.925
Forget about that.

00:37:41.008 --> 00:37:43.302
What if his grandfather were to know?

00:37:48.891 --> 00:37:50.268
Are you blackmailing me?

00:37:52.144 --> 00:37:54.563
How dare a kid do that to an adult?

00:37:57.817 --> 00:37:59.026
That's why

00:38:00.444 --> 00:38:04.740
you should never dream
of sending me to an orphanage.

00:38:07.535 --> 00:38:08.536
By the way.

00:38:09.453 --> 00:38:10.830
I need some clothes.

00:38:11.414 --> 00:38:14.709
This is all I brought
when I moved in.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.044
Thanks in advance.

00:38:24.802 --> 00:38:26.012
How does this look?

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.682
- Do I look nice?
- Yeah.

00:38:30.308 --> 00:38:31.309
It's pretty.

00:38:35.354 --> 00:38:36.355
What about this?

00:38:37.773 --> 00:38:38.774
It's pretty.

00:38:41.944 --> 00:38:42.987
What's wrong?

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:44.071
Are you sulking?

00:38:45.239 --> 00:38:47.950
I want to go outside, too.

00:38:49.368 --> 00:38:51.829
Mom won't let me leave home.

00:38:52.705 --> 00:38:53.706
Jun Seo.

00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:59.003
Do you think your mom loves you?

00:39:00.129 --> 00:39:01.964
She doesn't let you go outside

00:39:03.424 --> 00:39:06.802
and she won't even let you
say hi to the neighbors.

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:09.472
Why do you think that is?

00:39:11.682 --> 00:39:12.892
Your mom.

00:39:14.769 --> 00:39:16.354
She's ashamed of you.

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:19.940
Because she doesn't love you.

00:39:20.399 --> 00:39:23.694
Her one and only son told her
he didn't feel well

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:26.489
but she didn't care at all.

00:39:27.323 --> 00:39:29.617
I'm the one who looks after you.

00:39:32.161 --> 00:39:33.329
Ah Jin.

00:39:34.372 --> 00:39:35.873
Does my mom

00:39:37.291 --> 00:39:38.834
not love me?

00:39:39.835 --> 00:39:40.836
No.

00:39:42.296 --> 00:39:44.507
She doesn't love you.

00:39:45.299 --> 00:39:47.218
So, she doesn't even get angry.

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:51.680
Your mom isn't on your side.

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:56.018
I bet she's thinking of ways
to get rid of us.

00:40:01.649 --> 00:40:04.068
Baek Ah Jin, your daughter,
is absolutely psycho.

00:40:04.735 --> 00:40:06.737
The kid manipulates me to no end.

00:40:07.363 --> 00:40:10.449
Why cause trouble by aggravating her?

00:40:10.533 --> 00:40:12.368
I told you to bear with it.

00:40:13.244 --> 00:40:14.245
Forget it.

00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:17.706
I can't live with her anymore.

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:19.917
Take her with you
or leave her at an orphanage.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.628
We'll never be legally married
until then.

00:40:22.711 --> 00:40:24.505
I'm on my way right now.

00:40:24.588 --> 00:40:27.133
I'll text you
to bring the kid outside.

00:40:27.216 --> 00:40:28.509
Make sure she doesn't notice.

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:45.151
What now?

00:40:45.651 --> 00:40:46.819
Are you spying on me again?

00:40:47.319 --> 00:40:48.946
I told you last time

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:52.658
that I'd tell Jun Seo everything
if you split us up.

00:40:54.243 --> 00:40:55.744
You're blackmailing me again.

00:40:55.828 --> 00:40:58.122
This is the last day
I put up with this.

00:40:58.205 --> 00:41:02.585
He doesn't know how things are
because you keep him indoors

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:06.255
but I bet he has a gut feeling.

00:41:06.338 --> 00:41:08.716
That his mom is a piece of trash.

00:41:12.011 --> 00:41:14.013
- Stay still!
- Jun Seo!

00:41:14.096 --> 00:41:15.306
Jun Seo!

00:42:07.358 --> 00:42:08.400
Die.

00:42:09.568 --> 00:42:10.778
Die.

00:42:11.695 --> 00:42:12.821
Die.

00:42:13.113 --> 00:42:14.156
Just die!

00:42:16.242 --> 00:42:17.826
Die already.

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:19.328
Die!

00:42:34.176 --> 00:42:35.177
Jun Seo...

00:42:37.054 --> 00:42:38.055
Jun Seo.

00:42:38.847 --> 00:42:40.558
Do you like your mom?

00:42:41.183 --> 00:42:44.311
Do you think your mom loves you?

00:43:02.621 --> 00:43:05.082
Call 911 and say
a kid fell from the second floor.

00:43:05.708 --> 00:43:06.875
Do it right now!

00:43:38.824 --> 00:43:39.992
What are you doing?

00:43:40.743 --> 00:43:41.744
Ms. Hwang.

00:43:42.369 --> 00:43:43.370
Guess what?

00:43:44.413 --> 00:43:47.458
People don't always die
from falling from high places.

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:49.918
My mom didn't.

00:43:51.629 --> 00:43:53.631
I went to check if she was dead.

00:43:54.214 --> 00:43:57.051
But she begged me to help her
as she lay on the ground.

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:00.471
No.

00:44:01.555 --> 00:44:02.556
You'll die.

00:44:05.059 --> 00:44:06.852
- Get down from there.
- No.

00:44:09.396 --> 00:44:11.315
I won't die easily, either.

00:44:12.941 --> 00:44:15.944
I'm pretty lucky

00:44:17.237 --> 00:44:19.156
and I'm a lot like my mom.

00:44:42.888 --> 00:44:45.474
I told you she shouldn't have a scar.

00:44:45.557 --> 00:44:47.643
How was I to know she'd jump?

00:44:47.726 --> 00:44:49.395
I told you so many times.

00:44:49.478 --> 00:44:52.523
She's no ordinary witch.
You can't upset her.

00:44:52.898 --> 00:44:55.401
We can't film a girl
with a bust-up head and broken leg.

00:44:56.068 --> 00:44:57.945
How are we to wait until she heals?

00:44:58.028 --> 00:45:00.239
Forget the money.
Send her away already!

00:45:00.322 --> 00:45:02.199
No way! She's worth a fortune.

00:45:03.742 --> 00:45:07.496
You don't have to listen
to the bad things grown-ups say.

00:45:10.165 --> 00:45:11.583
Why are you crying?

00:45:13.127 --> 00:45:15.754
I read your diary.

00:45:17.214 --> 00:45:18.215
DIARY
BAEK AH JIN

00:45:18.298 --> 00:45:20.092
I also know what X means.

00:45:22.678 --> 00:45:25.139
X gets angry
only when Jun Seo isn't around.

00:45:25.222 --> 00:45:27.224
I'm so sad when Jun Seo isn't around.

00:45:27.307 --> 00:45:28.767
X is such a bad grown-up.

00:45:28.851 --> 00:45:30.811
I hope Jun Seo takes my side.

00:45:30.894 --> 00:45:32.604
I don't want to go to an orphanage.

00:45:32.688 --> 00:45:34.565
I can't make X angry.

00:45:37.401 --> 00:45:40.863
Then you must know
X is a bad grown-up.

00:45:42.531 --> 00:45:43.532
I know.

00:45:44.032 --> 00:45:45.033
I'm sorry.

00:45:45.743 --> 00:45:48.245
You looked after me all night.

00:45:48.954 --> 00:45:50.497
Yet I didn't know about it.

00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:52.708
Do you still like X?

00:45:52.791 --> 00:45:55.294
No, I don't like her.

00:45:57.129 --> 00:45:58.505
I only like you, Ah Jin.

00:45:59.089 --> 00:46:01.508
You're the only nice person at home.

00:46:05.554 --> 00:46:06.555
"Home"?

00:46:07.639 --> 00:46:10.058
I might not be able to go back there.

00:46:11.226 --> 00:46:13.687
I might get kicked out.

00:46:14.229 --> 00:46:15.230
Says who?

00:46:15.939 --> 00:46:17.357
You won't get kicked out.

00:46:18.734 --> 00:46:21.320
I'll protect you so she can't do

00:46:22.446 --> 00:46:23.697
anything bad to you.

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:26.033
Does that mean

00:46:26.366 --> 00:46:28.243
you'll always be on my side?

00:46:28.535 --> 00:46:31.163
Yes, I'm always on your side.

00:46:32.164 --> 00:46:35.292
So, Ah Jin,
don't ever let go of my hand.

00:46:36.043 --> 00:46:37.044
Okay?

00:46:59.107 --> 00:47:01.360
Ah Jin, are you all right?

00:47:01.985 --> 00:47:03.111
You're awake.

00:47:03.612 --> 00:47:04.613
Do you recognize me?

00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:07.407
How can't I

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:10.285
when you're holding my hand so tight?

00:47:15.916 --> 00:47:17.918
Don't look at me like that.

00:47:18.001 --> 00:47:19.837
I'm not dead, am I?

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.339
You were unconscious
for three days straight.

00:47:23.674 --> 00:47:24.675
What?

00:47:32.182 --> 00:47:33.267
What's the date today?

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:39.982
The enrollment deadline
was two days ago.

00:47:42.192 --> 00:47:46.113
You didn't enroll in time,
so your admission was canceled.

00:47:46.196 --> 00:47:48.323
We texted you many times already.

00:47:49.867 --> 00:47:53.120
We already accepted
a student on the waiting list

00:47:53.203 --> 00:47:55.205
so I'm sorry about your situation.

00:47:55.289 --> 00:47:57.040
But there's nothing
we can do to help--

00:48:07.217 --> 00:48:10.429
Ah Jin, we graduate tomorrow.
Will you be at the ceremony?

00:48:11.471 --> 00:48:13.682
Yes, of course.

00:48:41.668 --> 00:48:42.669
Thank you.

00:49:09.112 --> 00:49:11.865
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR GRADUATION

00:49:16.203 --> 00:49:18.372
Ah Jin, why are you still here?

00:49:20.165 --> 00:49:21.458
Are you all right?

00:49:21.541 --> 00:49:23.293
I was worried when I heard
you were hospitalized.

00:49:23.669 --> 00:49:24.670
What happened to your face?

00:49:25.545 --> 00:49:27.339
I'm fine. I just fell.

00:49:27.756 --> 00:49:29.466
You should've been more careful.

00:49:29.549 --> 00:49:31.385
Congratulations on graduating.

00:49:31.468 --> 00:49:32.469
I'll take a photo for you.

00:49:35.389 --> 00:49:36.682
Are you ready?

00:49:36.765 --> 00:49:38.308
One, two, three.

00:49:40.268 --> 00:49:41.269
Smile a bit, will you?

00:49:41.812 --> 00:49:43.480
One, two...

00:49:52.489 --> 00:49:53.532
Jun Seo.

00:49:54.616 --> 00:49:55.951
I'm sorry I got here so late.

00:49:57.202 --> 00:49:59.121
Congratulations on graduating.

00:49:59.413 --> 00:50:00.706
Let's take some photos. Let's go.

00:50:04.668 --> 00:50:07.838
Did you hear from your grandpa?

00:50:07.921 --> 00:50:09.506
Does he know you're graduating?

00:50:09.881 --> 00:50:10.882
Yes.

00:50:10.966 --> 00:50:13.135
How? Did you tell him?

00:50:14.219 --> 00:50:15.303
Yes.

00:50:15.679 --> 00:50:17.264
Did he say anything?

00:50:18.181 --> 00:50:21.351
About a graduation present
or something.

00:50:21.935 --> 00:50:22.936
Like what?

00:50:23.395 --> 00:50:26.815
I mean you're an adult now

00:50:26.898 --> 00:50:29.526
so he might have prepared
something special--

00:50:29.609 --> 00:50:31.153
Take this, Mom.

00:50:31.236 --> 00:50:33.113
I'll eat with my friends.

00:50:33.196 --> 00:50:34.740
Wait, Jun Seo. My gosh.

00:50:43.123 --> 00:50:44.875
- Get in here.
- One, two, three.

00:50:45.333 --> 00:50:46.334
Look here, Mom.

00:51:25.874 --> 00:51:28.293
Thief! Catch that thief!

00:51:29.294 --> 00:51:30.587
Oh, no!

00:51:34.091 --> 00:51:35.801
He's a pickpocket!

00:51:44.768 --> 00:51:45.769
You asshole!

00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:19.845
If I hadn't cross paths
with that man then

00:52:21.346 --> 00:52:24.057
his life would've been
completely different.

00:52:26.685 --> 00:52:27.727
It's such a shame.

00:52:33.024 --> 00:52:35.610
The newbie's just 20 years old?

00:52:35.694 --> 00:52:37.737
He was sent here
from a youth detention center.

00:52:37.821 --> 00:52:40.532
His skin is so smooth and firm.

00:52:40.949 --> 00:52:42.033
I did, too, once.

00:52:43.034 --> 00:52:44.035
Jeez.

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:46.121
What's he in for?

00:52:47.205 --> 00:52:48.999
Murder, but not just any kind.

00:52:49.708 --> 00:52:51.293
Patricide. My gosh.

00:52:51.751 --> 00:52:54.629
That young guy killed his dad?

00:52:54.713 --> 00:52:56.548
Kids these days are fearless.

00:52:56.631 --> 00:52:59.176
I talked to him a bit,
and he's pretty docile.

00:52:59.634 --> 00:53:03.346
He got bullied so much
at the youth detention center.

00:53:03.889 --> 00:53:05.182
He could've stayed there

00:53:05.599 --> 00:53:07.267
but he chose to be transferred here.

00:53:14.482 --> 00:53:19.070
DEAR X

00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:41.171
