[Blood River]

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.980
[Based on the novel of the same name from Zhou Munan's Youth in Jianghu series]

[Available on fanqienovel.com & bkneng.com]

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.020
[Episode 37]

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:14.500
Move.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.980
Dear.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.130
Are you sure about this?

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.450
He might be back soon.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.890
I...

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.260
I feel uneasy.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.410
All right.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.290
Then,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.060
I will clear the way for you.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.730
Father,

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.220
but your health...

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.010
So be it.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.610
If I throw caution to the wind,

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.380
then so will you.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.610
Let's go.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.220
Stop.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.410
Come in and talk.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.980
Why did your frost poison

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.690
flare this bad all of a sudden?

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.170
In there,

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.610
did you eat something you shouldn't?

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.570
Skywater Cold Tea

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.700
and Ice-Month Trio...

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:18.730
They're all

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.700
everyday things.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.170
They're common to others,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.930
not to you.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.490
Why insist on having them?

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.660
[Thirty years ago]

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.050
Ruofeng, how are you?

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.930
Brother,

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.460
I'm feeling so cold.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.900
Am I dying?

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.490
If I die,

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.370
I'll see Mother.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.370
Stop the nonsense.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.120
Your hands are like ice.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.220
Tuck them under the quilt.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.410
This quilt is so thin.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.340
Why burn so little charcoal?

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.540
If Ruofeng catches cold,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.930
you'll answer for it!

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.660
It's this maid's incompetence.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.990
I bribed him with the earrings Her Highness left behind,

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.020
so the Household Bureau's junior steward relented.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.050
He said the Noble Consort comes first,

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.360
but in three days,

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.810
they'll send charcoal to us.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.020
All snobs serving the favored and slight the rest.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:30.700
Three days won't do.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.330
Ruofeng is young and frail.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.780
He can't wait that long!

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.290
Your Highness!

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.490
It's freezing outside.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.660
You'll get sick without your cloak.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:41.460
Your Highness!

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.810
This is exactly

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.170
what I want!

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.610
My brother and I may be out of favor,

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:52.900
but we're still princes!

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.290
I want everyone to see

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.220
how the Household Bureau

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.660
mistreats us!

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.100
Let's see

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.900
how they answer to my father!

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.810
Tomorrow is the Imperial Assembly.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.100
You think those pastries

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.460
were specially prepared

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.250
by your brother?

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.540
Does the answer

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:14.700
matter?

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:16.900
I think

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.850
Xiao Yong sent them.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:23.900
But your brother

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.460
surely knew.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.780
He just pretended

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:28.810
not to see.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.290
Jin Xuan.

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.810
Your Majesty, your orders?

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.170
I've never liked these pastries.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.900
Remove them all.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.660
Also,

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.700
tell Yong

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.170
not to send them again.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.780
Understood.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.900
I was wondering who it was,

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.370
turns out to be the former great eunuchs,

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.730
Sir Zhuo Qing's juniors.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.460
Sirs,

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.810
since you've entered the imperial tomb,

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.860
why return to meddle

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.150
in Tianqi City's strife?

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.900
Even with your faces veiled,

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.540
even if we've never met,

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.890
I can still tell by your technique

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.850
who you are.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:22.980
You really think

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.700
your deeds can fool the whole world?

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.460
And if we can't, so what?

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.340
History is written by the winners.

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:34.660
Even if you're the Xueyue Sword Deity,

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.810
you're still too young.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.050
With your skill,

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.610
can you beat the three of us?

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.220
When I draw my sword,

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.850
I never weigh the odds!

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:01.810
Su Muyu.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:03.850
Mu Fusheng.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.730
Su Ziyan.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.540
Xie Piyou.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.610
We meet again.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:12.900
Master Su,

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.810
since we parted at Wanjuan Tower,

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.020
you slipped into the jianghu

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.490
and found your way.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.700
But staying in Tianqi,

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.340
we need to seek a new patron.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:29.930
In the end,

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.130
we chose the First Prince, Xiao Yong.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.010
Never thought

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:36.850
we'd end up

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.180
on your opposite side.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.610
Perhaps, Master Su,

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.220
you could rechoose your side.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:45.770
Yes.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.220
Maybe after tonight,

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.820
Beili's brightest star, the Prince of Langya,

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.180
will fall.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.980
Choose a worthy lord now

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.130
so Blood River's men

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:02.300
won't die with you.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:03.460
A "worthy lord"?

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.770
So your "choice"

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.370
is to be a servant.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:12.580
What say you, Master Su?

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.650
Blood River belongs to itself.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.820
And I'm not here

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:19.650
for you anyway.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.250
But your lives

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.130
end here tonight.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:25.420
For that choice,

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.770
you'll pay the price.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.250
You...

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:41.890
Sir.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:45.980
Sir Zhuo Qing.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.940
You don't look surprised.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.850
So you came for me.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:55.370
Master Su,

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.250
what do you want?

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.490
The Prince of Langya thinks

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.530
you left the imperial tomb

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.250
with the Dragonseal Scroll.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:08.890
I'm here tonight

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.530
to make sure it stays.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.300
So,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.010
this is your deal with the Prince of Langya?

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:20.940
An assassin of Blood River

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.890
helps a great hero

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.300
seize a last-dynasty edict of succession.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.770
How ironic.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.170
It does sound

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.060
rather ridiculous.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:37.610
As if...

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:41.130
only those

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:42.980
who stand in the light

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.300
would ever do such things.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.530
I do this today

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.720
so that it won't look ridiculous

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.460
when Blood River does the same

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.250
in future!

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.850
Master Su,

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:03.980
if I don't

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.940
have the scroll?

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.340
That doesn't matter.

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.250
Tonight, besides the scroll,

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.980
you have something else

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.650
that must be taken here!

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.770
What?

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:21.300
Your life.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.300
You're opening

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.100
with the Eighteen-Sword Array!

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:06.340
You guys...

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.130
Sir!

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.890
It was supposed to be just the two of us,

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.100
but they heard the news

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:10.830
and slipped out too.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:12.030
Not too early, not too late,

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:12.580
just in time!

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.010
We broke orders coming here.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.420
Don't blame us, Sir!

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:16.420
Sir!

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.940
Fight with no worries!

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.300
We've got your back!

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.090
Yes!

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:20.980
We've got your back!

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:24.530
What can you possibly do?

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.680
The night bell's tolling.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:46.980
Curfew's on.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.130
Tonight,

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.890
no one will disturb this fight.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.180
Vermilion Bird Avenue in Tianqi

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:54.940
shines the brightest.

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:56.530
It's a fitting place

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:58.530
for you to meet your end.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:12:59.940
Enough talk!

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.730
What a beautiful strike!

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.840
I heard

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.220
you were once a step

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.010
from the Spirit-Roam level.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:55.180
Yes.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.080
But Mr. Li

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.700
smacked my crown,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.100
and I fell into the Grand-Free level.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.010
Even so,

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.770
I'm still first in Tianqi.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.300
Only Chancellor Qi Tianchen

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.060
is fit to face me.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.850
But for tomorrow's Imperial Assembly,

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:17.890
he's gone to Yuege Terrace outside the city.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.890
My father once told me something.

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.700
If it's from the Lord of No-Sword City,

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:27.650
I'll hear it before you die.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.530
Only by beating

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.180
someone stronger,

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:33.530
does a fight

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.010
mean anything.

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:38.770
Even if it costs you your life,

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.180
it still has meaning?

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.300
It does.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.370
Who dares touch my daughter!

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:04.940
Dear,

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:07.740
go find the one you love.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.890
These spooks and fiends

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:12.060
won't last a breath

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:13.220
before me!

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:16.220
Father...

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.580
There's fight left in this old body yet.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:23.700
Dear,

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.130
I swear

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.340
I won't die.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:27.420
Go on, don't worry.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.250
It's a promise.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:31.530
It's a promise.

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:37.730
Dear, go now!

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.580
So this is

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:15.820
the "meaning" you spoke of?

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:19.100
Yes.

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:21.250
You're way out

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.010
of your league.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.370
To kill me,

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.420
you're not strong enough.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.300
Humble Heart Technique...

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:54.300
Good.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:57.060
Su Muyu,

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:59.610
you're good.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.610
Your sword energy is even better.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.220
You want to drain my sword energy

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.620
to break through again.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.250
Smart,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.010
Master Su.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.380
If we weren't enemies now,

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:18.050
perhaps

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.620
I'd call you a friend.

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:23.770
You and I

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:27.090
will never be friends.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.860
An assassin living in the dark

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:36.940
can still keep your pride?

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:38.940
We dwell in darkness,

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:41.530
but our hearts face the light.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.140
You stand in the light,

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.380
yet sink

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:49.330
into your own shadow.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.940
That's just

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:00.220
your wishful thinking.

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:02.180
Your Patriarch

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.530
has already cast you aside.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:06.830
Right now,

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.090
he's outside the palace,

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:12.380
moving to cut off the Prince of Langya.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.380
Great Eunuch Zhuo Qing,

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.380
do you believe

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:20.660
there's such a thing

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.180
as absolute trust?

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:25.900
Between me and Changhe...

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.050
Between me and Muyu,

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:29.460
it's absolute trust!

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.090
Su Changhe...

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.180
It's me,

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.220
Blood River's Patriarch,

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:51.810
the Undertaker

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:53.570
to bury you.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:57.380
So that was your aim.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:59.620
Su Changhe,

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:02.090
you hid it this long

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.940
just to land that palm on me?

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.940
Yes.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.940
You're the top fighter

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:10.700
in Tianqi,

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:12.330
once just a step away

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.180
from the Spirit-Roam level

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.730
above the Sword Deities.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.570
If we don't wound you somehow,

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:19.810
how will we ever stand a chance?

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.380
How did you pass

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.250
the truth-testing snake's trial?

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.730
What I told you that day

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:27.570
wasn't a lie.

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:30.090
Muyu and I chose differently.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:32.140
He'd ally with the Prince of Langya

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:33.700
to lead Blood River into the light.

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.700
As for me,

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.330
from the first time I met you,

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:38.570
I had a new idea.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.460
If I'm right,

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:42.050
your Humble Heart Technique,

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.570
Ye Dingzhi's Void-Thought Art,

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.290
and Blood River's Hell Palm

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.810
come from the same manual.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:49.980
Our inner force

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:51.530
can interlink.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.010
So,

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.530
if I can draw out

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:55.700
your Humble Heart power,

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.490
I'll become...

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.250
invincible.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.250
Arrogant.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:07.490
Arrogant?

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:10.170
I could feel

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:11.380
that palm I struck

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.190
already worked.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.620
That is the ninth level

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:40.620
of the Hell Palm?

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:41.940
My apologies.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:44.250
Only the ninth.

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.700
Today,

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.000
I'll feed my palm

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.050
with your power.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.090
I'll step to the tenth!

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:54.810
You'd use my strength

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:57.050
to reach the Spirit-Roam level?

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.490
Too bad.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.700
Your ninth-level Hell Palm

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.250
is a false state.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:05.660
Yes,

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:07.290
a false state.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:08.940
So what?

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:10.770
I, Su Changhe,

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.090
am hypocritical,

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.620
greedy, and cruel.

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:15.290
If it lets me win,

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:16.860
no price is too high.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:19.700
My Six-Form Hell Palm

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:22.900
will send you into the wheel of rebirth!

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.980
That palm

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:12.810
is poisoned?

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.410
The venom comes

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:15.620
from the Slumbering Serpent King

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:19.420
of the Yellow Springs Pawnshop.

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:21.730
Zhuo Qing,

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.620
from the day I first met you,

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:28.180
I began planning this moment.

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:30.290
I've held back this long,

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.220
played along with you all this time,

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.180
all just to kill you

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.770
here and now.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:41.810
To kill me?

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:43.140
Of course.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.620
It's been over twenty years

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.620
since our first meeting!

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:22.140
When did we meet?

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:23.550
Back in the Miao Territory!

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.220
You're...

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:29.730
I was born in Sacred Fire Village.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.770
You were sent there

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.490
to seize

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:36.140
our sacred Fire-Dragon Lingzhi.

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:37.810
We refused,

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:40.250
so you slaughtered our entire village.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.420
That day at Wanjuan Tower,

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:46.810
I refused to read the records about me.

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:49.250
Because I had always known

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:50.530
who my enemy was!

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:51.900
Die!

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:21.330
Sir!

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.130
Sir!

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:26.180
Sir!

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.570
Kill them.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.140
Understood.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:31.330
You may head back to the Clinic.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.420
Changhe and I will handle this.

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.570
Understood!

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:40.730
It's over,

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:42.490
Su Muyu.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.380
Sir...

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:50.570
what are you doing?

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.860
Your skills may be weak,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.530
but each of you

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:13.140
still carries decades of inner force.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.860
Since you're doomed to die anyway,

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.140
just give me

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:19.530
all your inner force.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.980
Let me touch

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:25.220
the Spirit-Roam level again!

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.810
Draining inner force, huh? I can too.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.460
Die!

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:02.010
I've practiced Humble Heart

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:03.380
for years.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.770
I've drained more people

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.220
than I can count.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.730
Now you dare try

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:11.810
to drain mine?

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.180
Aren't you afraid you'll burst?

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:17.090
Blood River's Undertaker

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.810
is famous indeed.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.050
Today,

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.490
I'll bury you first...

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:28.980
then kill that Umbrella Ghost!

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:39.770
Su Muyu,

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:40.730
go now.

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:41.980
I'll hold him back!

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.570
It's no use.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.380
Humble Heart and Hell Palm

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:02.660
share one source.

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:04.730
Once you start draining,

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.900
you can't stop.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:15.860
Su Muyu!

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:18.730
Don't be reckless.

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:20.220
Go now!

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:19.660
Su Muyu!

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.570
Demon Sword...

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:37.410
Why can't the light of this world

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:39.590
make room for Blood River?

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.350
No one is born a killer.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.130
We deserve

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:46.050
another chance to choose.

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:51.180
Why do you

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.980
block us again and again?

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:04.290
Su Muyu!

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.290
That sword art

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:07.940
will cost your life!

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.140
Changhe,

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:11.530
if my bloodshed today

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:13.050
can make Blood River run clear

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:14.180
and no longer dim,

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:16.700
then I'll die for it.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.810
At Beili's founding,

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.690
Marquis Fengyue

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:25.330
opposed Emperor Tianwu.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:26.710
The Sword Demon under him

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:28.370
created a sword technique

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.900
called the Seven-Slaughter Six-Annihilation Sword!

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:32.090
So be it.

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:35.010
Slay the foe,

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:36.330
slay a friend,

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.010
slay immortals,

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:38.940
slay ghosts,

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.050
slay the self,

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:41.940
slay all that exists,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.140
slay with no escape,

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:44.810
these are the Seven Slaughters.

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:46.330
Extinguish the Heavenly Way,

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:47.290
the Demonic Way,

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.810
the Human Way,

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:49.490
the Ghost Way,

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.240
the Asura Way,

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:51.980
the Hell Way,

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:53.460
these are the Six Annihilations.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.660
Zhuo Qing,

00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.940
choose

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.460
your road home!

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.250
Your strongest strike

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:11.290
bears your name, Muyu.

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:13.700
Let me see

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:15.010
what your blood rain looks like

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.810
once you go demonic.

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:29.250
Fall!

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:04.420
I stopped

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.900
that move of yours.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:07.980
How is this old eunuch

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:10.050
so strong?

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.770
Die!

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:56.570
Su Muyu!

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.330
I brought your sword.

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:02.010
Crane Feather Sword!

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.700
I was born in No-Sword City,

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.940
raised with the blade.

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:26.700
I've seen the mightiest strike on earth.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.530
It once avenged

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:30.330
my lost family.

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:34.140
Today, as long as my sword is in hand,

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:36.570
I can carve a future

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.980
for my folks,

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:41.180

I was wrong.

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:11.080
Just like me,

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.010
you're one of the finest men!

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:23.860
Miss Bai,

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:25.570
what's wrong?

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:38.490
I...

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.780
I fell for my martial niece's trap.

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.300
What exactly happened?

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.050
I was still not fully healed,

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.170
then burned my essence blood

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.610
to refine the antidote.

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:54.900
So,

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:57.090
the puppet poison in me

00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:58.300
that Baicao should've purged

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.490
has now flared up again.

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:02.460
It must have been a trap

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.010
set by Night Crow.

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:18.050
Dear,

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.460
isn't there a cure for puppet poison?

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:23.530
It's brewed...

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:25.650
with my blood...

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:27.860
How would it cure my own toxin?

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.090
Su Muyu...

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.610
I'm here.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.210
Kill me.

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:41.010
Su Muyu,

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:42.260
kill me!

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:50.460
I don't want to be a puppet.

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:52.650
It'd look monstrous.

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:55.780
You won't die.

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:57.900
We'll find a way.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.170
there's no time.

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:01.460
This time,

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:03.170
no remedy will work.

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.980
Su Muyu,

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:07.010
it's really too late.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:09.980
I'm sorry.

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:12.650
I...

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:16.210

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.130
It's no use.

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:24.380
Inner force can't purge this toxin.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:25.740
Dear,

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:26.900

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:27.690

He cost me my bodyguard puppet
