You were a good archer.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.980
Instead of training on

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.100
the battlefield

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.290
and developing your abilities,

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.780
you just had to go for a despicable job like being an assassin.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.060
You brought this upon yourself.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.220

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.140
my life and death have nothing to do with you?

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.930
Didn't you say

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.410
that you weren't willing to get involved with Tianqi City?

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:29.610
Back then,

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.540

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.540
Tai'an Palace,

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.700
it was much more perilous than today.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.170
Even so,

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.370
you didn't come to Tianqi.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.370
That night,

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.900
I was already in Tianqi City.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.660
I planted some spies within your ranks.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.490
Whenever you were in danger,

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.780
he would fire a signal arrow.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.520
And then, I'd take my sword

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.540
and storm the palace.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.020
I don't care if it's King Qing,

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.020
King Jingyu,

or even Emperor Tai'an.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.340
If I take my sword with me,

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.730
you have to come with me by hook or by crook.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.250
Let's cut our conversation short.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.020
As night slowly rises,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.100
the wind drifts away in parting.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.980

Xuanwu Guardian, you may come in.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.460
The last time

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.370
I sustained such a serious injury,

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.850
it was because of you.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.810
Back then,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.340
you weren't this anxious.

Sit down and speak.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.700
You're still as tight-lipped as ever.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.370
In the past, I used to hate you

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.540
for being a silent gourd.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.170
But now, I realized something.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.250
When you fancy a person,

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.540
even when you don't speak,

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.220
you can express your feelings through your actions

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.540

your feelings for me.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:10.700
Now that I think about it,

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.660
I actually won the heart of the mighty Xuanwu Guardian.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.700
I can die without regrets now.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.410

his body was already missing.

that Jin Xuan, his disciple, has taken his body with him.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:37.820
Is...

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.060
Is that all?

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:43.980
What about Prince of Langya?

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.420
Is he satisfied with this ending?

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.610
His Highness wasn't satisfied at all.

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:50.180
He submitted a memorial impeaching First Prince.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.100
And, he submitted evidence of

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.490
First Prince's participation in the rebellion.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.220
But on the second day,

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.820
His Majesty has already permitted Xiao Yong's request.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:14:59.530
His Highness wanted to seek an audience with His Majesty,

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.940
but His Majesty refused it.

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:03.420
Is the Dragonseal Scroll still nowhere to be found?

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:04.580
That's right.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:07.420
It seems as if someone has retrieved it before us.

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:08.890
The Inner Security Division will continue

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:10.300
to investigate the case.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:16.490
Head back now.

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.530
None of your answers was satisfying.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.060
Patriarch, what do you plan to do next?

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.180
Me?

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:26.850
We'll talk about it after Su Muyu regains consciousness.

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:28.900
I'll heed his will once he wakes up.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.950
After all, he was the one who decided to come to Tianqi.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.700
If he doesn't regain consciousness,

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.220
I'll unsheathe my sword and hunt them down.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.010
Xiao Yong will die.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.820
Prince of Langya

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:42.850
will die as well.

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:46.580
Go now.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.130
Was I too harsh

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.820
to your lover just now?

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.490
You were gentler

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:17.820
compared to your usual attitude.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:19.740
You went through

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:21.250
a life-or-death situation with your beloved.

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:23.820
Why does it feel like you're unhappy about it?

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:26.850
Look at the current situation.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:29.470
How can I be happy about it?

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:34.610
Yumo,

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.420
right now,

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:38.530
you're the only dependable member of the Mu family.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:40.100
I understand.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.060
From now on,

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.220
I'm the head of Mu family.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.940
I'll set aside

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:50.250
my feelings and relationships.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:52.340
Will you be able to achieve that?

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.850
Don't worry.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:56.650
And,

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.890
since he has already given me his promise,

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.370
there's no need for me to be impatient.

00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:04.980
Go now.

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:10.090
You're finally awake.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:12.570
She...

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:19.660
White cranes fly south,

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.860
gazing across the Huai River.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:34.730
Miss Bai didn't suffer

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:36.770
during her last moments.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.570
Using my Inch Sword,

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.730
Uncle Zhe, he...

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:47.620
You know this too.

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:49.980
Uncle Zhe always does a clean job.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:52.980
It already ended

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.080
before Miss Bai felt anything.

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:55.530
Uncle Zhe said

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:57.900
that since you were unconscious,

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:00.660
he had no choice

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:03.330
but to do it on your behalf.

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:11.330
They waited a few days for you,

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.420
but you didn't regain consciousness.

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:17.010
Therefore, Uncle Zhe will escort her body

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.900
back to Medicine King Valley first.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.090
From now on, each Qingming,

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.860
on the day of remembrance,

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.330
they'll prepare a pot of wine for you

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:27.220
in Medicine King Valley.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.050
They'll wait for you.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:07.250
Where's Night Crow?

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.900
According to Yumo,

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.620
she should've been reduced to ashes

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.380
by Phoenix Descent.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.660
What about Xiao Yong?

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:20.860
He confessed to his crimes.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.050
However, his father

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:24.900
managed to keep him alive.

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.900
He would only be imprisoned at the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:30.770
Prince of Langya asked us about the decision we would make.

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:33.460
I said I would heed your will

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:35.220
after you regain consciousness.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:54.530
Your Highness.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:20:59.900
Has Su Muyu

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.330
regain consciousness?

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:04.010
Not yet.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:05.940
I only met Su Changhe.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.290
What did the Patriarch of Blood River

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:17.940
say?

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:20.700
According to him,

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:22.660
if Su Muyu regains consciousness,

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:24.770
he will heed his will.

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:27.620
If he doesn't regain consciousness,

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.330
he'll kill Xiao Yong.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:32.290
He'll kill you as well.

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.620
Perhaps

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.250
my life will end before he hunts me down.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.490
Who are you?

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:22.900
I came here to pay my final respects

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.860
to the person behind you.

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:27.050
Such audacity!

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:36.090
Am I audacious?

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.580
A good friend of mine

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:39.870
rescued your son.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.810
But the person behind you

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:43.730
took her life away.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.220
Shouldn't I come here to pay my final respects?

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.490
So, it's you guys.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.420
But he has already confessed to his crime

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.530
and will be sent to the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:56.290
His Majesty has already issued an imperial decree.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.180
His life now rests

00:22:58.920 --> 00:22:59.980
in the hands of Heaven.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:02.090
I am

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:04.250
Heaven itself.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.530
Your Highness, are you planning to go into confinement?

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:18.660
Master Su,

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.290
you guys have already won.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.090
Prince of Langya and his men

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.620
would surely keep his promise to you.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.420
They'll allow Blood River

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:29.770
to walk in the sunlight.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:32.700
Why do you

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.980
have to do this?

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:36.620
So, a prince

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.050
can kill at will, huh?

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.900
Even if one has to accept punishment,

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:44.420
they can survive

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.810
as long as they give up on their title, huh?

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:51.900
I haven't stepped into the Imperial Astronomical Bureau yet.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:54.660
I'm still a prince.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.380
Do you know

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:59.000
what sort of crime it is

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.330
to kill a prince on the streets?

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:02.570
If you do so, Blood River

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.530
will never be able

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:07.220
to walk in the sunlight.

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:09.090
A shadow will always remain one.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.140
It'll disappear when it makes contact with sunlight.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:14.380
You guys will become

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:15.730
the most-wanted criminals of Beili.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.380
Each of your portraits

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.810
will be posted

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.980
at the most obvious spots of every city.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.530
When Qingyang and Xuewei died,

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.290
Yumo asked me a question.

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:32.570
Once,

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.580
the death of our companions

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:36.710
were nothing special

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:38.140
to us.

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:43.180
But now, everything has changed.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.660
How many people still have to die

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.570
in order for us to reach the Other Shore?

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.620
I have my own choice.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:58.730
That is to avenge Miss Bai,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:00.730
Qingyang,

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.900
Xuewei,

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.810
and every companion

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:06.290
who was manipulated by you all.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.860
There's a certain meaning

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:19.780
behind my choice.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:21.770
From now on,

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.460
the entire Tianqi City

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:25.570
will remember the name of Blood River.

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:29.570
No one can manipulate us

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:31.980
like pawns again.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.290
It's because they've already witnessed

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:38.180
the price they have to pay for doing so.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:15.810
Darn it!

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:54.660
What's the matter?

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.380
Did you feel his presence as well?

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.290
What are you looking at?

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:12.290
Nothing.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:28.860
Su Yunxiu,

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:30.490
how's my daughter doing?

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:31.860
She's fine.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.290
Don't worry.

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:35.250
Since I've stepped in,

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:36.900
I'll save her no matter what.

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.570
But,

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.290
there's one condition.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.380
What is it?

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:41.380
Tell me.

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:43.770
I have to take the miracle physician with me for the time being.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:45.980
But why?

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.010
I need to cultivate

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.050
a martial art after this.

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:52.420
I need another miracle physician to be on standby

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:53.220
next to me.

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:55.420
And, I don't want to be targeted by Su Muyu.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.980
It's very troublesome.

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:03.290
You know my personality too.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.900
If you dare to utter a single word to him,

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.380
Bai Hehuai

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:09.980
will never return to your side again.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:27.530
Say,

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.140
what will Su Muyu become in the future?

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.860
This is truly intriguing.

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:35.420
Right when

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:37.010
he's about to step into the light,

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.490
he's plunged into the dark abyss again.

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:52.380
We're going to leave Tianqi City soon.

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:54.770
We're here to bid you farewell, Prince of Langya.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:58.660
Perhaps you guys

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.050
shouldn't have killed Xiao Yong.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.810
There are many ways to resolve the situation.

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.380
But you guys just have to choose

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.530
the one that's unsalvageable.

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:11.980
Everyone says that I'm a lunatic.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.810
Actually,

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:16.420
my buddy is the same.

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.900
Your Highness,

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:23.020
perhaps Blood River's Other Shore isn't

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:23.980
what we expected it to be.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:25.980
What we wish to become

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.810
are people who can stand beneath the light,

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.460
not pawns meant for those fighting for power.

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:34.090
If Xiao Yong was sent to the Imperial Astronomical Bureau,

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:35.980
under the surveillance of

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:36.810
Qi Tianchen, the Chancellor,

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:38.980
it would be difficult for him to rise again.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.730
But now that Xiao Yong is dead,

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.570
that'll complicate

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:45.180
a lot of things.

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.010
Perhaps in the past,

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:49.940
Blood River stood in the shadows.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.700
Perhaps in the future,

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.330
Blood River still isn't able

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.700
to walk in the sunlight.

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:56.980
But at the very least, right now,

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.900
we carry with us a justice of our own.

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.090
And, within that justice,

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.460
Xiao Yong deserves to die.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.380
If anyone dares to use us

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.570
as pawns again,

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.530
don't blame us for rising up and taking control.

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:18.900
Changhe and I will return to Blood River.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.900
From now on, we'll tread on our own path.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:23.810
We'll reach the Other Shore eventually,

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.460
no matter how tough the journey will be.

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:32.220
All right.

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:36.570
If so, I hope that we won't be enemies

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.290
the next time we meet.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.220
But it's difficult for us

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.290
to become friends as well.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:55.490
Farewell.

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:19.810
Chancellor,

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.380
First Prince Xiao Yong

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:22.770
was assassinated on his way

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:24.180
to the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.380
Who did it?

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:30.090
I only saw one of them before.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:32.010
Back then, he was outside our bureau.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.770
But you drove him off with your talisman.

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:42.700
Perhaps

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.660
I was too narrow-minded back then.

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:49.460
The head of Su family

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.980
is worth an encounter.

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.530
What's the matter?

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:28.330
Will you regret it?

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:34.570
We put in so much effort for this.

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:36.700
But everything went back to square one

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.010
after you killed him.

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:46.530
Prince of Langya won't be able to help us out.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:48.900
He's going to die soon.

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.490
He wishes to pave a path

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.530
for those he cared for before his death.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.330
But the people he cared for,

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.140
the path they'll take

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.730
is vastly different from ours.

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:06.570
The turmoil of Tianqi City

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.530
is just beginning.

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:11.420
However,

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:14.010
