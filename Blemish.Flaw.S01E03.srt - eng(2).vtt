00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.640
Honey.

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:49.680
It was my fault yesterday.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.519
I've been under too much pressure.

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:54.239
And I can't control my temper.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.560
(Now brings you the update)

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.719
(of latest weather forecast.)

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.200
(From tonight to tomorrow,)

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.000
(overcast turning to cloudy.)

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.840
(East wind force...)

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:05.400
Still mad at me?

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.159
Honey.

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:09.479
Look at today's event

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.080
and my current position.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.439
Nothing to worry about.

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.400
I am the one

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:16.080
with the best potential.

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:17.159
Indeed.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.840
The company hasn't yet reached

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:20.159
full profitability.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.280
But all operations

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:22.360
are running well.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.680
The fund

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:24.919
is for art investments.

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:26.000
Honey.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.759
Don't you trust my aesthetics

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:28.840
and influence?

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.240
My parents understand nothing

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.560
but bank balances.

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:34.240
I need to reassure them.

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.960
How to reassure them?

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:43.000
Art investments

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.599
take time.

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.879
Don't rush.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.360
Once we get profit,

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:48.560
they'd stop worrying.

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:49.280
You should

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.159
at least let them get something.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.199
Listen.

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.039
Let them get a portion

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.479
to reassure my dad.

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:57.560
The doctor said

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.520
emotional state

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.280
greatly impacts his condition.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.400
A portion?

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:07.439
How much?

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.560
My dad invested about

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:12.120
25 million into the company.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.039
Give him back 10 million.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.960
That much?

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.840
That'd mean huge losses.

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:23.840
Then be it.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.680
It's all family money.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.360
How can you say that?

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:30.240
That's the money my dad

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.159
earned.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.960
I don't want them to worry.

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:34.319
Nothing to worry about.

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:34.879
I said...

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:35.560
Zeng Jie.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.439
When you needed funds,

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:38.800
all of us supported you.

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:40.240
Now I want to reassure

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.840
my parents

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:41.680
and get a portion

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:42.759
of their investment back.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.680
Just a portion,

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.719
not even half.

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:48.319
Can't you make it?

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.319
It's not like that.

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.919
But doing this

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:54.439
creates unnecessary losses.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.400
What's the point?

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:06.240
Slow down.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.319
Why drive so fast?

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:09.639
I accept losses.

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:10.680
It's our money,

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.520
anyway.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.399
Slow down, Bai Xiaoling!

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.800
Don't drive so fast.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.360
Fine, Bai Xiaoling.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.040
As you say.

00:04:29.079 --> 00:04:29.920
I'll arrange it soon.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.759
How soon?

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.160
It isn't a bank deposit.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.240
We can't get cash just

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.839
by a password.

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:41.000
It takes time.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.519
How long?

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:43.480
40 days.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.439
40 business days.

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:45.399
Okay.

00:04:58.208 --> 00:04:59.480
Bai Xiaoling, are you crazy?

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.279
I'm not.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.319
I'm perfectly calm

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:04.199
and sane.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.680
Pull over.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.439
I'll take a taxi.

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:14.720
40 business days, right?

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.439
Today is October 22.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.560
By the end

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:18.639
of the year, right?

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.319
Yes.

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:41.519
Off work?

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:43.040
Come to my office.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.160
It's so late now.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.319
Aren't you eating?

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:57.439
Take a seat.

00:05:57.519 --> 00:05:58.319
Take a seat, please.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.240
Xiaoling.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.879
I ordered some dishes today.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.160
Get to the point. I'll drink tea.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.240
Alright, here.

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:16.959
Here, have some tea.

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:18.800
I've learned some of

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.000
your company's finances.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.000
You own it,

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:22.560
but most assets

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:24.120
have been transferred

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.720
by various means.

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:27.560
Zhang Ye, I'm not

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.279
that clueless.

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:30.319
I came to hear

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:31.639
if you have any solutions.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.639
Right.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.800
Don't rush.

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:34.959
As a lawyer...

00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:36.879
if I needed a lawyer,
I'd have hired one.

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:37.920
Came to you

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:39.360
because we're old classmates.

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:40.680
I want your opinion.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:42.680
Here.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.879
Have a piece of fish.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.199
You don't like fish skin.

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:48.079
I'll remove it.

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:49.480
Xiaoling.

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:51.319
You couldn't find a suitable lawyer.

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:52.439
You came to me

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:54.120
because you trust me.

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:55.920
Yes.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.759
We were classmates,

00:06:59.199 --> 00:06:59.879
but if not for

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:01.279
your troubles,

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:02.160
would you even

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.040
remember me?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Back in school,

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.319
you were my goddess.

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:07.480
I was your backup.

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:08.920
I didn't deserve you.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:09.920
But these years,

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:11.160
I've been working hard.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.120
Got my master's, then PhD.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.639
Now,

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.560
I'm a partner of a law firm.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.199
Do you know

00:07:31.839 --> 00:07:32.839
when you got married,

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.319
how upset I was?

00:07:36.079 --> 00:07:37.439
I was upset because

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.560
I thought my progress

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.879
was too slow to catch up

00:07:40.959 --> 00:07:41.560
with you.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:42.920
But

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:44.720
you married a poor guy.

00:07:47.079 --> 00:07:47.800
When

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:48.959
you got married,

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:50.199
I texted you

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:51.439
asking you to do

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.839
a prenuptial agreement.

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:54.800
You didn't even reply.

00:07:58.199 --> 00:07:59.319
I'm sorry, Zhang Ye.

00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:00.959
But love

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.079
is unpredictable.

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:05.560
True.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.399
My marriage has issues,

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.240
but I don't regret

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.040
what I did.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.600
Because I did it myself.

00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:13.600
At that time,

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:15.120
I'd never anticipate today.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.319
Had I chosen

00:08:16.439 --> 00:08:17.560
someone else

00:08:17.959 --> 00:08:18.600
or even you,

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.800
maybe I would

00:08:21.399 --> 00:08:22.680
still end up here.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.000
Alright.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.720
If you divorce now,

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:33.679
you'll lose your assets.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.559
You have no evidence of your husband's

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.559
marital misconduct.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.159
Divorce abandoning my assets?

00:08:42.879 --> 00:08:43.840
It isn't legally

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.320
recognized in law.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.480
The law only stipulates
the right of compensation

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.240
for damages for the non-fault party.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.919
Article 46 of the Marriage Law.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.559
So you mean,

00:08:53.679 --> 00:08:54.840
if I divorce,

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.159
we must split assets equally,

00:08:57.159 --> 00:08:57.600
correct?

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:58.799
Yes.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.879
But your family is quite wealthy.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.440
You probably don't care about

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.360
that bit of community property.

00:09:05.559 --> 00:09:07.000
Right. My family is wealthy.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.840
But my dad fell ill two years ago.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.360
I don't know business,

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.559
nor am I interested.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.159
So I sold the factories

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.039
he owned.

00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:17.039
You invest all the money

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.840
into the company?

00:09:21.919 --> 00:09:23.960
Your husband never studied finance?

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.279
His methods are extremely professional.

00:09:27.799 --> 00:09:28.720
Xiaoling,

00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:30.720
I have to ask.

00:09:31.679 --> 00:09:33.159
Why are you getting divorced?

00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:36.639
Are you having an affair?

00:09:36.759 --> 00:09:37.519
No.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:38.960
Then he is?

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:40.879
Probably not.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.240
You fell out of love?

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.320
Get back to the point.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.039
Zhang Ye,

00:09:55.639 --> 00:09:57.720
aside from making me
lose half my assets,

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.440
what other suggestions?

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:05.919
Bigamy?

00:10:06.799 --> 00:10:07.600
Definitely not.

00:10:08.759 --> 00:10:09.639
Domestic violence?

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.080
Hard to get evidence.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.919
Doesn't seem possible.

00:10:14.639 --> 00:10:16.639
Abuse or abandonment of family members?

00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:17.879
Unlikely.

00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:21.240
A married person

00:10:21.399 --> 00:10:22.720
cohabiting with others.

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:27.360
Your husband went through such pains

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.919
to snatch your family's assets.

00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:31.200
It shows he's greedy.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.000
He's often out in public,

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.600
proving he's not low-key.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.519
A man chasing fame and fortune

00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:40.720
couldn't possibly resist women.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.120
So go find some evidence.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.960
Only by getting the evidence

00:10:46.559 --> 00:10:47.559
can you stand a chance.

00:10:47.799 --> 00:10:48.759
I mean a chance,

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.120
not a guarantee.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.360
Give me your phone.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.279
I can't help you

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.919
with evidence.

00:11:01.799 --> 00:11:02.840
But I know a lawyer

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.720
in this area.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.399
You can try consulting him.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.679
Other than this,

00:11:12.919 --> 00:11:14.240
I have no other choice?

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.480
To keep the money,

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.000
you'll lose dignity.

00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:34.799
Please give me a five-star rating!

00:11:35.616 --> 00:11:38.229
(Submit Five-Star Rating Anonymously)

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.519
(You've come this far.)

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:42.639
(An advice)

00:11:42.879 --> 00:11:44.200
(for you.)

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.360
(Stop agonizing.)

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:27.759
(Who is he?)

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.559
Professor Zeng.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:48.600
Hello.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.399
Who are you?

00:12:49.799 --> 00:12:50.240
A video

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.159
content creator,

00:12:51.799 --> 00:12:52.879
with a million followers.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:54.519
Good!

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:55.279
Account?

00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:56.600
The Logic Behind Art.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.840
That's an interesting name.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.799
What's your name?

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.440
Just call me Big Hui.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:06.879
Talk over there.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:11.799
Be careful.

00:13:14.639 --> 00:13:15.360
Record it alone?

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.159
(No sound or lighting.)

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.240
This one suffices.

00:13:19.639 --> 00:13:20.879
Video creators work this way.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:21.759
Rest assured.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.679
After editing the video,

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:24.879
we'll send it

00:13:24.919 --> 00:13:25.679
for your approval.

00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:31.759
This cup

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.320
is your work, right?

00:13:33.799 --> 00:13:34.480
A student's.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.679
I keep some

00:13:35.679 --> 00:13:36.679
presentable ones.

00:13:36.879 --> 00:13:38.360
Student works are this exquisite?

00:13:38.559 --> 00:13:39.519
Remarkable!

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.279
I heard this studio

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.919
was rebuilt after a fire.

00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:49.440
You came to interview me,

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.879
so I presume you've done some research.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.480
The studio fire

00:13:53.759 --> 00:13:54.519
and reconstruction

00:13:54.799 --> 00:13:55.919
made the news.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.399
Even TV reporters came.

00:13:57.408 --> 00:13:59.600
Art master who has gone
through a fire. I've seen it.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.919
So there's no need to ask me

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.360
about the fire.

00:14:02.879 --> 00:14:04.039
I've answered many times.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:05.960
We don't need

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:06.600
to waste time

00:14:06.639 --> 00:14:07.399
on this.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.639
Have you ever conducted

00:14:09.759 --> 00:14:10.720
any training classes?

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:13.080
Think I have

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.320
much free time and energy?

00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:15.320
You're famous.

00:14:15.399 --> 00:14:16.240
Run training classes

00:14:16.279 --> 00:14:17.080
could earn you much.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:17.840
But that'd drain

00:14:17.879 --> 00:14:19.120
my reputation real quick.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:20.840
I hardly teach

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.720
undergraduate courses.

00:14:21.879 --> 00:14:23.320
Just mentor a few graduate students.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.039
Do you know Liu Wei?

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.080
Who?

00:14:38.759 --> 00:14:41.200
Liu Wei, or Wei.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.039
A woman?

00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:43.720
A woman.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.679
Don't have such a student.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.080
She might not be your student,

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.559
but you mentored her.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.919
Do you think

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.840
I would mentor someone

00:14:54.639 --> 00:14:55.919
whose name I can't remember?

00:15:01.279 --> 00:15:03.320
This piece was mentored by you?

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.159
Really?

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.720
It's even worse than a beginner's work.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.240
Know Light Strokes?

00:15:11.399 --> 00:15:12.120
Of course, I know

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:12.720
the owner.

00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:14.360
You never went there to mentor?

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.399
Judging by skill level,

00:15:17.799 --> 00:15:18.720
if I mentored anyone,

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.759
I'd only mentor

00:15:19.759 --> 00:15:20.519
the owner.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.679
But Light Strokes

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:22.799
displays your photos.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.600
Pool halls also

00:15:23.679 --> 00:15:25.039
display Ding Junhui's photos.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.120
Are you here for

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:48.919
the interview?

00:15:49.559 --> 00:15:50.200
Look closer.

00:15:50.679 --> 00:15:51.480
Do you know her?

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:53.840
What do you want?

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:54.720
You know her,

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:55.600
right?

00:15:55.799 --> 00:15:56.399
No.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.399
Even if I did, so what?

00:15:59.919 --> 00:16:01.600
If you keep harassing me,

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:02.919
please leave.

00:16:05.639 --> 00:16:06.399
She's disappeared.

00:16:06.919 --> 00:16:08.399
Then report it to the police.

00:16:08.679 --> 00:16:09.639
The date she disappeared

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.120
coincides exactly with

00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:12.200
(Goat)
the fire at your studio.

00:16:28.879 --> 00:16:30.159
- She made this?
- Yes.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.679
At Light Strokes?

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:32.639
Yes.

00:16:33.039 --> 00:16:34.639
Tang Dynasty artist Zhou Fang's work.

00:16:35.559 --> 00:16:37.120
I had an award-winning collection

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.840
that drew inspiration from it.

00:16:39.159 --> 00:16:40.600
Many ceramic students later

00:16:40.919 --> 00:16:42.200
replicate this collection.

00:16:42.639 --> 00:16:43.440
Unfortunately,

00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:45.519
my set was destroyed

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.960
in last year's fire.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.720
But you can find images online.

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:49.960
I've seen them

00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:51.440
and compared them.

00:16:53.159 --> 00:16:53.720
Her name?

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:54.919
Wei?

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:55.840
Right?

00:16:58.759 --> 00:16:59.440
She's disappeared

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.200
and left a plate

00:17:01.559 --> 00:17:03.360
she made at Light Strokes,

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.119
imitating my work.

00:17:06.799 --> 00:17:08.240
Light Strokes displays my photos

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.319
and I know the owner.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.200
So you think

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.039
I know her?

00:17:13.039 --> 00:17:13.960
Then,

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:15.079
my studio's fire

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.799
happened around

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.880
the same time as her disappearance.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.240
So you think

00:17:20.279 --> 00:17:21.119
her disappearance

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.480
is connected to me?

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:28.039
Let's say,

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.119
you think

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.319
I'm the murderer?

00:17:33.359 --> 00:17:34.839
I killed Wei

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.519
and set the fire

00:17:36.599 --> 00:17:38.119
to burn down my own studio

00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:39.680
to ruin evidence?

00:17:41.079 --> 00:17:41.839
Is it

00:17:42.799 --> 00:17:44.119
what you call

00:17:45.279 --> 00:17:46.480
The Logic Behind Truth?

00:17:55.799 --> 00:17:56.720
Behind art

00:17:57.559 --> 00:17:58.839
lies inspiration and dedication.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.319
The Logic Behind Art.

00:18:00.319 --> 00:18:01.240
This title sounds

00:18:01.279 --> 00:18:03.079
too sensationalistic.

00:18:05.119 --> 00:18:07.000
And you only have 100,000 followers.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.240
Are you just out of content ideas

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.039
and here to pick a fight?

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.799
To be honest,

00:18:15.519 --> 00:18:16.319
I don't understand

00:18:16.319 --> 00:18:17.640
your analysis narratives,

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.759
but I at least know common sense.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.079
My studio caught fire

00:18:21.119 --> 00:18:22.640
last year in November.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.480
Today is September 30.

00:18:24.839 --> 00:18:25.839
It's been almost a year.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.720
She disappeared a year ago.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:28.920
Yet you come

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.799
to me now?

00:18:32.359 --> 00:18:33.200
Besides,

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.799
are you a police officer?

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.680
The materials used

00:18:39.759 --> 00:18:40.240
for this...

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.480
Kaolin clay.

00:18:42.039 --> 00:18:42.720
Clear glaze.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.240
The same as Light Strokes'.

00:18:44.279 --> 00:18:45.359
We use the same

00:18:45.359 --> 00:18:46.319
raw material supplier.

00:18:47.079 --> 00:18:49.119
Most ceramic artists

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.119
in Caorong City

00:18:50.359 --> 00:18:51.960
use similar materials.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.759
It's like every restaurant

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.799
serves plain rice.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.200
This plate has blemish flaws.

00:19:03.359 --> 00:19:04.640
You've studied ceramics?

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.440
Actually, blemish flaws

00:19:06.799 --> 00:19:08.079
are common

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.440
for beginners.

00:19:09.599 --> 00:19:10.799
Use this plate as an example.

00:19:11.519 --> 00:19:12.319
Its wheel throwing

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.079
and coloring

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.440
are both subpar.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.440
So the blemish flaws

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:17.839
don't matter here.

00:19:25.839 --> 00:19:26.680
Mr. Big Hui,

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.160
I think we could

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.279
end this conversation.

00:19:30.759 --> 00:19:33.000
For both of us,

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.119
(this is)

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.519
(a completely meaningless)

00:19:35.559 --> 00:19:36.759
(and useless conversation.)

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.720
(I don't understand your work.)

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:07.720
(Interesting?)

00:20:09.799 --> 00:20:10.640
Not really.

00:20:11.319 --> 00:20:12.400
I just don't have a choice.

00:20:13.359 --> 00:20:14.279
Because

00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:16.359
I don't want to get a low-paid,

00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:18.160
regular work,

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.599
or overwhelmed by high-paid work.

00:20:21.799 --> 00:20:22.720
I don't want

00:20:23.279 --> 00:20:24.359
to marry rich

00:20:24.559 --> 00:20:25.920
and live a dependent life.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.119
I don't wake up early.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.408
I love staying up late.

00:20:29.759 --> 00:20:30.519
I don't want to

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.279
work hard or slack off.

00:20:32.759 --> 00:20:33.599
Livestreaming

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.519
and making videos

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.599
are just ways I escape reality.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.200
Of course,

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.279
I fantasize that someday

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.519
I might go viral,

00:20:42.599 --> 00:20:44.039
earning quite a fortune.

00:20:45.039 --> 00:20:46.759
If I had a fortune,

00:20:47.039 --> 00:20:48.200
I could stop panicking

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:48.920
or worrying

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:49.880
for a while.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.359
Then I could really think about

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.200
how to

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.240
completely

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.000
transform myself.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.599
How?

00:21:02.319 --> 00:21:03.119
No idea yet.

00:21:04.079 --> 00:21:04.880
People like me

00:21:05.359 --> 00:21:06.240
are just worthless.

00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:10.079
But you

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:11.640
make me believe

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.119
that someone like me
can be extraordinary.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.559
So is your boyfriend?

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.079
Ex-boyfriend.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.279
He's a video creator.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.559
He works hard,

00:21:23.799 --> 00:21:25.200
collecting material, editing,

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.599
even composing original scores.

00:21:27.359 --> 00:21:28.200
He keeps updating

00:21:28.359 --> 00:21:29.559
and accumulating fans.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.400
But it's useless.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.119
There's no hope in sight.

00:21:33.839 --> 00:21:34.759
What kind of videos?

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.759
The Logic Behind Truth.

00:21:37.519 --> 00:21:38.839
Who can see the truth clearly?

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.440
Who cares about the logic?

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.559
(October 21)
It's past midnight.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.440
Want me to stay

00:21:48.119 --> 00:21:49.599
or leave?

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.119
I want you to stay.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.119
And

00:21:58.799 --> 00:22:00.200
you've never been worthless.

00:22:01.839 --> 00:22:03.559
A charming man like you

00:22:04.119 --> 00:22:05.920
must attract many women.

00:22:06.519 --> 00:22:07.200
And many women

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.440
would fall for you.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.640
Them and me,

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.319
what's the difference?

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:14.559
You're different.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.599
Believe it or not,

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.240
but I really think

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:20.599
you understand me.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.640
Many things you do

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.480
are what I wish you'd do.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.440
Many things you say

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.680
are what I want to hear.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.960
This is rare.

00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:32.359
Soulmate?

00:22:32.799 --> 00:22:34.000
I dislike that term.

00:22:34.319 --> 00:22:35.480
But it's exactly what it is.

00:22:36.599 --> 00:22:38.200
What if I pretended to be the version

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:39.480
you like

00:22:39.759 --> 00:22:40.960
just to get close to you?

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.119
How is that possible?

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.960
How could you possibly know

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.039
what kind of person I like?

00:22:51.279 --> 00:22:51.960
It seems

00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:53.759
she truly gets you.

00:22:54.359 --> 00:22:55.240
What did you say?

00:22:57.319 --> 00:22:58.079
You know what?

00:22:58.799 --> 00:22:59.880
I've fallen for you.

00:23:00.119 --> 00:23:01.039
It seems I'm destined

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.319
to fall for you.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:03.720
Though

00:23:04.359 --> 00:23:05.079
I know

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.559
you're not a good man.

00:23:11.119 --> 00:23:12.400
How am I not one then?

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:14.880
You

00:23:17.119 --> 00:23:18.240
certainly aren't.

00:23:26.944 --> 00:23:28.759
(Part-time Worker L)

00:23:28.759 --> 00:23:29.240
Say it.

00:23:29.559 --> 00:23:30.640
As you say,

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:31.960
I met your husband.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:32.960
Just do things

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.000
as I instructed.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.880
No need to update me on the details.

00:23:37.359 --> 00:23:38.319
Don't want to hear it?

00:23:38.759 --> 00:23:39.279
Fine.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.119
After it's done,

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.960
I'll give you a full report.

00:23:43.079 --> 00:23:44.319
You'd better hurry.

00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:45.759
Don't drag it out.

00:23:46.079 --> 00:23:47.079
Don't worry.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.279
Maybe

00:23:48.799 --> 00:23:50.680
your husband is more impatient than you.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.480
I can't help you

00:23:59.079 --> 00:23:59.880
with evidence.

00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:02.640
I know a lawyer in this area.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.359
You can try consulting him.

00:24:13.696 --> 00:24:15.584
(Calling...)

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.039
Hello.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.599
Zhang Ye recommended you.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.480
Zhang Ye?

00:24:24.119 --> 00:24:24.839
Got it.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.839
Divorce lawsuit?

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:26.839
What's your name?

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:29.759
Hello.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:30.839
Say something.

00:24:31.359 --> 00:24:32.200
Don't be shy.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.680
Investigate your husband?

00:24:44.039 --> 00:24:44.839
I think

00:24:45.039 --> 00:24:46.759
I should lower my hand.

00:24:52.279 --> 00:24:52.920
Take a break.

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:58.880
What can I do?

00:25:00.839 --> 00:25:02.000
My company's annual gala

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.920
requires all partners

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.640
to perform something.

00:25:06.599 --> 00:25:07.720
So I hired

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:08.839
a tutor.

00:25:09.079 --> 00:25:10.160
I come here every day.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.400
Take a seat.

00:25:12.079 --> 00:25:13.039
Just say it.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.240
You called

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.000
the person I recommended,

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.319
but hung up without saying

00:25:19.319 --> 00:25:19.880
anything.

00:25:20.079 --> 00:25:21.200
He asked me

00:25:21.359 --> 00:25:22.039
what's going on.

00:25:22.519 --> 00:25:23.960
That's it?

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.000
Sorry for troubling you.

00:25:27.839 --> 00:25:28.559
Two things.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.240
First,

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.240
it's a coincidence.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.519
I searched online for your husband.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.079
Want

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.359
to know what I found?

00:25:44.599 --> 00:25:45.799
The school forum

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.039
had a post uploaded
the day before yesterday.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.599
Your husband

00:25:49.839 --> 00:25:51.279
picked up a girl at a mall.

00:25:52.079 --> 00:25:53.079
They went to

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.359
an expensive restaurant,

00:25:55.119 --> 00:25:55.720
and

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.519
took some dishes to-go.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.799
They went to the studio
in Shuiyuan Village.

00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:02.240
After about

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.519
less than an hour,

00:26:03.599 --> 00:26:05.319
the girl called a taxi and left.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.559
She's not his student, right?

00:26:13.759 --> 00:26:15.240
Who asked you to do that?

00:26:16.079 --> 00:26:18.519
Not a colleague, I suppose.

00:26:19.039 --> 00:26:19.440
Zhang Ye.

00:26:19.759 --> 00:26:20.400
Why do this?

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.359
Doesn't seem like

00:26:21.519 --> 00:26:22.440
a business partner.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:23.240
Answer me.

00:26:23.359 --> 00:26:24.880
I told you it's a coincidence.

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:25.960
Let me tell you

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:26.920
there's more.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.240
He didn't go home

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.160
on the night of 22nd.

00:26:29.559 --> 00:26:30.559
On the morning of 23rd,

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:31.480
he went to school.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.359
At noon, he took

00:26:32.359 --> 00:26:33.319
another girl there

00:26:33.359 --> 00:26:34.400
and left in the evening.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:40.759
Take a seat.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.240
You can

00:26:54.599 --> 00:26:55.559
take these photos

00:26:56.079 --> 00:26:57.880
to start a quarrel with your husband.

00:26:58.319 --> 00:27:00.839
But if you want to use them
as evidence in a divorce lawsuit

00:27:01.839 --> 00:27:02.480
and expect him

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.119
to give up the assets,

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:05.960
that's impossible.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.759
But these photos

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.079
can prove your husband

00:27:11.319 --> 00:27:13.480
is a perfectly normal successful man.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.240
His preference for girls,

00:27:15.799 --> 00:27:18.039
especially young girls,

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.039
is perfectly normal.

00:27:21.319 --> 00:27:22.039
The studio

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.319
is where your husband

00:27:23.319 --> 00:27:24.680
frequently takes girls.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.160
The best approach

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.400
is to install cameras

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:29.119
to record it as evidence.

00:27:29.799 --> 00:27:30.799
I can investigate

00:27:31.039 --> 00:27:32.319
your husband's public behavior

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.240
for you.

00:27:33.759 --> 00:27:34.640
But I can't install

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:35.880
a candid camera for you.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.880
However, as his wife,

00:27:39.759 --> 00:27:40.519
you can do it.

00:27:42.599 --> 00:27:43.440
You could buy

00:27:43.519 --> 00:27:45.519
a security camera or similar device.

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.039
And second?

00:27:51.519 --> 00:27:53.079
Well, second.

00:28:01.319 --> 00:28:02.880
Remember this music?

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.640
Get to the point.

00:28:06.039 --> 00:28:08.799
During the New Year's party
in our sophomore year,

00:28:09.119 --> 00:28:10.400
you danced with a boy

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.839
with this exact song.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.160
All these years,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000
I've never forgotten it.

00:28:17.759 --> 00:28:19.000
May I

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.559
dance with you?

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.759
How much for the investigation?

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.680
Don't mention it.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.279
Don't worry about that.

00:28:37.839 --> 00:28:38.440
Don't interfere

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:39.200
in my affairs.

00:28:42.559 --> 00:28:43.920
Such cases are complex.

00:28:44.839 --> 00:28:45.720
Hard to get evidence

00:28:46.079 --> 00:28:46.960
and clarify disputes.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:48.992
With slim chances of winning.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.720
Ordinary lawyers

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.559
wouldn't take them.

00:28:53.079 --> 00:28:54.079
If you think

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.359
I have ulterior motives,

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.920
you're underestimating me.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:57.960
I did fancy on you,

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.400
but it's over a decade ago.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.920
Memories of youth.

00:29:01.119 --> 00:29:02.279
Just memories.

00:29:02.759 --> 00:29:03.720
I'm taking this case

00:29:03.759 --> 00:29:05.000
for only one reason.

00:29:06.279 --> 00:29:07.359
Even if I can't have you,

00:29:08.359 --> 00:29:09.160
I don't want to see

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.599
you destroyed by another man.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:25.480
Are you sure?

00:29:25.839 --> 00:29:26.759
Yes.

00:29:28.119 --> 00:29:28.920
Then...

00:29:36.519 --> 00:29:38.079
Last time, I didn't tell you the truth.

00:29:38.279 --> 00:29:39.359
I know Zeng Jie

00:29:39.359 --> 00:29:40.519
has been having an affair.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:41.519
That's why

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:42.480
I called

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.720
the number you left me.

00:29:44.839 --> 00:29:45.920
You're still hesitating.

00:29:46.799 --> 00:29:47.680
Haven't decided to

00:29:47.839 --> 00:29:48.480
investigate him?

00:29:49.319 --> 00:29:50.119
What's the point?

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.359
Even if you helped me

00:29:51.359 --> 00:29:52.680
take those photos, so what?

00:29:53.799 --> 00:29:54.359
You said,

00:29:54.839 --> 00:29:55.799
those photos cannot be

00:29:55.839 --> 00:29:57.160
used as legitimate evidence.

00:29:57.759 --> 00:29:58.359
You also said

00:29:58.599 --> 00:30:00.000
it is extremely complex.

00:30:00.519 --> 00:30:01.720
Evidence and clarification...

00:30:02.079 --> 00:30:02.559
I have

00:30:02.759 --> 00:30:03.759
no experience in these.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.920
These are all within my expertise.

00:30:11.119 --> 00:30:12.079
Can you win?

00:30:12.839 --> 00:30:13.559
Can you make

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:14.920
Zeng Jie end up with nothing?

00:30:16.519 --> 00:30:17.279
No, you can't.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:19.920
From the very start

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.119
of this lawsuit,

00:30:21.599 --> 00:30:22.799
I've been on the losing side.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.680
If we don't try,

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.759
you won't have a chance to win.

00:30:27.359 --> 00:30:28.279
What chance do I have?

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.680
Zhang Ye, stop persuading me.

00:30:31.279 --> 00:30:32.359
I've thought it through.

00:30:34.079 --> 00:30:35.000
What's your plan?

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.160
It's my plan.

00:30:39.519 --> 00:30:40.200
Stop

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.400
interfering in my affairs

00:30:42.519 --> 00:30:44.160
and stay out of my life.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.640
I know you won't

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:50.200
listen to me.

00:30:50.599 --> 00:30:51.920
But don't negotiate with him.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.200
If he gets warned,

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.319
it will get messier.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.359
Need help,

00:30:55.519 --> 00:30:56.440
contact me anytime.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:27.799
We're doing our best.

00:31:28.119 --> 00:31:28.799
We could

00:31:28.839 --> 00:31:29.519
save her life.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.119
But I can't guarantee her legs

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.000
can be saved.

00:31:42.279 --> 00:31:43.200
(So, after this fire,)

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.359
(I made up my mind.)

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.119
The interview is out?

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:51.640
Yes.

00:31:53.519 --> 00:31:54.240
Flowers.

00:31:58.359 --> 00:31:59.960
Chose a ruin for the interview?

00:32:00.279 --> 00:32:01.759
You're quite imaginative.

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.880
That reporter is quite attractive.

00:32:06.519 --> 00:32:07.640
Does she also

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.119
admire you?

00:32:12.559 --> 00:32:13.400
Just an intern.

00:32:13.839 --> 00:32:14.680
A young girl.

00:32:15.119 --> 00:32:15.880
Nothing remarkable.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.440
Am I not a young girl?

00:32:19.079 --> 00:32:20.039
You're a young woman.

00:32:29.319 --> 00:32:31.519
I heard when the fire started,

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:32.928
you ran to the third floor

00:32:33.759 --> 00:32:35.480
to look for your wife

00:32:35.559 --> 00:32:37.039
before escaping.

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:38.720
Who told you that?

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.160
It's been all over Shuiyuan Village
since the fire.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.279
How's your wife doing?

00:32:45.408 --> 00:32:46.688
Don't you have to stay with her?

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.359
I'll bring her

00:32:49.759 --> 00:32:50.799
some food tonight.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.759
She might not eat it.

00:32:53.319 --> 00:32:54.200
She's been sleeping

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:54.920
most of the time.

00:32:56.039 --> 00:32:57.440
Spend New Year's Eve with her?

00:32:59.559 --> 00:33:01.279
You asked me to accompany you.

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:04.319
Fine.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.279
I'll go with you.

00:33:06.759 --> 00:33:08.599
After you finish playing
the devoted husband,

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.880
we'll go enjoy a meal
and the New Year's Eve.

00:33:15.072 --> 00:33:18.432
(Central Hospital)

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.440
My dad's been pressuring me again.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:40.960
About what?

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.159
Studying abroad.

00:34:44.119 --> 00:34:44.800
Actually,

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.280
as the daughter

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.599
of Caorong University's principal,

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.280
you should have gone abroad.

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:51.239
So, he's still

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:52.199
doing this for himself.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.360
When I was young, he divorced my mom

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.559
and never cared about me.

00:34:56.079 --> 00:34:56.800
Now he suddenly

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.760
wants me to study abroad
to make him proud.

00:34:59.039 --> 00:34:59.679
Why should I?

00:35:00.079 --> 00:35:01.599
It's for your future.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:02.679
Think about it.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.480
Now you're at the university

00:35:04.519 --> 00:35:05.320
with a cushy job.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.199
But there's

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:08.639
no real room

00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:09.480
for advancement.

00:35:09.639 --> 00:35:10.519
Thank you.

00:35:10.639 --> 00:35:12.119
I don't even want this cushy job.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.440
Work like a retired old lady.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:15.960
I bet

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:16.960
I'll quit

00:35:17.039 --> 00:35:18.000
the job soon.

00:35:30.119 --> 00:35:32.039
Feeling guilty leaving your wife

00:35:32.639 --> 00:35:33.760
at the hospital?

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.599
I just visited her.

00:35:37.679 --> 00:35:39.199
Poor thing.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.079
Falling for your tricks.

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.800
She should've been vigilant
before marrying you.

00:35:48.599 --> 00:35:50.079
Why do you keep bringing her up?

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:56.039
Maybe I'm jealous.

00:35:56.519 --> 00:35:57.920
Before meeting her,

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:58.639
I thought

00:35:58.639 --> 00:36:00.000
she's some frumpy housewife.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.360
But you brought her

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.400
to the alumni banquet.

00:36:03.679 --> 00:36:04.639
She's the most stunning

00:36:04.719 --> 00:36:05.480
there.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
If you didn't lie

00:36:07.039 --> 00:36:08.599
about being divorced,

00:36:09.039 --> 00:36:11.000
I'd never date you.

00:36:15.559 --> 00:36:16.960
I told you before

00:36:17.719 --> 00:36:18.360
our love

00:36:18.519 --> 00:36:19.719
has gone.

00:36:20.639 --> 00:36:22.119
I only love you.

00:36:23.719 --> 00:36:25.079
Save your breath.

00:36:25.639 --> 00:36:26.519
I never wanted

00:36:26.639 --> 00:36:27.800
to disrupt your life.

00:36:28.599 --> 00:36:29.599
But now...

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:31.320
Now, you're

00:36:31.519 --> 00:36:33.039
a perfectionist

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.039
trapped in an imperfect marriage.

00:36:35.559 --> 00:36:37.119
Don't you feel awful?

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.880
Don't you want to escape it?

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.079
It makes me feel awful.

00:36:51.519 --> 00:36:52.559
We're both unlucky.

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:54.679
Such a marriage

00:36:56.119 --> 00:36:57.000
is like

00:36:57.639 --> 00:36:58.679
a blemish flaw

00:36:59.199 --> 00:37:00.280
on a ceramic.

00:37:01.199 --> 00:37:01.960
Everything else

00:37:02.119 --> 00:37:03.159
appears flawless,

00:37:04.199 --> 00:37:05.079
but one blemish flaw

00:37:05.599 --> 00:37:06.599
ruins its value.

00:37:08.079 --> 00:37:09.119
And it

00:37:09.519 --> 00:37:10.760
becomes defective.

00:37:11.559 --> 00:37:12.800
And defective things

00:37:13.639 --> 00:37:14.519
are worthless.

00:37:28.159 --> 00:37:29.320
It's hard to find you.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.559
With all the New Year's fireworks

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:34.800
out there.

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:38.679
I had plans

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:39.760
with friends for a party.

00:37:40.719 --> 00:37:42.079
But before leaving,

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:43.960
I saw an interview

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.239
of your husband online.

00:37:45.559 --> 00:37:47.360
So I texted you,

00:37:48.519 --> 00:37:49.400
but got no reply.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.559
Called twice, yet you hung up.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.360
So I

00:37:53.239 --> 00:37:54.760
got concerned.

00:37:57.199 --> 00:37:58.000
This place is nice.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.719
When I broke my legs two years ago,

00:38:00.832 --> 00:38:01.880
I was hospitalized here.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.559
It's pricey, but

00:38:04.199 --> 00:38:04.960
nice facilities.

00:38:05.199 --> 00:38:06.000
Right?

00:38:08.559 --> 00:38:09.559
No flowers?

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:11.199
I brought some.

00:38:16.559 --> 00:38:17.079
Smells good.

00:38:17.679 --> 00:38:18.320
They're fresh.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.199
You must think

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.519
I deserve this.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.320
Before coming,

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:32.360
I had a hunch

00:38:32.599 --> 00:38:35.480
your husband wouldn't spend
the New Year's Eve with you.

00:38:35.719 --> 00:38:36.239
Of course,

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:37.679
if he were here,

00:38:37.679 --> 00:38:38.679
I'd just leave

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:39.960
after taking a peek.

00:38:41.159 --> 00:38:42.239
But I was right.

00:38:44.519 --> 00:38:45.119
Normal.

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.039
On such a romantic day,

00:38:50.519 --> 00:38:51.559
he wouldn't miss it.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.320
The news said your accident

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:01.840
happened around

00:39:02.159 --> 00:39:03.800
December 20?

00:39:04.119 --> 00:39:05.440
The news reported it.

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:06.320
Why ask me?

00:39:06.519 --> 00:39:07.800
After our last meeting,

00:39:09.039 --> 00:39:10.519
you discussed with your husband?

00:39:11.199 --> 00:39:12.639
I just wanted him

00:39:13.039 --> 00:39:13.679
to return

00:39:13.679 --> 00:39:15.239
a portion of the fund

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:15.920
to my parents.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.280
Is that wrong?

00:39:19.199 --> 00:39:20.000
No.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.039
But

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.199
you did it wrong.

00:39:25.519 --> 00:39:26.360
I've warned you.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:27.039
but I knew

00:39:27.239 --> 00:39:28.679
you wouldn't listen to me.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.199
By confronting him,

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:31.440
he'd be alert.

00:39:32.039 --> 00:39:32.840
And

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:35.280
I never expected

00:39:37.519 --> 00:39:38.599
him to be this ruthless.

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.320
What do you mean?

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.079
Bai Xiaoling,

00:39:45.519 --> 00:39:46.559
do you think your accident

00:39:46.599 --> 00:39:47.760
isn't related to him?

00:39:48.199 --> 00:39:49.920
Zeng Jie wants you dead!

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:56.960
It's not like that.

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:58.960
This was an accident.

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.199
Of course, it was.

00:40:00.239 --> 00:40:01.239
If it weren't,

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:02.559
he'd be in prison already.

00:40:04.119 --> 00:40:05.000
Listen,

00:40:06.079 --> 00:40:06.800
I came here

00:40:07.199 --> 00:40:08.199
to hear your side.

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.320
I believe this case

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.719
might be a premeditated murder.

00:40:13.039 --> 00:40:14.159
You're overthinking it.

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.639
I know you care about me,

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:17.800
but right now,

00:40:18.199 --> 00:40:19.559
I don't care about anything.

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.320
I don't care about

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.639
divorce or assets.

00:40:24.519 --> 00:40:25.960
I just want my...

00:40:32.119 --> 00:40:33.079
Thank you

00:40:33.599 --> 00:40:35.239
for visiting me

00:40:35.639 --> 00:40:36.800
and trying to help.

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:40.159
But I don't need it.

00:40:45.519 --> 00:40:46.480
I deleted your contact.

00:40:47.159 --> 00:40:48.800
From now on,

00:40:49.599 --> 00:40:50.199
please

00:40:50.639 --> 00:40:52.000
do not contact me.

00:40:54.679 --> 00:40:55.599
Accepting fate now?

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.159
Bai Xiaoling,

00:41:00.119 --> 00:41:01.199
this isn't you.

00:41:04.079 --> 00:41:04.920
I'm no longer

00:41:05.079 --> 00:41:06.440
the person I used to be.

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:10.760
Your injuries

00:41:14.119 --> 00:41:14.960
are serious.

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.719
This has nothing to do with him.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.119
It was an accident.

00:41:26.159 --> 00:41:27.480
I won't say things like

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:29.480
"Contact me

00:41:29.559 --> 00:41:31.159
if you need help."

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.320
Happy New Year!

00:42:06.848 --> 00:42:08.377
It's very likely she's gone.

00:42:09.632 --> 00:42:10.409
Zeng Jie.

00:42:10.784 --> 00:42:11.648
Sorry, one more.

00:42:11.648 --> 00:42:12.832
Remove it.

00:42:12.832 --> 00:42:16.562
He needs a fire to destroy...

00:42:16.608 --> 00:42:19.168
What's the line? I keep forgetting it.

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:21.312
But they don't eat there.

00:42:22.816 --> 00:42:23.893
What's wrong with me?

00:42:25.312 --> 00:42:27.584
Doesn't seem like a business partner.

00:42:27.584 --> 00:42:28.448
Answer me.

00:42:28.448 --> 00:42:29.676
I told you it's a...

00:42:32.352 --> 00:42:33.068
Sorry.

00:42:34.304 --> 00:42:36.160
Okay? Let's take another one.

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:37.120
3, 2...

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.584
It isn't a bank deposit.

00:42:41.728 --> 00:42:42.632
How soon?

00:42:43.712 --> 00:42:46.112
It isn't a bank deposit.

00:42:46.112 --> 00:42:48.245
We can't get cash just...

00:42:48.288 --> 00:42:49.403
