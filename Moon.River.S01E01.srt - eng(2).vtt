00:00:19.438 --> 00:00:22.272
A man named Yeonghochaek

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:27.281
once dreamed that he spoke with someone
beneath the ice while standing above it.

00:00:28.505 --> 00:00:31.501
The fortune teller Sekdam
interpreted the dream as follows.

00:00:32.538 --> 00:00:35.872
'Above the ice represents yang
and below the ice yin,'

00:00:35.872 --> 00:00:42.005
'so it's a matter of man and woman,
of balance and fate.'

00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:44.372
'You shall act as a matchmaker,'

00:00:44.372 --> 00:00:48.813
'and when the ice melts, there will be a wedding.'

The story of Jinseo's
art exhibition 'Glacier Person'.

00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:18.738
That must've been sent by Samsin.

00:01:18.738 --> 00:01:23.538
Have you been well, Elder Wolha?

00:01:23.538 --> 00:01:27.705
This is the register of those chosen by Samsin.

00:01:27.705 --> 00:01:30.338
Perfect timing.

00:01:30.338 --> 00:01:33.805
Shall we try blooming the flowers now?

[Kang Woo Yeon, Lee Soo]

00:02:23.838 --> 00:02:27.338
Wow, these are fate blossoms, aren't they?

00:02:27.338 --> 00:02:30.272
But why are some flowers white

00:02:30.272 --> 00:02:32.272
and others red?

00:02:32.272 --> 00:02:35.738
Fate blossoms are naturally white,

00:02:35.738 --> 00:02:39.409
but when those bound by the Red Thread
recognize each other,

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.061
they bloom crimson red.

00:02:44.738 --> 00:02:49.838
But why is that flower a different color?

00:02:49.838 --> 00:02:52.672
When humans are born,

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:56.109
they each carry their own destined connections.

00:02:58.872 --> 00:03:03.738
Those destined for each other
are connected by red threads around their wrists

00:03:03.738 --> 00:03:06.638
to help recognize their fated partners.

00:03:07.272 --> 00:03:10.538
We call this the Red Thread of Fate.

00:03:11.313 --> 00:03:13.745
Those intertwined by the Red Thread

00:03:13.745 --> 00:03:17.312
will find each other through any hardship

00:03:17.312 --> 00:03:20.379
no matter what obstacles arise.

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.896
Even if it takes multiple lifetimes,

00:03:23.845 --> 00:03:29.079
they'll meet in this life
or the next without fail.

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.179
Wow.

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:33.345
So the Red Thread always wins in the end?

00:03:33.345 --> 00:03:35.012
Not quite.

00:03:35.012 --> 00:03:37.245
Protecting one's destined bond

00:03:37.245 --> 00:03:41.579
requires far greater effort than you imagine.

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.045
The world holds more darkness

00:03:46.045 --> 00:03:48.645
and wicked people than you know.

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:52.612
Then why give such difficult fates?

00:03:52.612 --> 00:03:55.879
Though love doesn't always conquer all,

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.745
it fortifies the human spirit.

00:03:59.745 --> 00:04:04.512
That is why I weave their ties.

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:25.712
Those two flowers too,

00:04:25.712 --> 00:04:27.945
- It's beautiful.
- once bloomed for a pair

00:04:27.945 --> 00:04:30.779

00:04:32.312 --> 00:04:33.779
Did you know?

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:36.412
If you catch a falling petal,

00:04:36.412 --> 00:04:38.609
your first love will come true.

00:04:38.609 --> 00:04:40.079
Really?

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:42.812
Then who will be your first love, my lady?

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:23.045
Had they followed the path
their Red Thread had set,

00:05:23.045 --> 00:05:26.779
they would have lived happily ever after.

00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:32.812

00:05:32.812 --> 00:05:37.145
such a tragic shattering

00:05:37.145 --> 00:05:39.879

00:06:12.712 --> 00:06:15.512
I dreamed something truly ominous.

00:06:20.645 --> 00:06:24.817

[Master Royal Tailor]
Is there a problem with the dragon robe?

00:10:02.545 --> 00:10:05.579

00:15:00.645 --> 00:15:02.145
With due respect,

00:15:02.145 --> 00:15:06.279
may I ask who LM's daughter is?

00:15:06.279 --> 00:15:08.079
You don't know LM's daughter?

00:15:08.079 --> 00:15:09.479
Goodness.

00:15:09.479 --> 00:15:12.045
How ignorant you all are.

00:15:12.045 --> 00:15:13.545
CP is LM's daughter.

00:15:13.545 --> 00:15:17.679
After all, Crown Princess
is Left Minister's daughter.

00:15:17.679 --> 00:15:20.679
I've already made up my mind about it.

00:15:26.312 --> 00:15:28.624
Crown Prince has issued the Marriage Ban Edict.

00:15:29.745 --> 00:15:33.445
If Crown Prince marries your daughter

00:15:33.445 --> 00:15:34.548
and they have a son, the royal heir,

00:15:34.548 --> 00:15:35.945
[First Grandson: Eldest son of Crown Prince
not yet designated as heir]

00:15:35.945 --> 00:15:38.379
[King Lee Hui]
do you intend to kill Crown Prince then?

00:15:38.379 --> 00:15:42.576
Or make him a madman like me
to be locked away in the palace?

00:15:44.212 --> 00:15:47.504
Your jest goes too far, Your Majesty.

00:15:50.079 --> 00:15:51.545
A jest...

00:15:51.545 --> 00:15:54.512
Do I look like I'm jesting to you right now?

00:15:58.279 --> 00:16:00.112
Yes.

00:16:00.112 --> 00:16:03.856
I called it a jest, so a jest it is.

00:16:04.612 --> 00:16:09.379
And I said Your Majesty's health is frail,

00:16:09.379 --> 00:16:12.145
therefore, Your Majesty's health is frail.

00:16:12.145 --> 00:16:17.312
I also said Your Majesty's madness has worsened,

00:16:17.312 --> 00:16:21.679
therefore, Your Majesty is unfit to rule.

00:16:21.679 --> 00:16:22.779
Left Minister!

00:16:22.779 --> 00:16:28.016
Then why did you aspire to become the true king?

00:16:37.479 --> 00:16:40.979
Goodness, why did they grow so large?

00:16:46.945 --> 00:16:51.612
Goldfish are creatures that grow
endlessly based on their environment.

00:16:51.612 --> 00:16:52.812
Is that so?

00:16:52.812 --> 00:16:55.245
'Is that so?'

00:16:55.245 --> 00:16:56.245
Incredible.

00:16:56.245 --> 00:17:00.145
I explicitly ordered all aquatic creatures
to be exterminated.

00:17:00.145 --> 00:17:02.579
Yet you seem familiar with
that insignificant creature?

00:17:02.579 --> 00:17:03.679
Do you know this goldfish?

00:17:03.679 --> 00:17:07.979
This fish was originally raised
in Grand Queen Dowager's hall,

00:17:07.979 --> 00:17:10.512
but Her Majesty ordered it discarded.

00:17:10.512 --> 00:17:14.312
Even a lowly creature deserves life.

00:17:14.312 --> 00:17:17.379
I couldn't let it perish.

00:17:20.912 --> 00:17:23.279
Please end me, Your Highness.

00:17:23.279 --> 00:17:26.512
- Please end me, Your Highness.
- Please end me, Your Highness.

00:17:30.979 --> 00:17:34.345
Do not speak of death so lightly.

00:17:34.345 --> 00:17:36.848
Especially when I'm near the water.

00:17:38.379 --> 00:17:42.212
That goldfish breathes
and darts about freely in the water,

00:17:42.212 --> 00:17:44.412
but when a person enters it,

00:17:44.412 --> 00:17:47.888
their breath stops and they die.

00:17:49.112 --> 00:17:53.212
Left too long, they bloat and decay.

00:17:53.212 --> 00:17:58.645
A mere touch could reduce them to nothing.

00:17:58.645 --> 00:17:59.945
Kill m...

00:17:59.945 --> 00:18:03.912
No, please show mercy!

00:18:03.912 --> 00:18:06.712
Please show mercy

00:18:06.712 --> 00:18:09.328
and spare me.

00:18:13.079 --> 00:18:14.545
The Classic of Governance states,

00:18:14.545 --> 00:18:16.545
'Spread benevolence widely.'

00:18:16.545 --> 00:18:19.845
'No matter where people live,
are they not bound to meet someday?'

00:18:19.845 --> 00:18:21.745
Therefore,

00:18:21.745 --> 00:18:23.512
I shall show you mercy.

00:18:23.512 --> 00:18:25.279
Your grace overwhelms me.

00:18:25.279 --> 00:18:30.480
But you must transcribe
'Admonitions for the Heart' to atone.

00:18:31.612 --> 00:18:33.345
Pardon?

00:18:37.012 --> 00:18:38.812
After the deposed consort's passing,

00:18:38.812 --> 00:18:42.545
His Highness developed
hatred for all aquatic life.

00:18:42.545 --> 00:18:45.345
I gave strict warnings.

00:18:45.345 --> 00:18:47.279
You should be grateful copying
is your only punishment.

00:18:47.279 --> 00:18:49.879
If you mean that consort,

00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:52.945
wasn't she executed with poison

00:18:52.945 --> 00:18:55.112
over the queen's assassination incident?

00:18:55.112 --> 00:18:59.216
What connection does that have with water?

00:19:01.912 --> 00:19:07.845
She received the poison,
but protested innocence by drowning herself.

00:19:07.845 --> 00:19:11.612
His Highness personally
identified the corpse, left so long that

00:19:11.612 --> 00:19:14.945
it had decomposed beyond recognition.

00:19:14.945 --> 00:19:18.145
How could one not feel resentment
toward the water?

00:19:18.812 --> 00:19:22.712
One cannot help but hate
the creatures swimming within it.

00:19:46.179 --> 00:19:48.945
[Five years ago]
She would never kill herself.

00:19:48.945 --> 00:19:51.979
Someone murdered her and staged it as suicide.

00:19:51.979 --> 00:19:55.312
Please prove her innocence.

00:19:55.312 --> 00:19:57.545
She did take her own life.

00:19:57.545 --> 00:19:59.279
Why would she do such a thing?

00:19:59.279 --> 00:20:03.245
What possible reason could she have?

00:20:03.245 --> 00:20:04.979
I...

00:20:06.312 --> 00:20:07.985
ordered it.

00:20:15.012 --> 00:20:16.212
What do you...

00:20:16.212 --> 00:20:20.745
Had she lived, you'd have fled holding her hand.

00:20:20.745 --> 00:20:23.012
If I gave her poison,

00:20:23.012 --> 00:20:25.412
you'd have drunk it in her place.

00:20:25.412 --> 00:20:27.745
I commanded her

00:20:28.745 --> 00:20:31.312
to die in your stead.

00:20:32.945 --> 00:20:35.412
You were protected by your mother, your consort,

00:20:35.412 --> 00:20:38.312
and your father-in-law's blood.

00:20:38.312 --> 00:20:40.592
Never forget the weight of your life.

00:20:41.579 --> 00:20:44.245
I never wished for this.

00:20:45.612 --> 00:20:48.412
For whom did they die?

00:20:50.545 --> 00:20:53.424
I'm already shattered,

00:20:54.912 --> 00:20:57.488
yet for whom did they perish?

00:21:05.812 --> 00:21:08.579
I died long ago.

00:21:08.579 --> 00:21:11.545
It was Your Majesty who killed me.

00:21:42.579 --> 00:21:44.912
You must've been so cold.

00:21:45.645 --> 00:21:48.012
You were scared, weren't you?

00:21:53.579 --> 00:21:55.632
But don't worry anymore.

00:21:57.345 --> 00:21:59.344
I'll be there soon.

00:22:25.745 --> 00:22:27.512
Why...

00:22:28.679 --> 00:22:32.079
Why?

00:22:33.645 --> 00:22:36.561
We still need you, Your Highness.

00:22:36.561 --> 00:22:40.145
For now, please live.

00:22:40.812 --> 00:22:45.279
When I say it is done,
you may then give up your life.

00:22:45.279 --> 00:22:49.879
This is the new law of the palace.

00:22:49.879 --> 00:22:53.379
Do you think I'll comply?

00:22:53.379 --> 00:22:56.212
Do you think I will meekly step aside

00:22:56.212 --> 00:22:58.945
so your daughter may sit in the consort's chambers

00:22:58.945 --> 00:23:02.145
and her bloodline may take the throne?

00:23:02.145 --> 00:23:04.845
You must.

00:23:04.845 --> 00:23:08.145
That's exactly why I killed the queen

00:23:08.145 --> 00:23:11.088
and framed the deposed consort.

00:23:13.745 --> 00:23:16.312
Now that all's done,

00:23:16.312 --> 00:23:19.379
why reveal the truth?

00:23:19.379 --> 00:23:25.012
Because knowing changes nothing, Your Highness.

00:23:25.012 --> 00:23:28.579
None dare punish me.

00:23:28.579 --> 00:23:31.579
No, none will punish me.

00:23:31.579 --> 00:23:34.712
There would be countless people

00:23:34.712 --> 00:23:37.945
in this court who'd die in my place.

00:23:37.945 --> 00:23:39.679
So that's why

00:23:40.479 --> 00:23:44.879
you chose to kill yourself
instead of taking revenge.

00:23:47.779 --> 00:23:50.012
How weak.

00:23:52.279 --> 00:23:54.345
You rat.

00:23:56.145 --> 00:23:59.679
You rat!

00:24:05.212 --> 00:24:10.712
No one fears anger driven by cowardice.

00:24:10.712 --> 00:24:13.776
Weakness is cowardice, and helplessness is sin.

00:24:15.345 --> 00:24:17.579
Become stronger.

00:24:22.779 --> 00:24:26.912
Only strength embodies justice in this world.

00:24:54.645 --> 00:24:57.479
Your Highness.

00:24:57.479 --> 00:24:59.145
Are you alright?

00:24:59.145 --> 00:25:01.245
I'll summon the royal physician.

00:25:03.879 --> 00:25:05.712
I'm fine.

00:25:46.645 --> 00:25:48.712
I miss you.

00:26:08.912 --> 00:26:10.571
[Uljin]

00:26:14.512 --> 00:26:16.612
Buy some fish.

00:26:16.612 --> 00:26:18.412
Get your pollock.

00:26:18.412 --> 00:26:22.379
- Take a look.
- We have pollock.

00:26:23.378 --> 00:26:26.188
Hey, watch where you going.

00:26:29.679 --> 00:26:32.312
Excuse me.

00:26:32.312 --> 00:26:33.745
Hello.

00:26:33.745 --> 00:26:35.179
Yes.

00:26:35.179 --> 00:26:37.445
Just passing through.

00:26:39.512 --> 00:26:42.012
It's been a while.

00:26:42.012 --> 00:26:44.845
Oh, have you eaten?

00:26:47.545 --> 00:26:51.012
I'm scared of fish eyes.

00:26:53.045 --> 00:26:55.545
Aren't you running a business?

00:26:55.545 --> 00:26:59.079
What've you been looking for so leisurely?

00:26:59.079 --> 00:27:02.212
Where's the biggest house here?

00:27:02.212 --> 00:27:04.045
That house there.

00:27:08.945 --> 00:27:11.279
Is anyone home?

00:27:11.279 --> 00:27:13.245
What's going on?

00:27:16.412 --> 00:27:20.712
A cup of water shouldn't be too much
to ask in such a grand house, right?

00:27:26.812 --> 00:27:28.812
I really enjoyed the water.

00:27:28.812 --> 00:27:32.245
Not a mountain hare or anything,
are you really just drinking water and leaving?

00:27:32.245 --> 00:27:33.912
Not selling anything?

00:27:33.912 --> 00:27:36.445
Buyers know what they want.
How should the seller know?

00:27:36.445 --> 00:27:40.612
I need to know what you're selling
to decide whether to buy.

00:27:40.612 --> 00:27:43.945
Forget it. You'd have mentioned earlier
if you needed something.

00:27:43.945 --> 00:27:46.545
I really enjoyed the water.

00:27:47.379 --> 00:27:49.479
Wait.

00:27:50.412 --> 00:27:52.745
Then...

00:27:52.745 --> 00:27:54.812
shall I unpack?

00:27:57.145 --> 00:27:59.845
I'm not even saying a word.

00:27:59.845 --> 00:28:03.412
This salt is speaking. Listen carefully.

00:28:05.545 --> 00:28:06.645
Huh?

00:28:06.645 --> 00:28:08.512
Hey.

00:28:09.379 --> 00:28:11.479
The salt speaks.

00:28:14.845 --> 00:28:18.345
'I'm premium-grade salt.'

00:28:18.345 --> 00:28:22.545
'You're a fool if you don't buy me.'

00:28:22.545 --> 00:28:24.612
Oh, my.

00:28:41.445 --> 00:28:44.312
Oh, thank you.

00:28:51.312 --> 00:28:53.779
It's salt.

00:28:53.779 --> 00:28:55.645
Oh, my.

00:29:07.412 --> 00:29:11.445
♪ Going, going, when are we going ♪

00:29:11.445 --> 00:29:15.512
♪ Twelve hills, when will we cross ♪

00:29:15.512 --> 00:29:17.112
Did you sell a lot today?

00:29:17.112 --> 00:29:19.412
I emptied an entire jar of salt.

00:29:19.412 --> 00:29:23.045
♪ Twelve hills, when will we cross ♪

00:29:23.045 --> 00:29:27.179

00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:43.345
Hey! Are you okay?

00:29:46.979 --> 00:29:48.512
What do you think you're doing?

00:29:48.512 --> 00:29:50.545
I almost got hurt.

00:29:50.545 --> 00:29:54.479
Oh! Did you already know?

00:29:54.479 --> 00:29:57.312
I thought you didn't know
and was trying to inform you.

00:29:57.312 --> 00:29:58.979
You know the saying,

00:29:58.979 --> 00:30:02.879
'A stone thrown in jest
killed the load-carrying porter.'

00:30:02.879 --> 00:30:04.412
What nonsense is that?

00:30:04.412 --> 00:30:05.579
Maybe for frogs.

00:30:05.579 --> 00:30:09.779
Frog, merchant, or noble,
soft flesh bruises all the same.

00:30:09.779 --> 00:30:11.445
- Apologize.
- Nonsense.

00:30:11.445 --> 00:30:13.279
The law of rank is strict.

00:30:13.279 --> 00:30:15.779
How can a noble apologize to a lowly porter?

00:30:15.779 --> 00:30:20.245
Yes, I may be ignorant
and know nothing of the laws of rank,

00:30:20.245 --> 00:30:22.312
but I understand basic human decency.

00:30:22.312 --> 00:30:26.245
Whether noble or commoner,
wrongdoers must apologize.

00:30:26.245 --> 00:30:29.912
And if they still can't grasp that,
there's only one solution.

00:30:29.912 --> 00:30:31.679
The stick is the remedy!

00:30:31.679 --> 00:30:34.645
Oh, my! That lowborn wretch is attacking a noble!

00:30:34.645 --> 00:30:37.845
Those little brats act like they're highborn.

00:30:37.845 --> 00:30:40.379
I'm the grown-up here, so I'm holding back.

00:30:44.712 --> 00:30:48.312
When life's rough, this is the best thing.

00:30:50.045 --> 00:30:51.312
What? Huh?

00:30:51.312 --> 00:30:52.745

00:30:52.745 --> 00:30:54.812
Father.

00:30:54.812 --> 00:30:57.612

How'd you know?

00:30:58.612 --> 00:31:02.212
Every time you're upset,
you blow those soap bubbles

00:31:02.212 --> 00:31:03.979
from that Western merchant, right?

00:31:03.979 --> 00:31:06.812
It's so expensive that I'm not allowed
to blow them, only you are.

00:31:06.812 --> 00:31:09.612
Blowing this helps me feel a bit better.

00:31:09.612 --> 00:31:11.612
I'm still upset.

00:31:11.612 --> 00:31:14.512
This can't go on.

00:31:20.079 --> 00:31:21.345
I'll charge at them.

00:31:21.345 --> 00:31:24.579
There, there.

00:31:24.579 --> 00:31:27.479
Enough. You've rolled both sleeves up. Go.

Jeez.

00:31:33.612 --> 00:31:36.279
Forget it.

00:31:36.279 --> 00:31:38.945
I step aside because it's filth,
not because I'm scared.

00:31:38.945 --> 00:31:41.779
Yeah, that's the right way to think.

00:31:41.779 --> 00:31:45.545
You can't solve everything
in this world with violence.

00:31:45.545 --> 00:31:49.279
Just think of it as poop and move on.

00:31:49.279 --> 00:31:53.812
In Joseon, the fate of nobles
and commoners is worlds apart.

00:31:53.812 --> 00:31:57.679
These social classes have deep roots.

00:31:59.079 --> 00:32:01.012
But here's the thing.

00:32:01.012 --> 00:32:04.079
If I was born lowly from the start

00:32:04.079 --> 00:32:07.812
and got used to being treated poorly,
maybe I could accept it.

00:32:07.812 --> 00:32:09.512
As you both know, Mother and Father,

00:32:09.512 --> 00:32:14.179
when I almost drowned years ago,
my entire memory was washed away.

00:32:14.179 --> 00:32:16.779
My mind is clouded, my memories dark,

00:32:16.779 --> 00:32:19.612
and yet I woke up to discover I'm a lowborn.

00:32:19.612 --> 00:32:23.045
I can't even tell whether I'm noble or commoner,
and yet they call me a commoner.

00:32:23.045 --> 00:32:25.345
How am I supposed to adjust to this?

00:32:25.345 --> 00:32:26.579
How can I not be resentful?

00:32:26.579 --> 00:32:27.879
Do you think I could sleep after all that?

00:32:27.879 --> 00:32:31.179
Fine. Go make your money quick, buy yourself
a certificate of rank, and become a noble.

00:32:31.179 --> 00:32:33.445
Stop worrying about us for nothing.

00:32:33.445 --> 00:32:34.845
If I have the money,
I'd spend it on something fun.

00:32:34.845 --> 00:32:38.012
Why burn so much money on that scrap of paper?

00:32:38.012 --> 00:32:42.779
I'll make a fortune and go to the West.

00:32:42.779 --> 00:32:45.912
They say everyone's equal under the sky there.

00:32:45.912 --> 00:32:47.412
Oh.

00:32:47.412 --> 00:32:50.712
Is the West supposed to be Utopia?

00:32:50.712 --> 00:32:54.445
But in Utopia, isn't Hong Gildong playing king?

00:32:54.445 --> 00:32:57.879
That punk who couldn't call his father
properly builds a country,

00:32:57.879 --> 00:33:00.712
shouts 'equality for all'

00:33:00.712 --> 00:33:03.245

00:33:03.245 --> 00:33:06.345
That's the way of the world.

00:33:06.345 --> 00:33:09.045
Why crush your only daughter's dreams?

00:33:09.045 --> 00:33:11.245
Ow! Why hit me? Why the violence?

00:33:11.245 --> 00:33:13.279
Why's everyone always using violence?

00:33:13.279 --> 00:33:16.812
If that's how you're going to be,
then go to your West.

00:33:16.812 --> 00:33:20.912
But before you go,
you've got to stop by the next village.

00:33:20.912 --> 00:33:21.945
Why there?

00:33:21.945 --> 00:33:23.279
You know who's there.

00:33:23.279 --> 00:33:25.612
That old naval commander.

00:33:25.612 --> 00:33:27.279
Mr. Heo wants to see you.

00:33:27.279 --> 00:33:28.812
Why's that old man looking for me?

00:33:28.812 --> 00:33:32.212
How should I know why? Go ask him yourself.

00:33:32.212 --> 00:33:35.179
I'll go over there.

My daughter who married into Hanyang
keeps appearing in my dreams, crying bloody tears.

00:33:47.512 --> 00:33:53.009
Maybe she's bitter about being widowed
so young. She weeps so bitterly.

00:33:55.945 --> 00:34:01.645
Recently she even sent a letter saying
she'll follow her dead husband to the grave.

00:34:01.645 --> 00:34:04.479
If the dreams are violent,
you should call a shaman.

00:34:04.479 --> 00:34:08.345
I'm already busy. Stop going around in circles
and just say what you mean.

00:34:08.345 --> 00:34:10.545
- It's impossible anyway.
- What is?

00:34:10.545 --> 00:34:14.212
Are you asking me to go to Hanyang
and check on the young lady's well-being?

00:34:14.212 --> 00:34:17.879
So you're asking me to disguise
as a peddler and stop by,

if someone from her family visits, right?

So there is a shaman here after all.

00:34:25.212 --> 00:34:27.879
Well, no.

00:34:27.879 --> 00:34:31.079

It's not about the money,

00:35:07.779 --> 00:35:09.512
Right?

00:35:14.445 --> 00:35:16.345
Thank you. Yes.

Now's the time to convince me, isn't it?

What can be done?

We can't bring back a married woman.

Even if we did,

00:36:12.879 --> 00:36:16.245
could my young girl withstand society's scorn?

00:36:16.245 --> 00:36:19.779
But why should the desire
to live be met with disdain?

00:36:19.779 --> 00:36:23.545
If a person just wants to live,
how can that be wrong?

00:36:23.545 --> 00:36:26.345
Even if you stop me, this time, I won't back down.

00:54:56.479 --> 00:55:00.112
Oh, my, oh, my.

00:55:00.112 --> 00:55:03.279
Oh, my stomach.

00:55:03.279 --> 00:55:05.779
Oh, no, it's coming out.

00:55:11.679 --> 00:55:14.312
Even so, I'm a woman.

00:55:14.312 --> 00:55:17.145
How could I possibly do my business
in front of a man?

00:55:18.079 --> 00:55:21.812
I won't look, so don't you worry, okay?

00:55:21.812 --> 00:55:23.645
There.

00:55:35.845 --> 00:55:38.445
Wait, what's that noise?

00:55:38.445 --> 00:55:41.845
Pooping into the chamber pot... really?

00:55:41.845 --> 00:55:43.679
What lies could my backside possibly tell?

00:55:43.679 --> 00:55:45.979
When nature calls, it answers.

00:55:45.979 --> 00:55:49.345
By the way, this is ten-day aged stuff.
Plug your nose tight.

00:55:49.345 --> 00:55:50.745
You won't be able to hold it.

00:55:50.745 --> 00:55:53.679
Oh, wait!

00:55:53.679 --> 00:55:55.912
Oh, for goodness.

00:55:55.912 --> 00:55:57.145
What now?

00:55:57.145 --> 00:56:00.612
Should I sit? Stand?

00:56:01.412 --> 00:56:03.245
Stand up.

00:56:31.479 --> 00:56:33.712
What a lively rhythm.

00:56:33.712 --> 00:56:35.845
Ours truly is the best.

00:56:35.845 --> 00:56:37.712
Don't you agree?

00:56:52.012 --> 00:56:54.812
You just praised the local pride,

00:56:54.812 --> 00:56:57.145
but why go stealing foreign goods?

00:56:57.145 --> 00:56:59.745
Did you miss your little brother this much?

00:56:59.745 --> 00:57:01.645
You came all the way here after me?

00:57:01.645 --> 00:57:04.945
You dare steal my clock and flee to Qing?

00:57:04.945 --> 00:57:09.345
Did you think I'd forgive you
after a month of hiding?

00:57:09.345 --> 00:57:10.945
This isn't yours, brother. It's mine.

00:57:10.945 --> 00:57:12.812
I bought it with my own money.
My money, my purchase.

00:57:12.812 --> 00:57:14.645
But I ordered it first!

00:57:14.645 --> 00:57:16.945
Ah, don't you remember?

00:57:16.945 --> 00:57:18.579
Our long-standing rule between you and me.

00:57:18.579 --> 00:57:19.912
First to claim keeps it.

00:57:19.912 --> 00:57:24.579
Didn't you snatch my telescope last time?

00:57:25.245 --> 00:57:28.679
Cut the smug talk and hand it over, now.

00:57:31.412 --> 00:57:33.112
It's...

00:57:37.045 --> 00:57:38.545
Broken.

00:57:38.545 --> 00:57:41.579
How could something
that expensive break so easily?

00:57:41.579 --> 00:57:43.145
When it broke,

00:57:43.145 --> 00:57:45.512
I thought my heart was breaking with it.

00:57:45.512 --> 00:57:46.579
Oh, no, what now?

00:57:46.579 --> 00:57:50.345
Everyone out! Get out now!

00:57:52.912 --> 00:57:55.479
- You want to die?
- Well...

00:57:55.479 --> 00:57:59.545
Why take it if you can't protect it properly?

00:58:07.345 --> 00:58:10.091
Get over here! Let go!

00:58:10.091 --> 00:58:11.986
You!

00:58:24.212 --> 00:58:25.936
They left.

00:58:26.845 --> 00:58:29.545
Five years passed, and you still can't act?

00:58:29.545 --> 00:58:32.579
Is playing a thug so hard
you can't fool one minister?

00:58:32.579 --> 00:58:34.679
My natural grace...

00:58:34.679 --> 00:58:35.745
That's not it.

00:58:35.745 --> 00:58:40.245
Your Highness is none other than
the greatest madman of all time.

00:58:40.245 --> 00:58:42.279
You are the very embodiment

00:58:42.279 --> 00:58:45.045
of a reckless, thuggish scoundrel.

00:58:45.045 --> 00:58:47.512
Left Minister just suspects too much.

00:58:47.512 --> 00:58:49.079
Hey, give me the sword. Now.

00:58:49.079 --> 00:58:51.845
You punk.

00:58:51.845 --> 00:58:54.812
You want a taste of my blade?

00:59:08.512 --> 00:59:10.544
Don't fret too much.

00:59:11.145 --> 00:59:14.479
If I perform the sword dance,

00:59:14.479 --> 00:59:17.136
it will be for Left Minister alone.

00:59:20.279 --> 00:59:23.279
I'll sever his head,

00:59:23.279 --> 00:59:26.608
and avenge Her Majesty the Queen
and Crown Princess.

00:59:27.779 --> 00:59:28.779
It appears Prince Je Woon

00:59:28.779 --> 00:59:31.245
intercepted the treasure Crown Prince

00:59:31.245 --> 00:59:33.479
ordered from Qing a month ago.

00:59:33.479 --> 00:59:37.040
He seems to have spent a month in Qing
avoiding Crown Prince's wrath.

00:59:40.712 --> 00:59:44.479
They're just callow kids
squabbling over toys at best.

00:59:44.479 --> 00:59:46.845
Why be so on guard?

00:59:48.412 --> 00:59:52.048
Genghis Khan's driving force
was paternal vengeance.

00:59:53.379 --> 00:59:57.812
Are you saying Crown Prince
aspires to be Genghis Khan?

00:59:57.812 --> 01:00:00.712
Crown Prince lost his consort,

01:00:00.712 --> 01:00:05.145
and I turned Prince Je Woon's mother
into a vengeful ghost.

01:00:05.145 --> 01:00:08.048
Both surely bear grudges against me.

01:00:09.379 --> 01:00:13.112
Doubt builds sturdier walls than stone,

01:00:13.112 --> 01:00:17.520
and vengeance forges the sharpest blade.

01:00:20.279 --> 01:00:23.645
[Woman]

01:00:23.645 --> 01:00:26.112
Stop fooling around.

01:00:26.745 --> 01:00:29.245
I'm working here.

01:00:30.579 --> 01:00:32.445
Working here.

01:00:40.545 --> 01:00:42.912
Wait, why are you...

01:00:49.612 --> 01:00:51.879
That... catch that gisaeng.

01:00:51.879 --> 01:00:53.945
The one in straw sandals.

01:00:53.945 --> 01:00:55.712
By order of Prince Je Woon.

01:00:55.712 --> 01:00:58.279
- Move aside.
- Catch her.

01:00:59.879 --> 01:01:02.179
Catch that gisaeng.

01:01:04.462 --> 01:01:06.445
Oh, darn it.

01:01:06.445 --> 01:01:08.712
Sorry! I'm sorry!

01:01:08.712 --> 01:01:10.445
Someone catch her!

01:01:10.445 --> 01:01:13.245
This is Prince Je Woon's command!

01:01:15.312 --> 01:01:17.332
Someone catch her!

01:01:17.332 --> 01:01:19.252
Get her!

01:01:22.712 --> 01:01:25.079
Someone catch her!

01:01:27.828 --> 01:01:30.100
Hey, wait!

01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:32.945
- She's on the roof!
- What's happening?

01:01:32.945 --> 01:01:36.912
Underestimate a porter's stamina
and you'll regret it.

01:01:36.912 --> 01:01:38.545
Wait, that's...

01:01:38.545 --> 01:01:39.545
Hold on.

01:01:39.545 --> 01:01:42.145
- What's wrong?
- Just leave me alone.

01:01:45.748 --> 01:01:47.534
Geez.

01:01:52.845 --> 01:01:56.812
Underestimate a servant's persistence,

01:01:56.812 --> 01:01:59.440
- and you'll end up badly hurt.
- Geez.

01:02:00.312 --> 01:02:02.945
Don't go any further.

01:02:06.645 --> 01:02:09.012
It's nothing serious.

01:02:09.012 --> 01:02:10.445
About Dal I.

01:02:10.445 --> 01:02:13.779
Why must she avoid Hanyang?

01:02:13.779 --> 01:02:16.112
It's just my sudden curiosity.

01:02:16.112 --> 01:02:18.045
Didn't I tell you?

01:02:18.045 --> 01:02:20.176
She's a fugitive slave from Hanyang.

01:02:20.945 --> 01:02:23.664
Slave hunters still hunt her.

01:02:25.712 --> 01:02:27.779
Tell me straight.

01:02:27.779 --> 01:02:30.960
Dal I isn't just a slave, right?

01:02:32.212 --> 01:02:33.945
What's her true identity?

01:02:33.945 --> 01:02:35.812
Dal I is...

01:02:39.479 --> 01:02:41.745
Could Dal I have gone to Hanyang?

01:02:41.745 --> 01:02:43.979
No.

01:02:44.812 --> 01:02:47.879
Hanyang? Why would...

01:02:47.879 --> 01:02:50.012
She went to Pyongyang. Pyongyang.

01:02:50.012 --> 01:02:52.145
Mark my words.

01:02:52.145 --> 01:02:54.679
Dal I must never

01:02:54.679 --> 01:02:57.212
set foot in Hanyang.

01:03:00.479 --> 01:03:02.379
Stop following me.

01:03:02.379 --> 01:03:03.445
Wait.

01:03:03.445 --> 01:03:06.312
If you fall again here, you could die.

01:03:06.312 --> 01:03:09.379
Don't move, seriously.

01:03:09.379 --> 01:03:11.445
Come with me now,

01:03:11.445 --> 01:03:14.879
and I'll keep this from Prince Je Woon.

01:03:14.879 --> 01:03:16.612
Prince Je Woon?

01:03:16.612 --> 01:03:18.379
If he's a prince...

01:03:19.012 --> 01:03:20.712
The one who brought me here was a royal relative?

01:03:20.712 --> 01:03:22.745
[Royal Relative: A member of the king's family]
If he were just a royal relative, you'd be lucky.

01:03:22.745 --> 01:03:26.245
He's the late king's only legitimate son.

01:03:27.079 --> 01:03:30.512
Still, it's a gibang alright,
but why is it so noisy here?

01:03:30.512 --> 01:03:33.179
Jeez.

01:03:33.179 --> 01:03:38.245
If you resist, I'll report everything
to Prince Je Woon.

01:03:41.112 --> 01:03:43.012
Better to die

01:03:44.079 --> 01:03:45.812
than suffer.

01:04:12.745 --> 01:04:14.479
Huh?

01:04:19.612 --> 01:04:22.779
So, what will happen?

01:04:24.645 --> 01:04:27.212
She will die.

01:04:27.212 --> 01:04:29.212
His Majesty will send you poison.

01:04:29.212 --> 01:04:31.879
You must flee, Your Highness.

01:04:35.745 --> 01:04:44.179
♫ Oh, will my love return to me ♫

01:04:44.179 --> 01:04:53.512
♫ Oh, how futile all becomes ♫

01:04:54.379 --> 01:04:57.445
♫ All but a dream ♫

01:05:04.512 --> 01:05:06.512
No one

01:05:06.512 --> 01:05:09.212
must recognize

01:05:12.945 --> 01:05:14.212
her.

01:05:14.212 --> 01:05:21.512
♫ Oh, how futile all becomes ♫

01:05:21.512 --> 01:05:25.912
♫ Born of dreams, living and dying in dreams ♫

01:05:25.912 --> 01:05:29.579
♫ It's all for naught ♫

01:05:30.245 --> 01:05:39.812
♫ What use is dreaming such dreams ♫

01:06:03.279 --> 01:06:05.645
- I missed you, my lady.
- Oh, my.

01:06:05.645 --> 01:06:07.645
You have parents? Since when?

01:06:07.645 --> 01:06:09.412
Since I was born, of course.

01:06:09.412 --> 01:06:13.145
Or do you know what happens

01:06:13.145 --> 01:06:15.212
if you catch a falling petal?

01:06:15.212 --> 01:06:18.645
If you catch a falling petal...

01:06:18.645 --> 01:06:21.145
She seems entangled in grave matters.

01:06:21.145 --> 01:06:23.445
Let go. Let go of me!

01:06:23.445 --> 01:06:25.379
If I sort this out...

01:06:25.379 --> 01:06:26.879
Where is she, that girl?

01:06:26.879 --> 01:06:29.045
Will you answer me?

01:06:29.045 --> 01:06:31.445
Where is that girl!
