[Lee Hui]

Die for the Crown Prince.

00:02:22.172 --> 00:02:23.972
Your Highness.

00:02:23.972 --> 00:02:25.438
Your Highness.

00:02:25.438 --> 00:02:27.538
Your Highness!

00:02:37.472 --> 00:02:40.205
Your Highness.

00:02:40.205 --> 00:02:41.772
Your Highness.

Crown Princess.

00:02:46.138 --> 00:02:48.338
Crown Princess.

00:03:01.472 --> 00:03:02.505
Your Highness.

00:03:02.505 --> 00:03:04.938
Your Highness.

00:03:04.938 --> 00:03:06.705
Crown Princess.

00:03:06.705 --> 00:03:09.838
Your Highness.

00:03:12.672 --> 00:03:16.205
This is the mark left by a sealed Red Thread.

00:03:16.205 --> 00:03:17.672
The Red Thread?

00:03:17.672 --> 00:03:22.238
Everyone is born with a Red Thread
tied to their destiny.

00:03:22.238 --> 00:03:25.405
Each person's fate is tied by the thread
that connects them.

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:27.938
Since her Red Thread has been sealed,

00:03:27.938 --> 00:03:31.921
all past connections and memories
must have vanished.

00:03:32.538 --> 00:03:33.905
Are you saying...

00:03:33.905 --> 00:03:38.938
The first person she sees
upon waking will shape her memories,

00:03:38.938 --> 00:03:41.572
so cover it up carefully.

00:03:41.572 --> 00:03:46.305
People instinctively seek what they've lost.

00:03:46.305 --> 00:03:50.305
So be careful she doesn't recover the memories

00:03:50.305 --> 00:03:54.225
she struggled to erase and doesn't reunite

00:03:56.772 --> 00:03:58.938
with that lost connection.

00:03:58.938 --> 00:04:01.038
Since the thread was severed once,

00:04:01.038 --> 00:04:04.625
they'll be drawn together with even greater force.

00:04:15.605 --> 00:04:19.205
Your Highness. Your Highness.

00:04:54.638 --> 00:04:56.753
Who are you?

00:04:58.738 --> 00:05:03.038
You lost your memories after nearly drowning.

00:05:03.038 --> 00:05:06.438
Your name is Park Dal I, and I'm your aunt.

00:05:06.438 --> 00:05:08.338
Well, not by blood,

00:05:08.338 --> 00:05:11.825
but you are family to someone dear to me.

00:05:16.538 --> 00:05:19.805
Originally a slave from a noble Hanyang household,

00:05:19.805 --> 00:05:24.405
you fled at age five when slave hunters
killed your parents and kin,

00:05:24.405 --> 00:05:26.449
leaving you

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.738
as the sole survivor.

00:05:31.672 --> 00:05:33.841
You must

00:05:33.841 --> 00:05:36.049
never return to Hanyang.

00:05:40.405 --> 00:05:42.838
Park

00:05:42.838 --> 00:05:44.785
Dal

00:05:45.457 --> 00:05:47.409
I.

00:05:49.972 --> 00:05:53.585
Wait here. Don't move.

00:06:30.838 --> 00:06:34.772
The corpse is badly decomposed,
so it's hard to identify the face.

00:06:34.772 --> 00:06:37.905
May Your Highness confirm it personally.

00:06:37.905 --> 00:06:39.825
I refuse.

00:06:39.825 --> 00:06:42.105
I won't do it.

00:06:42.105 --> 00:06:44.872
How can I verify a corpse

00:06:44.872 --> 00:06:47.938
that's not my crown princess?

00:06:58.705 --> 00:07:01.138
Look properly.

00:07:01.138 --> 00:07:05.073
Is this the deposed Crown Princess Kang?

00:07:45.505 --> 00:07:48.805
If I perform the sword dance,

00:07:48.805 --> 00:07:51.569
it will be for Left Minister alone.

00:07:54.638 --> 00:07:57.672
I'll sever his head,

00:07:57.672 --> 00:08:00.838
and avenge Her Majesty the Queen
and Crown Princess.

00:08:00.838 --> 00:08:03.305
I've been curious from the start.

00:08:03.305 --> 00:08:05.472
Why focus specifically on the Gyesa Year incident?

00:08:05.472 --> 00:08:08.338
If it's about avenging
Crown Princess and the Queen,

00:08:08.338 --> 00:08:11.672
shouldn't we be digging into
the Queen's poisoning?

00:08:11.672 --> 00:08:13.905
We tried all of that

00:08:15.372 --> 00:08:17.738
and failed.

00:08:18.938 --> 00:08:21.948
Anyone even slightly involved

00:08:21.948 --> 00:08:23.772
is already dead.

00:08:23.772 --> 00:08:27.272
After losing Crown Princess, I thought every day.

00:08:27.272 --> 00:08:29.809
Where should I start to make things right?

00:08:30.672 --> 00:08:32.605
The Queen Mother's death.

00:08:32.605 --> 00:08:34.738
The Gyesa Year incident.

00:08:34.738 --> 00:08:35.889
[Secret Affair: Illicit relationship]
The false adultery accusation

[between unmarried lovers]
against Queen Mother Jangjeong.

00:08:38.138 --> 00:08:40.305
Where should I start to turn things around?

00:08:40.305 --> 00:08:43.672
After long contemplation, I realized.

00:08:43.672 --> 00:08:46.305
A fired arrow can't be recalled,

00:08:46.305 --> 00:08:49.172
time flows like arrows.

00:08:49.172 --> 00:08:51.772
If it can't be undone,

00:08:52.705 --> 00:08:55.938
then the only option is
to cut off the enemy's breath.

00:08:59.438 --> 00:09:02.305
Prime Minister Han Su Hoon,
Minister of Public Works Han Chi Hoon.

The first person to report the death of
the Queen Dowager's brothers, Kim Han Cheol.

00:09:06.638 --> 00:09:09.272
Received acupuncture to replenish vitality,
then passed away.

00:09:09.272 --> 00:09:10.638
Royal Physician Lee Dong Hyun.

00:09:10.638 --> 00:09:12.238
On the 7th day of the 10th month
in the Gyesa Year,

00:09:12.238 --> 00:09:15.105
Kim Han Cheol recommended
Lee Dong Hyun to the Royal Physician.

00:09:15.105 --> 00:09:16.605
On the 1st day of 9th month in the Gyesa Year,

00:09:16.605 --> 00:09:17.745
[Mi Hour: 1 PM to 3 PM, Shin hour: 3 PM to 5 PM]
the crown prince passed away during Mi hour,

00:09:17.745 --> 00:09:20.305
and the late king passed away during Shin hour.

00:09:20.305 --> 00:09:25.105
[Oh Hour: 11 AM to 1 PM]
Their wooden sword practice was during Oh hour.

00:09:25.105 --> 00:09:27.438
The one who prepared
those wooden swords at that time,

00:09:27.438 --> 00:09:32.705
Shigwangwon, Crown Prince's Officer
Kim Han Cheol, Left Minister.

00:09:43.605 --> 00:09:45.905
The dawn of absolute power.

00:09:45.905 --> 00:09:48.005
The Gyesa Year incident.

00:09:58.372 --> 00:09:59.572
Your Highness.

00:09:59.572 --> 00:10:03.305
What brings Your Highness to this humble place?

00:10:05.572 --> 00:10:08.005
I intend to use that chamber.

00:10:08.005 --> 00:10:09.772
Make it comfortable for living

00:10:09.772 --> 00:10:12.272
and set aside a space for physicians to work.

00:10:12.272 --> 00:10:16.638
I'm sorry to ask, but for
what purpose do you intend to use it?

00:10:16.638 --> 00:10:19.072
Why are you calling the physicians here again?

00:10:19.072 --> 00:10:21.638
True beauty stems from health.

00:10:21.638 --> 00:10:25.638
A sound inner self
naturally enhances outer radiance.

00:10:25.638 --> 00:10:31.205
The Master Royal Tailor who handles
such beauty should know better than that.

00:10:37.072 --> 00:10:42.172
But are you sure the physicians are competent?

00:10:42.172 --> 00:10:46.405
I heard real, first-rate physicians
know how to handle poisons well.

00:10:46.405 --> 00:10:48.272
Of course.

00:10:48.272 --> 00:10:50.105
That would be the case, right?

00:10:50.738 --> 00:10:53.905
Ask me about any poison.

00:10:56.905 --> 00:10:58.405
Now, then,

00:10:58.405 --> 00:10:59.738
this deadly poison, which can cause instant death

00:10:59.738 --> 00:11:01.105
with just a splinter of wood,

00:11:01.105 --> 00:11:05.572
a single acupuncture needle,
or even a sip of alcohol,

00:11:05.572 --> 00:11:06.905
yet shows no reaction to silver

00:11:06.905 --> 00:11:09.405
and does not cause the body
to turn black and decay.

00:11:09.405 --> 00:11:14.673
What could this poison be?

00:11:15.572 --> 00:11:18.001
Where in the world is there such a poison?

00:11:19.938 --> 00:11:21.205
Get out.

00:11:21.205 --> 00:11:23.105
A splinter of wood...

00:11:23.105 --> 00:11:24.805
- Out.
- A single acupuncture needle.

00:11:24.805 --> 00:11:27.605
- Get out.
- A sip

00:11:27.605 --> 00:11:29.672
of alcohol...

00:11:29.672 --> 00:11:32.205
- Out.
- It's deadly poison...

00:11:32.205 --> 00:11:33.272
Out.

00:11:33.272 --> 00:11:35.738
Yet shows no reaction to silver...

00:11:35.738 --> 00:11:36.938
Out!

00:11:36.938 --> 00:11:39.205
- Not cause the body to turn black
- Out.

00:11:39.205 --> 00:11:40.972
and decay.

00:11:40.972 --> 00:11:43.338
Out!

00:11:43.338 --> 00:11:49.005
What could this poison be?

00:11:50.772 --> 00:11:53.072
Such poison in this world...

00:11:53.072 --> 00:11:55.872
- Your Highness.
- Out!

00:11:55.872 --> 00:11:57.617
Out!

00:11:57.617 --> 00:11:58.673
Your Highness.

00:11:58.673 --> 00:12:00.605
Everyone said they didn't know,

00:12:00.605 --> 00:12:03.705
but those who occasionally
added something all said the same thing.

00:12:03.705 --> 00:12:06.738
Where in the world is there such a poison?

00:12:06.738 --> 00:12:08.972
Well, unless you mean a Zhen poison...

00:12:08.972 --> 00:12:11.633
Your Highness, please.

00:12:11.633 --> 00:12:14.065
[Zhen bird]
The Poison of the Zhen bird.

00:12:14.065 --> 00:12:15.265
It's the Zhen poison.

00:12:15.265 --> 00:12:18.665
However, isn't the Zhen bird a mythical creature
conceived in ancient China?

00:12:18.665 --> 00:12:21.099
Left Minister exploited that very point.

00:12:21.099 --> 00:12:24.165
Ghosts and legends are just fanciful tales.

00:12:24.165 --> 00:12:27.065
It's as if they've created a story that
the people will find even more fascinating.

00:12:27.065 --> 00:12:30.699
If it were real, we'd need to investigate in Qing.

00:12:30.699 --> 00:12:33.532
It would be dangerous for Your Highness
to conduct the investigation personally.

00:12:33.532 --> 00:12:35.232
We need allies outside the palace.

00:12:35.232 --> 00:12:37.099
I agree.

00:12:37.099 --> 00:12:38.899
It would be better if they were someone

00:12:38.899 --> 00:12:41.532
who saw it as their own revenge rather than mine.

00:12:41.532 --> 00:12:44.465
Are you Prince Je Woon from Sinjusa?

00:12:44.465 --> 00:12:47.465
That's correct, but who are you?

00:12:47.465 --> 00:12:49.532
I'm the Crown Prince.

00:12:51.265 --> 00:12:55.065
Despite being reinstated by His Majesty's grace,

00:12:55.065 --> 00:12:57.465
I've shamefully neglected to pay respects.

00:12:57.465 --> 00:12:59.565
Please kill me.

00:13:01.365 --> 00:13:04.165
You despise me, right?

00:13:04.165 --> 00:13:07.132
You despise His Majesty and Left Minister, right?

00:13:09.732 --> 00:13:11.899
Raise your head.

00:13:14.132 --> 00:13:16.865
I've come to borrow that heart of yours.

00:13:16.865 --> 00:13:19.599
Will you join me in my revenge?

00:13:23.332 --> 00:13:27.665
So, what did you gain from this trip to Qing?

00:13:27.665 --> 00:13:32.432
After searching, I found an old neighbor
of the man who raised the Zhen bird.

00:13:32.432 --> 00:13:34.099
According to the elderly man from Qing,

00:13:34.099 --> 00:13:39.399
the person boasted that he sold the Zhen bird
for a large sum during the Imjin Year.

00:13:39.399 --> 00:13:41.665
Your Highness.

00:13:41.665 --> 00:13:45.799
Left Minister led a delegation to Qing that year.

00:13:45.799 --> 00:13:47.132
Indeed.

00:13:47.132 --> 00:13:50.699
As Minister of War back then,
his cargo wouldn't be inspected.

00:13:50.699 --> 00:13:54.565
And he could have brought in bizarre creatures
like the Zhen bird without anyone noticing.

00:13:54.565 --> 00:13:56.965
That old man may also be involved.

00:13:56.965 --> 00:13:59.857
Inform me as soon as you receive word from Qing.

00:14:02.532 --> 00:14:05.432
I'll send someone tomorrow to fetch the clock.

00:14:05.432 --> 00:14:07.165
I've already told you.

00:14:07.165 --> 00:14:08.732
The clock is broken.

00:14:08.732 --> 00:14:10.199
Bring even the pieces.

00:14:10.199 --> 00:14:11.965
I'll claim I broke it.

00:14:11.965 --> 00:14:13.765
Why go that far?

00:14:13.765 --> 00:14:17.499
Left Minister knows
we fought over the clock, right?

00:14:17.499 --> 00:14:20.065
If I return empty-handed,

00:14:20.065 --> 00:14:22.665
he'll think I lost to you.

00:14:22.665 --> 00:14:24.199
But remember,

00:14:24.199 --> 00:14:27.799
I don't lose.

00:14:27.799 --> 00:14:30.732
Wow, he's really full of himself.

00:14:34.532 --> 00:14:37.632
Still, it's a gibang alright,
but why is it so noisy here?

00:14:37.632 --> 00:14:40.165
Yoon Se Dol, don't change the topic.

00:14:40.165 --> 00:14:43.099
Better to die than suffer.

00:15:18.865 --> 00:15:23.208

Ugh, thank you.

00:16:24.665 --> 00:16:26.232
Of course not.

Can she even be touched?

What have you been yammering about all this time?

Give me back my clothes, you thief!

I told you not to think about running.

Give it back. My identity tag.

Yes, from the Boryeong Park family. I'm a porter.

Why did you go all the way to Boryeong?

A slave?

But why are you going there?

00:21:19.699 --> 00:21:22.632
Because I took on a certain role.

Like a debt collector scarier than tigers.

00:21:31.732 --> 00:21:34.632
Is it possible that the Crown Princess didn't die

00:21:34.632 --> 00:21:37.384
and was sold into servitude as a palace slave?

00:21:38.699 --> 00:21:43.599
The body decayed in water too long,
so I couldn't verify the face properly.

Even on the slightest chance...

My apologies.

00:21:57.332 --> 00:22:01.099
Your Highness, that porter
can't possibly be Her Highness.

00:22:01.099 --> 00:22:03.032
If she truly were Her Highness,

00:22:03.032 --> 00:22:06.999
she'd be a traitor who refused
the royal poison and fled.

00:22:06.999 --> 00:22:08.765
That makes her a grave criminal.

00:22:08.765 --> 00:22:12.065
If that girl really is her,

00:22:12.065 --> 00:22:14.632
if only she's still alive...

00:22:14.632 --> 00:22:17.032
I just want to grab that hand and run away.

00:22:18.399 --> 00:22:21.096
But if that girl isn't my lady,

00:22:21.765 --> 00:22:25.416
if she's truly just a porter or a runaway slave,

00:22:27.299 --> 00:22:29.384
that girl will die.

00:26:43.699 --> 00:26:45.499
Stop.

00:26:47.699 --> 00:26:49.565
Why are you doing this? Let us go.

00:26:49.565 --> 00:26:51.432
If I let you go,

00:26:52.299 --> 00:26:53.532
where would you go?

00:26:53.532 --> 00:26:55.132
How far do you think you'll get?

00:26:55.132 --> 00:26:58.999
Even if that girl survives,
do you think you'll be safe?

00:26:58.999 --> 00:27:01.532
It doesn't matter, so step aside and leave us be.

00:27:01.532 --> 00:27:02.865
It's already too late.

00:27:02.865 --> 00:27:06.332
- Miss.
- Miss.

00:27:20.599 --> 00:27:22.499
It's all

00:27:24.499 --> 00:27:26.399
over now.

00:27:29.565 --> 00:27:32.832
No, you can't take her.

00:27:34.199 --> 00:27:37.832
You're accomplices in this too.

00:27:38.499 --> 00:27:43.165
If anything happens to the young lady,
half the blame falls on you, understand?

00:27:45.499 --> 00:27:47.965
- Escort the young lady.
- Yes.

00:27:47.965 --> 00:27:49.965
Come this way, young lady.

00:27:49.965 --> 00:27:51.132
Young lady, wait a moment.

00:27:51.132 --> 00:27:52.865
Young lady.

00:27:52.865 --> 00:27:54.632
Let me go, please.

00:27:54.632 --> 00:27:56.465
No.

00:28:08.665 --> 00:28:12.599
You're worse than them, my lord.

00:28:12.599 --> 00:28:17.199
They serve masters who hold their lives,

00:28:17.199 --> 00:28:19.665
but you are only siding with the highborn

00:28:19.665 --> 00:28:22.999
because of some ridiculous law.

00:28:25.665 --> 00:28:28.264
I heard you're a runaway slave from Hanyang.

00:28:29.365 --> 00:28:31.065
Who said such a...

00:28:31.065 --> 00:28:36.104
If you want to hide your status,
fix that thick Hanyang accent first.

00:28:36.932 --> 00:28:39.232
So,

00:28:39.232 --> 00:28:41.599
are you threatening me with my identity now?

00:28:41.599 --> 00:28:43.032
I'm not blaming you.

00:28:43.032 --> 00:28:45.672
Nor am I here to punish you.

00:28:47.199 --> 00:28:49.448
You're very lucky.

00:28:50.632 --> 00:28:53.160
Having met me with that face.

00:28:54.032 --> 00:28:56.232
I'll give you the money you wanted.

00:28:56.232 --> 00:28:59.132
So step away from this matter
and leave Hanyang immediately.

00:28:59.132 --> 00:29:01.032
Why would you give me money?

00:29:01.032 --> 00:29:03.499
Isn't that why you're acting like this,
for the money?

00:29:03.499 --> 00:29:04.932
- What is this...
- A silver dagger.

00:29:04.932 --> 00:29:07.732
The Records of Virtuous Women,
Anthology of Suicides, The Tale of Chun Hyang.

00:29:07.732 --> 00:29:09.999
- That's...
- Telling others to become chaste women.

00:29:09.999 --> 00:29:13.732
You sell all these items encouraging suicide.

00:29:13.732 --> 00:29:16.132
Don't you hate seeing women you know die?

00:29:16.132 --> 00:29:18.399
Do merchants have no scruples at all?

00:29:18.399 --> 00:29:20.565
It's for disguise.

00:29:20.565 --> 00:29:22.365
Why would I sell such things?

00:29:22.365 --> 00:29:23.465
'Such things'?

00:29:23.465 --> 00:29:25.765
If someone wants to die, you should stop them.

00:29:25.765 --> 00:29:28.499
Not praise them by publishing
some 'The Records of Virtuous Women.'

00:29:28.499 --> 00:29:31.848
If you hold a blade, stab the villain.
Why cut your own throat?

00:29:39.165 --> 00:29:40.465
What a novel interpretation.

00:29:40.465 --> 00:29:43.599
What would Chun Hyang,
the model of chastity, say to that?

00:29:43.599 --> 00:29:47.999
Oh look, another noble
who only knows Chun Hyang by name.

00:29:47.999 --> 00:29:49.665
Listen carefully.

00:29:49.665 --> 00:29:55.365
What Chun Hyang protected
wasn't chastity, but herself.

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:03.083
[The Tale of Chun Hyang]

00:30:05.199 --> 00:30:07.099
- You enjoy that book?
- Yes.

00:30:07.099 --> 00:30:11.272
I never knew you cared
so much about chastity, my lady.

00:30:13.399 --> 00:30:16.199
Or is this some kind of signal?

00:30:16.199 --> 00:30:18.577
The content was quite indecent.

00:30:22.499 --> 00:30:26.132
Is that all you saw in The Tale of Chun Hyang?

00:30:26.132 --> 00:30:28.999
I feel like you scold me every day.

00:30:28.999 --> 00:30:31.532
What Chun Hyang tried to protect

00:30:31.532 --> 00:30:34.532
wasn't chastity, but dignity.

00:30:35.799 --> 00:30:39.565
Chastity was merely a tool.

00:30:40.532 --> 00:30:43.532
A tool to protect her own worth.

00:30:45.499 --> 00:30:47.399
A tool?

00:30:50.065 --> 00:30:52.299
It was a tool to protect herself
from Magistrate Byeon,

00:30:52.299 --> 00:30:55.532
who insisted she was a courtesan for his own lust,

00:30:55.532 --> 00:30:58.665
even though he knew she wasn't.

00:30:58.665 --> 00:31:02.888
A kind of armor against a cruel world.

00:31:03.532 --> 00:31:07.065
Where did you hear that story?

00:31:07.065 --> 00:31:10.665
I didn't hear it anywhere. It's my own thought.

00:31:10.665 --> 00:31:13.032
That can't be.

00:31:13.865 --> 00:31:17.065
Do you think we lowborn people
have no thoughts of our own?

00:31:20.165 --> 00:31:22.232
Then,

00:31:22.232 --> 00:31:25.099
do you know what happens

00:31:28.132 --> 00:31:30.499
if you catch a falling petal?

00:31:31.565 --> 00:31:34.312
If I catch a falling petal...

00:31:41.799 --> 00:31:44.049
If I catch a falling petal...

00:31:51.265 --> 00:31:54.465
Why should I tell that to you?

00:31:54.465 --> 00:31:55.899
I'll take my leave now.

00:31:55.899 --> 00:32:00.081
I don't wish to exchange words
with rude petty men like you.

00:32:04.732 --> 00:32:07.299
If I resolve this matter,

00:32:07.299 --> 00:32:09.032
will you answer me?

00:32:09.032 --> 00:32:10.032
What?

00:32:10.032 --> 00:32:12.465
If I resolve this matter,

00:32:13.232 --> 00:32:15.699
will you give me an answer?

00:32:17.432 --> 00:32:20.532
I'll take your silence as a yes.

00:32:20.532 --> 00:32:22.465
First, get treated.

00:32:22.465 --> 00:32:25.576
That wound bothers me.

00:32:33.032 --> 00:32:34.165
What are you doing?

00:32:34.165 --> 00:32:35.932
Let go. What is this?

00:32:35.932 --> 00:32:38.465
Let go of me. Why are you doing this?

00:32:38.465 --> 00:32:40.832
Why treat me like luggage?

00:32:40.832 --> 00:32:43.032
Where are you taking me?

00:32:43.032 --> 00:32:44.865
Why this? Oh, my.

00:32:44.865 --> 00:32:48.165
The treatment's all finished,
but why are you stopping me?

00:32:48.165 --> 00:32:51.332
The lord who brought you said to keep you here

00:32:51.332 --> 00:32:53.232
until he returns.

00:32:53.232 --> 00:32:55.565
I said I'm leaving.

00:32:55.565 --> 00:32:58.432
Why should I be bound by
a complete stranger's words?

00:32:58.432 --> 00:33:00.799
That's not my concern.

00:33:00.799 --> 00:33:04.265
He left without paying.

00:33:06.565 --> 00:33:09.832
Ah, money.

00:33:09.832 --> 00:33:11.865
Well, money does matter.

00:33:11.865 --> 00:33:12.932
But what should I do?

00:33:12.932 --> 00:33:16.232
Looks like you're gonna lose quite a bit of money.

00:33:16.232 --> 00:33:19.932
You look like you're gonna lose
way more money than the others.

00:33:19.932 --> 00:33:22.232
What, what does that...

00:33:22.232 --> 00:33:24.665
Why me?

00:33:26.632 --> 00:33:29.632
Want me to tell you why?

00:33:41.499 --> 00:33:43.499
Hey, you. Take it easy.

00:33:43.499 --> 00:33:45.699
Thief. There's a thief!

00:33:45.699 --> 00:33:47.565
Where?

00:33:48.968 --> 00:33:50.499
Darn it.

00:33:50.499 --> 00:33:53.299
- Where's the thief?
- Over there.

00:34:13.332 --> 00:34:17.765
Go put on a show and come back in one piece.

00:34:21.765 --> 00:34:23.565
Catch him.

00:34:35.565 --> 00:34:36.999
Hup! Hah!

00:34:36.999 --> 00:34:40.232
That's right.

00:34:47.565 --> 00:34:49.532
Serves him right.

00:34:51.399 --> 00:34:53.365
More coming from behind.

00:34:57.732 --> 00:35:01.165
A plum blossom in a place like this...

00:35:11.865 --> 00:35:13.099
Oh, you startled me.

00:35:13.099 --> 00:35:17.332
You rat! You knew I was here
and did that on purpose, right?

00:35:24.165 --> 00:35:26.165
They say you shouldn't hurt
a person even with a flower.

00:35:26.165 --> 00:35:28.832
But you've shattered everything I believed in.

00:35:28.832 --> 00:35:32.165
Had you just revealed your status,

00:35:32.165 --> 00:35:34.899
you could've kept those principles.

00:35:34.899 --> 00:35:37.499
That wouldn't have looked very cool, would it?

00:35:39.032 --> 00:35:40.499
Open the door, Shin Won.

00:35:40.499 --> 00:35:43.532
- Hey, go open it.
- Shin Won.

00:35:51.362 --> 00:35:53.432
This is serious.

00:35:53.432 --> 00:35:56.232
Everyone, gather up.

00:35:56.232 --> 00:35:59.399
Kim Ji Pyeong is trying to get a chastity monument

00:35:59.399 --> 00:36:04.165
by forcing his 15-year-old
daughter-in-law to commit suicide.

00:36:05.499 --> 00:36:08.032
That's not the issue here.

00:36:08.032 --> 00:36:11.665
If this gets exposed, the entire village
will suffer consequences.

00:36:11.665 --> 00:36:13.532
What consequences?

00:36:14.199 --> 00:36:16.932
Taxes and labor demands will skyrocket.

00:36:16.932 --> 00:36:17.932
By severalfold.

00:36:17.932 --> 00:36:20.399
That's the punishment for falsifying
the Virtuous Widow monument.

00:36:20.399 --> 00:36:22.899
The village's status will be downgraded.

00:36:22.899 --> 00:36:24.665
- Taxes?
- Labor?

00:36:24.665 --> 00:36:27.165
They'll increase them? This darn country.

00:36:27.165 --> 00:36:28.365
Exactly.

00:36:28.365 --> 00:36:30.899
So what do we do?

00:36:30.899 --> 00:36:32.765
We need to storm in right now and say,

00:36:32.765 --> 00:36:34.065
'We knew nothing!'

00:36:34.065 --> 00:36:38.999
Show them we're innocent citizens
who came to save his daughter-in-law.

00:36:38.999 --> 00:36:42.999
Are we going to take the blame
all because of that man?

00:36:42.999 --> 00:36:44.932
Then there's no time to stand here.

00:36:44.932 --> 00:36:48.165
Let's go finish off that punk immediately.

00:36:48.165 --> 00:36:53.165
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:36:53.999 --> 00:36:57.736
Go honorably as the daughter-in-law
of the Kim family.

00:36:58.599 --> 00:37:00.765
I made a promise to my husband.

00:37:00.765 --> 00:37:03.899
I vowed never to follow him in death.

00:37:03.899 --> 00:37:06.765
We promised to meet again long from now

00:37:06.765 --> 00:37:09.199
and live together for a hundred years.

00:37:09.199 --> 00:37:12.765
Who would benefit from a death
that neither my husband

00:37:12.765 --> 00:37:14.399
nor I wished for?

00:37:14.399 --> 00:37:17.832
How dare you beg for your life
by selling my late son's honor?

00:37:17.832 --> 00:37:20.632
A will can always be forged, and as for a life,

00:37:20.632 --> 00:37:22.232
well, I could always end it myself...

00:37:22.232 --> 00:37:23.332
No, that won't do.

00:37:23.332 --> 00:37:25.532
Right, that won't do.

00:37:27.199 --> 00:37:29.632
Who are you?

00:37:29.632 --> 00:37:32.265
You, sir...

00:37:32.265 --> 00:37:34.132
Let me see.

00:37:34.132 --> 00:37:36.432
A silver dagger for slitting throats,

00:37:36.432 --> 00:37:38.032
a rope for hanging,

00:37:38.032 --> 00:37:41.465
and the water used for poisoning...

00:37:41.465 --> 00:37:42.999
It's obvious, isn't it?

00:37:42.999 --> 00:37:44.365
Who are you?

00:37:44.365 --> 00:37:46.032
How did you get in here?

00:37:46.032 --> 00:37:49.132
Is there no one outside?

00:37:52.699 --> 00:37:55.632
Now, abandon any thought of killing that woman.

00:37:55.632 --> 00:37:58.565
If I hear even a whisper that she's dead,

00:37:58.565 --> 00:38:03.165
not even three generations of your family
could take the civil service exam.

00:38:03.165 --> 00:38:05.632
If that woman dies,

00:38:05.632 --> 00:38:07.665
so will you.

00:38:10.665 --> 00:38:12.299
- Open the door.
- Who's there?

00:38:12.299 --> 00:38:15.199
- Who is it?
- You miserable punk!

00:38:15.199 --> 00:38:17.960
- Open up!
- Who's there?

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.165
Wait, wait...

00:38:19.165 --> 00:38:20.776
Hey, you!

00:38:20.776 --> 00:38:23.934
- You...
- Why is he tied up?

00:38:24.932 --> 00:38:28.365
That wretch Kim Ji Pyeong got what he deserved.

00:38:36.032 --> 00:38:37.865
Young lady.

00:38:40.865 --> 00:38:42.032
What a relief.

00:38:42.032 --> 00:38:44.299
Are you unharmed?

00:38:45.132 --> 00:38:46.565
What's going on here?

00:38:46.565 --> 00:38:47.599
It's unusual.

00:38:47.599 --> 00:38:49.232
It's a misunderstanding, right?

00:38:49.232 --> 00:38:51.165
It really does seem so.

00:38:51.165 --> 00:38:54.565
If you return to the palace
without arresting him, they'll kill us.

00:38:54.565 --> 00:38:57.399
Then let's just smile for now.

00:38:57.399 --> 00:39:00.199
Over there, over there!

00:39:00.932 --> 00:39:03.565
That's him!

00:39:03.565 --> 00:39:06.232
My lord!

00:39:10.399 --> 00:39:11.999
What's the matter?

00:39:11.999 --> 00:39:14.165
We received a report of a thief
and came to investigate.

00:39:14.165 --> 00:39:15.265
No.

00:39:15.265 --> 00:39:17.865
They tried to force this lady
to kill herself for the monument,

00:39:17.865 --> 00:39:21.299
but this gentleman here saved her.

00:39:21.299 --> 00:39:23.665
Is that true?

00:39:23.665 --> 00:39:26.376
Oh, well...

00:39:26.376 --> 00:39:29.165
The woman speaks the truth.

00:39:29.165 --> 00:39:32.099
I witnessed the scene myself.

00:39:33.099 --> 00:39:34.465
Arrest that criminal

00:39:34.465 --> 00:39:38.199
who defied the law and insulted His Majesty!

00:39:38.199 --> 00:39:40.399
Arrest him!

00:39:40.399 --> 00:39:41.765
Quickly, take him away.

00:39:41.765 --> 00:39:43.999
By the way, who are you?

00:39:43.999 --> 00:39:47.732
Ah, this person is the Crown Prince...

00:39:49.532 --> 00:39:55.499
Crown Prince specially appointed
him as a secret inspector.

00:39:57.032 --> 00:39:59.332
Show us your royal token.

00:40:05.299 --> 00:40:08.765
Are you Shin Won?

00:40:08.765 --> 00:40:10.565
Then, he's...

00:40:12.065 --> 00:40:14.599
- Your Highness.
- His Highness personally

00:40:14.599 --> 00:40:18.665
appointed him as the secret inspector.

00:40:18.665 --> 00:40:20.032
He's the secret inspector.

00:40:20.032 --> 00:40:22.399
His... Highness.

00:40:24.499 --> 00:40:27.399
Yes, my lord, I shall obey your orders.

00:40:27.399 --> 00:40:30.165
Good.

00:40:30.165 --> 00:40:31.499
Arrest the criminals.

00:40:31.499 --> 00:40:33.299
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:40:35.332 --> 00:40:36.932
It's over now.

00:40:36.932 --> 00:40:38.932
Don't worry.

00:40:43.732 --> 00:40:45.932
You vile wretch.

00:40:59.699 --> 00:41:02.532
Will you answer me now?

00:41:02.532 --> 00:41:06.732
Do you know what happens
if you catch a falling petal?

00:41:14.132 --> 00:41:15.765
Did you know that?

00:41:15.765 --> 00:41:18.632
If you catch a falling petal,

00:41:18.632 --> 00:41:21.132
your first love will come true.

00:41:45.599 --> 00:41:47.165
Why? Why?

00:41:47.165 --> 00:41:49.399
You said you didn't know,
but why keep following me?

00:41:49.399 --> 00:41:51.272
When did I ever say I didn't know?

00:41:51.272 --> 00:41:52.999
I just said you'd become the person
who caught the petal.

00:41:52.999 --> 00:41:55.532
So that means you don't understand.

00:41:55.532 --> 00:41:57.532
Since my business with you is concluded,

00:41:57.532 --> 00:41:59.632
you should leave now.

00:42:01.199 --> 00:42:05.064
But I still have unfinished business.

00:42:11.632 --> 00:42:13.999
Thank you

00:42:13.999 --> 00:42:16.332
for saving the young lady.

00:42:21.665 --> 00:42:24.065
No need for gratitude.

00:42:24.065 --> 00:42:26.184
I did it for my own sake anyway.

00:42:27.165 --> 00:42:29.132
To be precise, what I saved

00:42:29.132 --> 00:42:31.532
was that woman's late husband.

00:42:31.532 --> 00:42:34.265
If he knew she died like that,

00:42:34.265 --> 00:42:36.616
he'd wander the afterlife endlessly.

00:42:37.632 --> 00:42:39.793
This was done

00:42:39.793 --> 00:42:41.832
for a weak man

00:42:44.865 --> 00:42:47.528
who would regret it for a long time.

00:44:08.065 --> 00:44:13.199
My apologies. You looked so distressed, my lord...

00:44:14.199 --> 00:44:15.899
Was that supposed to comfort me?

00:44:15.899 --> 00:44:17.532
What right do I have to do that?

00:44:17.532 --> 00:44:20.199
What connection could there be
between your sorrow and me?

00:44:20.199 --> 00:44:22.265
There is a connection.

00:44:26.165 --> 00:44:28.899
Because of you, I've been

00:44:29.699 --> 00:44:31.699
trapped in a dream.

00:44:34.999 --> 00:44:37.932
A long-awaited

00:44:37.932 --> 00:44:39.832
nightmare.

00:44:44.565 --> 00:44:48.032
You look sorrowful even now.

00:44:48.032 --> 00:44:50.199
Then this time,

00:44:50.865 --> 00:44:53.465
how will you comfort me?

00:45:00.232 --> 00:45:02.899
Shall I buy you some soup rice?

00:45:02.899 --> 00:45:04.999
- So random?
- A full stomach

00:45:04.999 --> 00:45:07.299
warms the heart.

00:45:07.299 --> 00:45:09.432
It's not a bad idea.

00:45:13.132 --> 00:45:14.332
My lord.

00:45:14.332 --> 00:45:16.432
It's getting late, so you should return now...

00:45:16.432 --> 00:45:17.565
Very well.

00:45:17.565 --> 00:45:20.712
Buy me the soup rice.

00:45:23.499 --> 00:45:27.165
His Highness resolved the false chaste widow case?

00:45:27.165 --> 00:45:29.599
Did he want to imitate a sage king or something?

00:45:29.599 --> 00:45:31.965
Oh, hardly.

00:45:31.965 --> 00:45:33.432
He just stumbled into it.

00:45:33.432 --> 00:45:37.865
Even if indulgent, the Crown Prince
who cares nothing for politics,

00:45:37.865 --> 00:45:40.165
what kind of sage king...

00:45:42.065 --> 00:45:45.099
Whether stumbled upon or hunted down,

00:45:45.099 --> 00:45:48.865
a rampaging tiger needs a collar.

00:45:48.865 --> 00:45:50.899
Is Tak here?

00:45:50.899 --> 00:45:53.365
Yes, what can I do?

00:45:53.365 --> 00:45:57.099
It's been ages since you sent a letter
to Woo Hee, and she still hasn't come?

00:45:57.099 --> 00:46:00.832
The young lady remains stubbornly resistant.

00:46:01.665 --> 00:46:04.232
Send a palanquin immediately.

00:46:04.232 --> 00:46:06.732
Drag her here if necessary.

00:46:36.065 --> 00:46:40.299
You must enter royal marriage
with the Crown Prince. Come to the capital.

00:46:40.299 --> 00:46:42.232
If you refuse again this time,

00:46:42.232 --> 00:46:47.232
your father will burn down Sinjusa.

00:46:47.232 --> 00:46:50.999
We just need to buy up all the poison
in Yeongdeok and fetch water for it.

00:46:50.999 --> 00:46:52.199
What's the problem?

00:46:52.199 --> 00:46:56.265
Ah, this father-daughter feud
will boost the local economy.

00:46:58.699 --> 00:47:03.299
So you have no intention of marrying into royalty?

00:47:03.299 --> 00:47:05.632
My lady.

00:47:05.632 --> 00:47:08.932
You're already past marriageable age.

00:47:08.932 --> 00:47:13.632
Do you intend to grow old and die alone
as a solitary maiden ghost?

00:47:13.632 --> 00:47:16.499
- Not at all.
- But how long can you hold out?

00:47:16.499 --> 00:47:19.865
Do you think you can marry your true love?

00:47:31.932 --> 00:47:35.211
[One Year Ago]

00:47:56.432 --> 00:47:58.899
Would you like to try?

00:48:01.065 --> 00:48:02.732
I don't feel inclined to.

00:48:02.732 --> 00:48:04.799
Isn't it a tool to harm people?

00:48:04.799 --> 00:48:06.532
No, it's a tool to protect.

00:48:06.532 --> 00:48:10.232
If I fire this at someone,

00:48:10.232 --> 00:48:13.032
it's to protect something.

00:48:24.665 --> 00:48:26.899
Don't use this gun.

00:48:28.465 --> 00:48:31.199
I'll always

00:48:31.199 --> 00:48:33.999
hold your hand whenever you need me.

00:48:48.632 --> 00:48:50.769
Then I must

00:48:50.769 --> 00:48:53.399
protect him now.

00:49:20.365 --> 00:49:21.799
Hey!

00:49:21.799 --> 00:49:24.299
Park Dal I!

00:49:24.299 --> 00:49:25.599
You, you...

00:49:25.599 --> 00:49:27.065
What are you doing?

00:49:27.065 --> 00:49:29.565
Mother, Father, why are you here?

00:49:31.832 --> 00:49:33.799
Royal Inspector.

00:49:33.799 --> 00:49:36.165
About that soup rice...

00:49:36.165 --> 00:49:38.265
- What? Hey!
- Let's take a rain check.

00:49:38.265 --> 00:49:39.865
I must go now.

00:49:39.865 --> 00:49:41.065
- What is she saying?
- Hide, hide.

00:49:41.065 --> 00:49:42.099
You want me to hide?

00:49:42.099 --> 00:49:44.065
Wait, we came all this way. Where are you going?

00:49:44.065 --> 00:49:46.899
And if we're taking a rain check,

00:49:46.899 --> 00:49:49.265
you should specify the new time clearly.

00:49:49.265 --> 00:49:50.699
Well then,

00:49:50.699 --> 00:49:53.899
[Oh Hour: 11 AM to 1 PM]
meet here tomorrow at noon.

00:49:53.899 --> 00:49:55.065
Oh hour?

00:49:55.065 --> 00:49:57.165
If I come at noon tomorrow, we'll meet here?

00:49:57.165 --> 00:49:58.499
- Yes.
- What?

00:49:58.499 --> 00:50:00.499
- What?
- I'll take my leave now.

00:50:00.499 --> 00:50:02.417
Why are you acting like this?

00:50:05.699 --> 00:50:07.765
She really has parents?

00:50:07.765 --> 00:50:10.665
Is there more you need to verify?

00:50:10.665 --> 00:50:11.765
No.

00:50:11.765 --> 00:50:15.232
If there's nothing else, don't meet her tomorrow.

00:50:15.232 --> 00:50:17.299
But Shin Won.

00:50:18.065 --> 00:50:20.865
It doesn't disappear when touched.

00:50:23.165 --> 00:50:26.232
That's why I keep wanting it.

00:50:27.032 --> 00:50:29.099
Can't I just be

00:50:29.765 --> 00:50:33.165
a little shameless, even for a moment?

00:50:40.932 --> 00:50:42.299
Where do you think you've come?

00:50:42.299 --> 00:50:43.632
This is Hanyang! Hanyang.

00:50:43.632 --> 00:50:44.932
The capital where the palace stands.

00:50:44.932 --> 00:50:46.465
Do you have any sense of that, or not?

00:50:46.465 --> 00:50:49.065
Mother, Father, if something
happens to you, what will I do alone?

00:50:49.065 --> 00:50:50.765
Good grief.

00:50:50.765 --> 00:50:52.432
Why is she stealing my lines?

00:50:52.432 --> 00:50:54.232
The one who made the mess is angry.

00:50:54.232 --> 00:50:56.599
And furious, at that.

00:50:56.599 --> 00:50:58.432
Like I wouldn't be mad right now?

00:50:58.432 --> 00:51:00.765
The eunuch and the head court lady
who had an affair and escaped as sinners

00:51:00.765 --> 00:51:03.599
boldly came all the way to Hanyang?

00:51:03.599 --> 00:51:04.732
How did you find that out?

00:51:04.732 --> 00:51:07.499
That we were head court lady
and eunuch? Did your aunt tell you?

00:51:07.499 --> 00:51:09.699
What are you saying?

00:51:09.699 --> 00:51:11.365
I'd be so dumb

00:51:11.365 --> 00:51:14.099
if I didn't notice what Father's like every day.

00:51:14.099 --> 00:51:18.532
Father's constantly trimming
and attaching his mustache day after day.

00:51:18.532 --> 00:51:19.599
And Mother?

00:51:19.599 --> 00:51:21.832
You are fluent in palace terms.

00:51:21.832 --> 00:51:23.199
It's obvious at first glance.

00:51:23.199 --> 00:51:25.532
The eunuch and head court lady

00:51:25.532 --> 00:51:28.165
had an affair and fled at night.

00:51:30.565 --> 00:51:32.865
Clever, see?

00:51:32.865 --> 00:51:36.365
My son, no, my daughter is so smart.

00:51:36.365 --> 00:51:39.232
Is this really something to applaud?

00:51:39.899 --> 00:51:41.699
It's something to be punished for.

00:51:41.699 --> 00:51:45.332
Right. Before real trouble comes,
you two pack and leave first.

00:51:45.332 --> 00:51:47.199
I have something to take care of before I go.

00:51:47.199 --> 00:51:48.365
Good grief.

00:51:48.365 --> 00:51:49.832
Where are you running off to?

00:51:49.832 --> 00:51:52.399
You think only we're criminals?
You're a criminal too.

00:51:52.399 --> 00:51:55.465
Want to get caught wandering around
and live as a slave forever?

00:51:55.465 --> 00:51:58.999
I've spent years erasing even the mole
on my nose to avoid being caught.

00:51:58.999 --> 00:52:00.599
There's always a way.

00:52:00.599 --> 00:52:02.199
Carefully hide just like this.

00:52:02.199 --> 00:52:04.565
Yeah, leave her be.

00:52:04.565 --> 00:52:08.199
Thinking her plain face
needs a pretty slave tattoo.

00:52:08.199 --> 00:52:10.465
Wow, how glamorous.

Hanyang and Pyongyang.

Roaming around everywhere is my job.

You can just imagine all the merchants I know

00:54:56.699 --> 00:54:59.299

Can't. I have plans.

I'm having rice soup with the secret inspector.

00:55:08.299 --> 00:55:12.532
- The inspector?
- Your cousin I met yesterday.

He became a secret royal inspector already?

Ah, so you're not very close.

how can a prince's cousin take an official post?

Anyway, come to my place after eating.

Why would I go to a bachelor's house alone?

00:55:45.999 --> 00:55:47.832
Alone?

00:55:49.599 --> 00:55:51.699
Don't worry, I have many household members.

00:55:51.699 --> 00:55:54.299
Let's meet later then.

Ask my cousin where my house is.

And if you run away again,

00:55:58.465 --> 00:56:01.165
I'll report you to the Podocheong.

00:56:15.065 --> 00:56:17.699
Keep your eyes straight ahead when you walk.

But, she said she'd come.
Why hasn't she arrived yet?

Can I just eat first?

Do you really think that's okay?

00:56:51.099 --> 00:56:53.299
Wait, you rented this entire tavern
for that backpack-carrying porter,

Do you really think she's the same as you?

00:56:59.699 --> 00:57:00.832
What's the difference?

00:57:00.832 --> 00:57:02.365
The years I spent with Your Highness,

Even you can tell, right? Huh?

♫ It's all for naught ♫

01:04:31.299 --> 01:04:40.369
♫ What use is dreaming such dreams ♫

01:04:50.632 --> 01:04:54.965
How did you come here, my lord?

01:04:54.965 --> 01:04:57.297
Didn't we have plans?

01:05:07.165 --> 01:05:08.999
Let's go

01:05:08.999 --> 01:05:10.299
eat some rice soup.

01:05:10.299 --> 01:05:15.232
♫ Oh, will my love return to me ♫

01:05:15.232 --> 01:05:24.665
♫ Oh, how futile all becomes ♫

01:05:25.532 --> 01:05:28.832
♫ All but a dream ♫

01:06:00.565 --> 01:06:02.265
Take this road and leave Hanyang immediately.

01:06:02.265 --> 01:06:04.799
You, a lowly person,
must pay for that face you have.

01:06:04.799 --> 01:06:06.632
Why should I obey you?

01:06:06.632 --> 01:06:08.399
Where are you going?

01:06:08.399 --> 01:06:09.565
To propose.

01:06:09.565 --> 01:06:10.965
Didn't you promise?

01:06:10.965 --> 01:06:13.899
Are you speaking of rebellion now?

01:06:13.899 --> 01:06:17.532
So make your decision.

01:06:17.532 --> 01:06:20.765
Brother, do you trust me?

01:06:20.765 --> 01:06:22.232
I do.

01:06:22.232 --> 01:06:24.665
Because you're family.
