[Blood River]

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.980
[Based on the novel of the same name from Zhou Munan's Youth in Jianghu series]

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.980
[Available on fanqienovel.com & bkneng.com]

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.980
[Episode 36]

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.930
Changhe,

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.620
Master Mu and Xuewei are dead.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.180
Changhe!

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.410
I heard you!

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.710
They wouldn't have died

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.570
if we were around.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.740
We're members of Blood River.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:56.690
We're assassins.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.490
To us, life-or-death situations

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.050
are as common as our meals.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.660
So, to you,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.490
the members of Blood River

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.980
are still assassins, huh?

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.610
We haven't reached the Other Shore yet.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.500
And, we're still under the control of someone else.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.060
Do you understand

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.450
First Prince's plan?

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.820
He wants the generals and marquises, who were blackmailed by him

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.570
by turning their family members into drugged puppets,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.340
to cause a riot in Tianqi City

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.940
on the night before the Imperial Assembly.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.340
At the same time, he'll bring out the Dragonseal Scroll.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.100
He'll initiate both of these events

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.850
at the same time.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.260
After that, he'll frame Prince of Langya for them.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.290
Lastly, he'll show up to quell the chaos

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.690
by killing Prince of Langya.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.820
With that, he'll absorb Prince of Langya's faction

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.170
and pave a path to the throne he desires.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.570
Indeed.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.060
If someone were to mention that plan to me

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.740
a few months ago,

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.010
I would laugh it off.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.050
But now, it seems Prince of Langya

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.660
is in a tight spot as well.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.980
On the battlefield,

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.780
Lei Mengsha was defeated and retreated to Mount Luolei.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.500
In the imperial court,

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.220
the emperor no longer trusts him as much.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:13.820
And, his main guardians

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.570
have left him one by one as well.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.340
So, Changhe, are you choosing to side with

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.500
the powerful to reap more profit?

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.380
I'm driven solely by profit.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.410
That has always been my biggest strength,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.610
hasn't it?

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.270
But Prince of Langya has a reputation

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.600
of making the world tremble.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.690
Could he truly be this weak?

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.010
Could it be that he's using Blood River to his advantage?

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.780
Changhe, do you mean

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.380
Prince of Langya is acting weak on purpose?

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:47.500
Changli,

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.410
give me some time alone.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.660
You can take a stroll around Tianqi City.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.290
It's because

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.820
we'll leave soon.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.410
It's indeed

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.850
a city worth longing for.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.810
Especially at nighttime.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:21.730
It's just like

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.220
the saying...

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:27.660
What is it again?

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.410
"In heaven stands the White Jade Capital,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.610
with 12 towers and 5 cities.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.900
Immortals brush my crown,

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.540
granting me eternal life with a touch upon my hair".

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.580
I suppose Tianqi City does live up to its name.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.810
I was admiring the moon on the rooftop alone.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:51.780
But when I turn around,

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.410
a sword deity is standing right beside me.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.460
Greetings, Li Hanyi, the Xueyue Sword Deity.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.170
If you move,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.020
I'm afraid

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.290
my sword will draw blood.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.580
Xueyue Sword Deity, what are you doing in Tianqi City?

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.250
If so, Patriarch,

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.250
what are you doing in Tianqi City as well?

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.810
We came here

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:11.810
for the same person.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.980
It's Prince of Langya.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.250
Patriarch,

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:18.810
you're getting better and better.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.580
We can spar with each other in a few days

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.490
if the opportunity arises.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.900
This is news from

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.660
the Inner Security Division.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.740
[Imperial mausoleum, Zhuo Qing, Dragonseal Scroll]

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:50.290
I knew it.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.140
Li Zhengqi.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:27.490
Where are you?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.780
Li Zhengqi?

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.170
Why did I give birth

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.250
to a useless fool like you?

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:53.700
How can you face

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.290
the ancestors of the Li family like this?

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:58.460
Useless fool.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.290
You're a useless fool!

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.220
No wonder his son was forced

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.410
to seek out such a method

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.700
to increase his strength.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:07.930
I thought he was

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.370
a kind father

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.850
when I saw him protecting his son back then.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:14.900
Father!

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.610
I'll surely win the Golden Throne Contest.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.580
I'll definitely win the position of deputy general.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.900
You have to trust me.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.780
Fine.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.410
I shall wait for your good news.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:36.850
Forget it.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:37.810
I didn't come here

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.540
to peek at your past.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.410
How is it?

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:55.980
Your cultivation realm should be

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.250
completely stabilized by now.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.170
Uncle Zhe.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.490
Why don't you need to take any medicine?

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.540
I'm not injured.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:03.540
Why should I take medicine?

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.020
I merely

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:07.850
imparted some of my powers to you.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:09.050
Moreover,

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.020
my daughter also gave me

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.980
an acupuncture treatment.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.660
Right now,

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.410
I feel superb.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.100
She told me

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:21.850
that she'd help me to regulate my body

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.410
to deal with the long-term backlash

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:25.250
sustained by

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.370
the practitioners of Divine-Demon Nirvana Art.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.340
If it doesn't work out,

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.020
we can still depend on Baicao.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.700
I suppose I can rest at ease

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:34.850
if you'll be fine after this.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.530
That's all in the future.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:40.890
She said

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.390
that once the issue in Tianqi City

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:44.250
has been resolved,

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.220
she would take me with her to Medicine King Valley.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:47.890
She said

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.010
that there are several straw huts there.

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:52.060
There are also some cattle, sheep,

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.460
and a small vegetable plot.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:54.890
I suppose

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.060
life there will be dull and uninteresting.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.340
But luckily,

00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.530
there's a valley

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.250
filled with all kinds

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.100
of mystical herbs

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:03.060
and

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.890
the number one Medicine King in the world.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:07.340
She also said

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.010
that as long as they join hands,

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.130
even the envoys of Hell have to wait for decades

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.050
before they can reap one's life.

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:24.220
What do you think?

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:26.460
I think it's fine.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.730
If the two miracle physicians treat you at the same time,

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.010
I'm sure you can recover completely.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:32.580
That's not it.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.220
That's not what I mean.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:35.700
What I meant was,

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.020
what do you think about returning to Medicine King Valley?

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.770
Aren't you joining us?

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.220
All right.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.300
So, this is what it feels like

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.850
when one becomes a drugged puppet.

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:08.820
This is truly shocking.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.420
I'll end the session for now.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:16.890
Su Muyu?

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:30.180
Master.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:33.770
I'm fine.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.730
Li Zhengqi

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.300
has never met Su Muyu before.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.370
Therefore,

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.530
that wasn't his inner demon.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.770
It was my inner demon.

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.770
The Dragonseal Scroll surfaces, the world changes its face.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.580
When turmoil arises, Prince of Langya seals it.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.340
The Dragonseal Scroll surfaces, the world changes its face.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.890
When turmoil arises, Prince of Langya seals it.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.420
The Dragonseal Scroll surfaces, the world changes its face.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.300
Shut up!

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:05.220
Stop singing it!

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:06.130
Go away!

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:11.420
This never ends.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:19.850
Your Highness,

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:22.010
tomorrow's the Imperial Assembly.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:23.650
But for some reason,

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.610
the young beggars on the streets

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:27.250
were singing that rhyme.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:28.850
They also wrote the rhyme

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.890
on the walls of the streets.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.680
The people are saying

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.710
that the Imperial Assembly

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:36.580
is the day you ascend the throne in front of all officials.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.820
I suppose that's appropriate.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:45.610
In the presence of all officials,

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:47.300
the Mandate of Heaven was conferred.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:48.850
As the generals pledged their allegiance,

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.420
the Imperial Star moved eastward.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.060
And,

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:58.580
many of the generals under you

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.300
have delivered confidential letters to you.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:05.940
What did they say?

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.530
They were confidential.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:09.530
I dare not read them.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.460
I kept them in your study room.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:12.460
I'll bring them here.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:14.700
No need for that.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:16.530
Later,

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:18.180
take this fire pit with you.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:19.820
Burn all of the letters.

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:21.300
Do not leave

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:22.370
a single word behind.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.010
Yes, Your Highness.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.980
Are we actually sending them to retrieve that item?

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:29.340
Don't worry.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.060
Since Su Muyu

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.370
has already agreed to it,

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:34.770
he'll surely give it his all.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:37.820
This time,

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.250
I was the one who implicated Su Muyu and his men.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.700
Therefore,

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.340
both he and I

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:44.580
have to complete

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.300
our respective tasks.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.490
Bring me my fur cloak.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.460
Your Highness, are you heading out?

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.770
It's time to enter the palace.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.490
This time,

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.420
Ms. Wan'er helped us out of kindness.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.850
But her house was burned down

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:18.770
because of it.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.130
I truly feel guilty about it.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:24.700
Master,

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.830
Yu knew that you would say that.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.420
Therefore, he told me this

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:29.460
while you were preparing the prescriptions.

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:30.300
He said

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:31.420
Blood River

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.130
would compensate Ms. Wan'er with a huge manor after this.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.460
After all,

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:36.730
they have plenty of money in Yellow Springs Pawnshop.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:40.100
Master,

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.060
this is the last step, right?

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:43.490
Once you complete this prescription,

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.580
will it serve as a cure to the puppet poison?

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:47.820
Naturally.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.340
Master,

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:51.220
why did you separate it into two pots?

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:52.460
And, the herbs inside

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.340
are different.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:54.700
Your decoction is thick

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.820
while mine

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.340
is so clear, just like spring water.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.300
I thought I was boiling water.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:00.980
This pot

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.420
is the cure to the puppet poison.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.010
As for that pot,

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.300
I have my own use for it.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.100
I see.

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:21.100
Yu.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.140
[Imperial mausoleum, Zhuo Qing, Dragonseal Scroll]

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:28.890
It's tonight.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.820
We still haven't received any news from Changhe yet.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:31.890
Yu.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:33.700
Are you

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:36.340
the only participating member of Blood River tonight?

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.580
That's right.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.340
I'm the only participating member.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.940
I shall slay the specter, banish the shadow, and shatter the light.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:49.220
After that, we'll leave Tianqi.

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:52.700
A new Blood River

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.130
will be born

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.770
tomorrow.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:58.980
You didn't allow me to join you.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.820
Is it because

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.700
tonight will be perilous?

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:14.820
Indeed.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.340
Tonight will be perilous.

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:20.650
Life and death hang upon a single instant.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.370
But this is the path I chose

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:26.530
as the leader of Blood River.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:29.460
Therefore,

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.980
when there are obstacles ahead,

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:33.610
I shall split it open

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.420
with my sword.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.010
You may look gentle and easy to converse with,

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.770
but when you decide on something,

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.130
no one can persuade you to change your mind.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.220
But Yu,

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:52.340
you're much different

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:54.490
compared to the past.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.490
You have to be careful.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:02.530
I'll wait for your return.

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:13.220
The breeze is cold.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:14.490
And, the crows are cawing outside.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.460
Why didn't you close the window

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:17.820
and block out the inauspicious aura?

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.490
Inauspicious aura?

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:22.850
That's the present I'm giving to Prince of Langya.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.980
I'm listening to the mourning theme

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:27.060
sang by the crows,

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:29.370
which is meant for my uncle.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.250
After tonight,

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:36.220
Prince of Langya will become a permanent stain

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.850
on the records of history.

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:41.700
He intended to rebel.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:44.490
In order to blackmail the officials,

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.420
he kidnapped their sons

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.220
and even poisoned them.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.700
He tried to use them

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.250
to create

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.890
an army that neither sleeps nor rests.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.130
That's truly terrifying.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:03.490
As for us,

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.830
we're the righteous ones who have no choice

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:07.660
but to step in and stop him.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.290
This time,

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.460
I won't lose again.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:13.860
It's because his days are numbered.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.090
And, he's all alone.

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:22.090
You may leave first.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.090
Yes, sir.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.250
Lord Haoyue,

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:30.700
who served First Prince

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.730
together with us, died this morning.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.090
He died from a snake's venom as he failed his mission.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.180
Someone silenced him.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.220
So, I suppose your grandson

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.660
is simply grieving his own kind,

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.570
like a case of the fox mourning the hare, huh?

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:45.140
Mu.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.660
Mind your words.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.490
We're a family.

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:51.420
There's no need to be too formal.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.290
His Highness is summoning you.

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:57.290
Do not let him wait for too long.

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:58.530
If so, Grandfather,

00:17:58.920 --> 00:17:59.570
granduncles,

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:00.860
I shall take my leave first.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.010
Mu.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.420
Hurry, have a seat.

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:11.220
Once His Highness

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.530
ascends the throne tomorrow,

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.050
and we render merit in founding the new dynasty,

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:18.220
when that grandson of yours

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:21.330
is able to go on an expedition with the new Pillar State General,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.770
which is General Dian,

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.490
he'll understand

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:28.940
all of your painstaking efforts.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.860
But Xie, Mu,

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:33.940
just like what the child

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:35.180
was concerned about,

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:38.700
do you guys truly think First Prince

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:40.220
is worth serving?

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.730
Why not?

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:50.570
First Prince

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.460
hails from the imperial lineage itself,

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:53.860
and is the legitimate heir to the throne.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.620
He is the manifestation of light itself.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.330
Is there a better master than him?

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:05.810
Moreover,

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.700
the bow is already drawn.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.290
The shot has to be fired.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:10.860
There's no

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.570
turning back.

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.900
Xuanwu Guardian,

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.770
if I turn into a monster,

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.290
my father will never let you off!

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:28.860
Xuanwu Guardian,

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:29.730
what should we do now?

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:30.900
If they die here,

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.530
I'm afraid

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:33.250
the Inner Security Division will be blamed for this.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.620
The antidote has arrived.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:42.730
Thank you.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.250
The antidote has arrived?

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:45.730
Give it to me.

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:46.900
You caused trouble for us.

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.900
You'll take it last.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:50.330
Keep them under control.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:52.980
There's something off about their condition.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:53.980
One mouthful per person.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:54.810
No extra dosage.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.650
Yes, ma'am.

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:56.620
Hurry and give me the antidote!

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:57.550
I beg you!

00:19:58.050 --> 00:19:59.200
Give it to me!

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:00.480
Give it to me first!

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:02.900
Ms. Yumo, it's all thanks

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:03.730
to your timely arrival.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:04.980
I'm just here to deliver the antidote.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.180
If you want to thank someone,

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:07.980
you should thank Miss Bai.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:10.050
Miss Bai.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.180
Is the antidote ready?

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.420
Yes, it's ready.

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:17.530
It took me a lot of effort to make it.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:18.980
Ms. Yumo,

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.530
you must keep it safe.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:21.250
Don't worry.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.140
How should one consume this antidote?

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.090
Just take one mouthful,

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.420
and they will be cured.

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:29.220
Thank you.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:37.770
It took her a lot of effort

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.050
to create this antidote.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.180
Hurry and give it to me!

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:41.770
I'll surely pay her a visit

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:43.420
and thank her personally once this is over.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:44.420
Give me a little more.

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:45.290
Give me a little more.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.050
What's going on?

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.570
Is there something wrong with the antidote?

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.700
How could there be anything wrong with the antidote

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.250
made by Medicine King Valley?

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:15.530
It's you again.

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:17.090
That's right.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.420
I'm back.

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:20.810
Your favorite senior brother

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.460
is here as well.

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:28.050
Senior Brother?

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.330
Although Martial Aunt has neutralized

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.810
the poison in them,

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:33.900
it will only end if you neutralize

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:34.700
the caster's poison

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:37.490
or eradicate them

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.250
completely.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.010
Martial Aunt never read that book.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.940
Therefore, she doesn't know about it.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:45.730
But now, we know.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:46.810
As for you,

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.140
it's time to die.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.700
What a shame.

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:59.220
I thought Martial Aunt would be here as well.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:02.140
I wanted to get rid of her too.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:03.980
I guess I'll deal with you guys first.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:15.330
You recognize that he's your senior brother, right?

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:17.380
But he no longer

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.420
recognizes you.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.010
Such killing

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.660
is truly exhilarating.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.380
Shut up!

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:37.380
Are you okay?

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.530
Why aren't you using your three hidden weapons?

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.220
If I cast everything aside

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.220
and use all of my hidden weapons,

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:50.810
even if I do win the duel,

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.530
Senior Brother's body will be broken beyond repair.

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:55.900
It seems

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:57.460
you still need me.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.490
100-Spider Array,

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:03.420
rise!

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:20.730
Spider Woman,

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.290
do you actually think

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:23.770
you can kill

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:25.050
a Gold-Body Puppet

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.290
with those spiders of yours?

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.620
What if all of my spiders

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:29.620
had consumed this?

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:31.810
The antidote has already merged into their bloodstream.

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.050
Does that mean

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.810
it can neutralize your puppet poison?

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:47.180
Yumo!

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:50.140
Watch out!

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:07.940
That hurts!

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.010
This is Senior Brother's first time speaking

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:13.460
after encountering us.

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:14.900
The antidote

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.460
is starting to work.

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:20.530
Don't go there!

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.770
He absorbed Xuewei's poison before this.

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:24.180
After that, he absorbed all of the poison mist

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:25.660
at He-Yu Clinic.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.140
Now, his body is filled with poison.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:28.180
Have you lost your mind?

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:32.140
The poison in his body

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.050
has been basically neutralized.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.330
I just need to expel

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:35.530
the rest of the poison with my zhenqi,

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:36.570
and he'll be fine.

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.770
But the other poisons in his body aren't neutralized yet.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:39.660
It doesn't matter.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.050
I'm Tang Lianyue.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.180
Such poisons

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:43.770
won't affect me!

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:48.490
Lianyue.

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.900
Lianyue.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:54.330
Senior Brother.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.250
Lianyue,

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:02.140
kill me.

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:05.330
My internal organs

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:07.490
are all broken beyond repair.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.460
Just kill me.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:12.660
You want to die?

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:13.770
You wish!

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:25.900
Tang Lianyue!

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.810
Everyone will die if the poison mist

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.250
enters the building!

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.140
Senior Brother!

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.380
Kill me!

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:43.980
Kill me!

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:46.860
Lianyue!

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.490
Remember what I told you!

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:52.860
When someone

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:54.660
blackmails you

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:56.730
with my life,

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:00.290
you don't need to care.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:01.730
Just charge ahead!

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.660
Did you hear me?

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:13.860
Do it!

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:16.620
Lianyue!

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:34.900
Yumo!

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.810
I'm truly sorry.

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:43.010
Lianyue.

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:47.220
I'll entrust Tang Clan

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.940
to you now.

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:00.490

who blocked my attack on your behalf,

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.900
you have to cherish her.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:08.860

you ruined it just like that!

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:29.660
These three

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:31.010
were experts

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:32.330
nearing the Free-Heaven level.

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:33.860
It's a shame

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.900
that they weren't as talented as your senior brother.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.220
They cannot become Gold-Body Puppets.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:39.490
However,

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:41.420
they are more than enough

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:42.530
to deal with you two!

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.290
Yumo.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.770
Tang Lianyue.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:19.660
I...

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:23.860
I'll ask you

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:25.460
one last time.

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:31.220
Will you

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.730
marry me

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:36.980
or not?

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:42.770
I will.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:57.290
If so...

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.290
If so,

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:07.180
can you come to our Falling Stars Pavilion, then?

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:13.660
No one has held a wedding there before.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:16.810
Okay.

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:22.620
I'll follow your will.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:44.380
Can you make it grand?

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:47.250
This way,

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:50.570
it'll make me look good too.

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:55.940
After all,

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.290
I was the one

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.730
pursuing you all along.

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:03.490
In front of Yu...

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.530
I suppose I was pretty embarrassed

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:10.980
in front of Yu and the rest.

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:18.860
With rivers raging

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.330
and thunder splitting the sky,

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.490
I will ride the red phoenix to take you as my bride.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.570

Outside of Pipa Pavilion of Jiujiang,

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.660
I was known for my three hidden weapons.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:23.460
The first one is

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:25.140
Cries of 1,000 Birds.

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.770
The second one is

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.220
Skywrath Thunder.

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.900
As for the third one,

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:31.940
it's unleashed when I use Cries of 1,000 Birds

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.730
and Skywrath Thunder at the same time.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.770
It's called Phoenix Descent!

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:41.290
This is...

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.220
So, phoenix does exist, huh?

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:16.180
I'll take you with me.

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:39.050
Ruojin,

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:41.620
you summoned me here.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.940
I suppose you have something to discuss.

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:45.700
I heard

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:47.730
that there was a commotion

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.180
in Tianqi City today.

to the children's rhyme?

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:00.660
Could it be

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:02.700
that you also think

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.140
I would stage a rebellion

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:06.770
during tomorrow's Imperial Assembly?

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:18.090
There was one more Dragonseal Scroll.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.860
It's been so many years.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.860
Is it still nowhere to be found?

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:23.570
Indeed.

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:25.620
But it'll definitely

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.570
show itself today.

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:36.090
Ruofeng,

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:37.860
I trust you forever.

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:40.700
But you need to know this.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.290
Not everyone in this world

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:45.250
live by absolute principles,

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.770
unlike you.

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:53.570
Tonight,

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.290
I will retrieve the Dragonseal Scroll

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.770
on your behalf.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.010
As for tomorrow's Imperial Assembly,

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:01.010
nothing will

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:02.770
go wrong.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.250
I can rest at ease

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:07.290
upon hearing that from you.

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:02.380
The snacks were great.

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:04.090
The drinks were excellent as well.

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:06.740
Jin Xuan, I suppose

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:08.380
you were the one who prepared them.

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:12.380
I was just doing my duty.
